She is by far the best doctor I have ever been to. There are a few things that really stand out:

I always felt like Dr. DeVore cared about me personally -- she respected my personal values and my comfort zone, and she made recommendations that were tailored specifically to me. 

She is compassionate but also fully candid and honest. She never sugar coated any of the facts, and just as importantly, gave me ALL the information that I needed to feel comfortable about the decisions that we were making. She is extremely thorough in her analysis and detail oriented. I felt empowered and fully understood the process and next steps. After every appointment, I would walk out of the room, feeling like we made the right decisions. Not everything we tried worked out in the beginning, but the decision-making process and information was so clear and upfront, that we were able to pivot as needed. The entire IUI/IVF process can be extremely complicated, so this piece was HUGE.

Dr. DeVore always went the extra mile. In December, Dr. DeVore let me know that in Jan 2020, there'd be a new law which meant that some New York companies would need to provide full coverage for IVF treatment. Dr. DeVore did extra research on this, guided me through the process, and even helped me follow up with billing (and insurance) to make sure we had the information needed. She even wrote a personal letter to our insurance company to ensure everything was organized and in order before starting IVF. This was HUGE and such a stress relief as the process can typically feel very overwhelming given the potential costs. 

I really felt like Dr. DeVore cared. I know she has a busy schedule and tons of patients, but you would never know. Dr. DeVore gave her FULL attention and dedication to me at every appointment. Even if I had questions outside of appointments, she would get back to me right away too! I've never experienced that level of personal care and can't thank her enough!

</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">If you're going to see Dr. DeVore, you made the right choice! Best doctor at NYU </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Shannon DeVore made me feel so comfortable throughout the process. I always felt like she listened to me and understood my personal needs. Her recommendations were specific to my personal medical situation as well as my needs and life. She was caring and compassionate every step of the way. She took the time needed to answer all my questions and never rushed through. And, she was extremely thorough with her answers. I wanted to understand EVERY step of the process, every risk, and every potential scenario. Shannon was so patient and not only answered my questions immediately, but also gave me the level of depth that I needed so that I felt fully comfortable. I cannot tell you how much I appreciated Dr. DeVore's care, dedication and personal attention! </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">One of my biggest issues was the timing of ovulation as my cycles varied widely month by month. We started out by monitoring my cycles and doing a trigger shot. The first cycle, we learned that my follicles were not growing big enough by the time I ovulated, so for the next cycle, Shannon gave me Clomid to help with the follicle process. Although my body reacted well to Clomid, the first IUI was unsuccessful. The next month, I tried Clomid again but this time my body had a strange reaction to the medication and I had really bad cramps post ovulation. As a result, Shannon decided to pivot and put me on Letrazole instead. I really appreciated this pivot because I knew that Shannon was listening to me and not pushing me down a path (Clomid) that I wasn't comfortable with. In addition, that next month was Christmas and I already had plans to travel and see my family. She knew this was important to me so rather than doing a timed IUI (and having me cancel my plans), I took Letrazole and had sex normally (using ovulation sticks). When this didn't work, the next month, she suggested we try Letrazole + IUI again and simultaneously prepare to start IVF. She was extra careful and thoughtful about monitoring me during this time as she knew my ovulation could be pretty erratic. 4-5 days after my period, she had me come in for morning monitoring and found out I was surging. She told me right away, and then cleared her calendar so that we could do the IUI that afternoon instead of waiting another day. I probably talked to her 3 times on the phone that day to make the decision to do IUI right then -- and I'm so grateful I did!

At the same time, we were also preparing to potentially start IVF. Shannon spent so much time walking us through the process, explaining the medications, and the most cost effective solutions. She mapped out every step and scenario (we had so many questions!!). And then... in a crazy turn of events, the DAY BEFORE we were supposed to start IVF, I found out that I was pregnant! While we never went down the IVF path, I would have felt 100% comfortable if we did. 

In the first 7 weeks of pregnancy, she monitored me to ensure everything was going smoothly and even was there to show me the first heart beat! 




</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The NYU staff was very thorough an organized about calling me with results immediately, booking me for follow up appointments, ensuring our billing was sorted and organizing our insurance paperwork. It was never a problem to get in quickly for morning monitoring (I never waited over 5-10 min). And, they nurses were always friendly --- i felt like we knew each other after 6 months! In addition, we took a 3 hour, in-person course on IVF. I was kicking and screaming going into it because it meant I needed to miss a couple hours of work... but wow, it is so necessary. I highly recommend that everyone take this course before going down the IVF path</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">At NYU, the staff is very organized and thorough. Billing and insurance with NYU was a breeze (and honestly, it's always been a painpoint for me at other clinics). I felt that the facilities were clean, very well managed, and they ran a really tight operation. I would recommend booking your actual appointments well in advance so that you are organized and can plan accordingly. Secondly, I would recommend going to morning monitoring by 8am as it'll take 2-5 min to get in. At around 8:30 or 9am, it can take 15 - 20 min (which isn't bad, but it's helpful to plan). Lastly, I would do your homework on insurance! NYU is really good about making sure you have the information needed so make sure you listen/learn and follow up so that there are no surprises. The nurses always guided me to check with insurance on specific things (and in fact, called my insurance to confirm on my behalf many times too)</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Fully covered by insurance except for $25 co-pays each visit (thank goodness!)</div>]"

He is extremely smart, continues to do research and I find him to be candid and honest with me. After three transfers and no successful pregnancy, he is not only encouraging me to continue but ensures me that this process will result in a baby it is just a matter of time and numbers (at some point it will work).  He understands how frustrating that is and is constantly encouraging me and letting me know how well I'm doing despite the anxiety, fear, pain, discomfort and hormonal roller coaster.  I find him open to working with other doctors (even when he doesn't agree with their ideology), he is willing to try different things than what his normal protocol allows for. He is open to my suggestions and patiently answers pages and pages worth of prepared questions I have presented him with after doing my own research.  In dealing with autoimmune issues he has been particularly accommodating and his ongoing work on Chronic Endometritis has been extremely informative. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Don't be overwhelmed by the size of the office or the staff.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Nurses know my name, as does Dr. Grifo, all are patient, kind, attentive and in tune with my particular case. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">First retrieval cycle we did 150 Follistim, 150 Menopur. I had 13 eggs, 11 fertilized with ICSI. Did a fresh transfer and PGS tested the balance. Got 2 PGS normal embryos and 1 Mosaic.  After failed fresh transfer we did an endometrial biopsy that was positive for Chronic Endometritis.  Took months to treat that, once it cleared I did two frozen transfers that both resulted in chemical pregnancies.  The first frozen transfer was done with Estrace and an autoimmune protocol that included Prednisone, Plaquenil and IVIG.  The second FET was a natural cycle transfer with autoimmune protocol as well.  
This current retrieval cycle I am doing 300 Follistim, 150 Menopur and Letrozol. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I love these women! They are exceptional, all of them.  Caring, kind, compassionate and HUMAN.

If you want a boutique experience this is not for you. Despite its size, it is extremely well run. Signing in at the computer is arguably the only time I felt like a ""number."" I have never experienced a mishap or mistake on behalf of the clinic or a missed call etc. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">A lot of women in the waiting room, if you show up at the very end of monitoring hours you will wait for sure. But once you put your name into the system that you arrived, you will be called in turn (usually within 20 minutes at the very longest) and from there it is a well oiled machine.  You get to know all the doctors and PA's that are doing the sonograms and you know all the nurses drawing blood. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">For a self-pay full cycle, with PGS testing, transfer and medications the OVERALL cost (everything included) is approximately $24,000. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Grifo does not endorse multiple embryo transfer but is willing to do so at the patient's request or insistence. </div>]"

The rest of the time you deal mainly with the nurse coordinator and other doctors and technicians. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">He's not the doctor to see if you want personalized, individual attention from your doctor at every stage during the IVF process. I feel very confident with the level of care that I'm receiving and his oversight over my care, but there isn't much face time with Dr. Keefe. Their practice is so highly respected and has high success rates, that it's worth it to me. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Keefe is extremely empathetic and passionate about what he does.

I like it, because with unexplained infertility there is no one answer, no one solution and personal instincts and statistical numbers are the only two things to rely on. I had a polyp removal with Dr. Wertz, she mastered it perfectly. She didn't give me false illusions that this will solve my problem and it didn't. I had 3 IUIs and, again, I new the numbers and understood that chances are not very high. Even though I did have hopes, still my heart didn't break when this didn't work. I appreciated doctor's manner and support during this time, it helped me stay strong and avoid emotional rollercoaster. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Prepare to listen and make decisions. You come to doctor for a solution, not for compassion. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I, personally, am not very sensitive or sentimental about my infertility and don't expect (and actually dislike) compassion or pity from a medical staff. I like to overcome difficulties with a sense of humor and stay realistic and optimistic. Dr. Wertz is blunt, she provides accurate information and explains things clearly, giving me options to choose. I like that. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">My IVF treatment should start after the pandemic, hopefully, so I have nothing to say on that front. I did 3 IUIs and too Clomid. I responded well to it and had 2-4 eggs each cycle. I decided to cancel 4 egg cycle, even though the doctor didn't insist on cancelling. I didn't want to take the risk.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I absolutely love Dr. Wertz's assistant Sarnia. She's the best! Organized, on top of everything, just a great person and professional. Otherwise, there're a lot of nurses in a process, sometimes it seems as too much. I can't remember everyone's name and phone and duty. The IVF coordinator I got in touch with is rarely available, never picks up and appears overwhelmed. But the good thing is that all of them have access to information and know what's going on. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I didn't go through full IVF process yet, due to pandemic, but overall it seems to be organized. Human error may always happen and it's normal. I rarely have to wait too long, my insurance approval processes and billing is handled well. I had no surprises or miscommunications so far. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">My insurance covered IUI and I had to pay copays for ultrasound and insemination itself, $50 each. So in total I paid $300 for 3 cycles of IUI. IVF should also be covered, however genetic screening is not covered and will cost me over $4000 (up to 10 embryos, I may get reimbursement if less than 10), plus $300 for each embryo tested in a lab. I also decided to freeze good embryos, for future use, so this will be additional $7000 or more. I won't be surprised if any other charges will come up. </div>]"

After starting our journey with another doctor, when IVF became the best next step, we had to switch for insurance purposes. Our first visit with Dr. Grifo was comprehensive and very informative. He asked us a tone of questions, talked us through the science of the process in ways that we could understand and was sure to create space and time for any questions that we might have. My husband and I felt very comfortable with him and were eager to get started. Throughout my treatment, I  was fortunate to visit the clinic on his ""days"" which always made me feel better. He was always very thorough and would talk us through the implications of anything that was going on, offering encouragement and support. When our first transfer failed, it was very evident that Dr. Grifo was upset for us. He called us and scheduled a face to face to talk through options and next steps. He assured us it wasn't our fault and that there was hope in terms of next steps both traditional and more innovative, and even offered ideas based on his latest research. He suggested further testing to help inform the course of action. I  saw him for a biopsy, which was uncomfortable, but I always appreciated how Dr. Grifo would talk me through the procedure to help pacify any fears or discomfort. Lastly, we were very fortunate that Dr. Grifo was able to transfer our second embryo, which was successful! It was so great to have him there, and provide us with the confidence and calm that we needed. He told us it was his birthday, and that he had a good feeling about it! When we saw him at one of the first ultra sounds after being pregnant, it was clear how thrilled he was for us. He expressed his joy and confidence in us as parents, and allowed us to hear the heart beat as many times as we wanted! We simply could not have done this without him and we are so thankful for his knowledge and expertise. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">To be patient, and to understand that as much as you'd like to see Dr. Grifo every time you are there, there are doctors of the day for a reason. Trust that he is very informed of your journey, and is always available if you want to schedule a call or email. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Grifo was very encouraging throughout our process. He was mindful of both the emotional and physical demand of IVF. He was sure to communicate how none of this was our fault, talked us through each step of the process, and reassured us when things didn't go as planned. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">We used a series of injections to stimulate egg production/growth. I  was then monitored regularly to ensure the right dose/frequency and monitor progress. These injections included daily doses of gonal, a few of lupron, and then an ovulation stimulator to ensure ovulation occurred. I was also put on estragen to help encourage a healthy uterine lining for the transfer. During the retrieval process, we retrieved 28 eggs, however, the nurse suggested we use ICSI, to help ensure fertilization given my husbands sperm numbers, were just slightly under the amount they wanted. After the transfer, I was put on progesterone and estrogen to help support the pregnancy. When our first transfer failed, Dr. Grifo suggested a biopsy of my uterine lining to test for bacteria which could have influenced the transfer. It came back negative so he told us to move forward with another transfer. This time around, Dr. Grifo suggested that we might want to try something different just for our peace of mind. So we tried a natural cycle without the use of estrogen and just the use of letrazole. However, after my first visit, Dr. Grifo didn't really like that I  wasn't progressing and decided to put me back on the same cycle we tried before as it seemed to work better.  It did, and that is what got us to our second transfer with Dr. Grifo! After that transfer, he  put me back on the progesterone shots and estrogen, however, after I  told him that the shots were making me really sore, he offered my progesterone inserts to help alleviate some of the shots. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The nursing staff was very knowledgable, encouraging, kind and patient. They were very thorough when calling with results and directions. I  appreciated they also help talked me through the emotional implications of all of this. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">They are very organized. When you arrive, you check in with the video monitors, and wait to be called. The wait time was always minimal. You were escorted to the back room for blood work, if needed, and then into one of the rooms. They knew who you were, what you there for, and answered any questions which made you feel more like a patient than a number. While it was sometimes crowded, they clearly knew what to do and were able to make their way through each patient in a timely manner. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I  provided some of my thoughts on a previous question. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I  fortunately had good insurance which covered most of the costs of our first cycle with frozen embryo transfer. We did however, have to pay out of pocket for the PGS testing, about $7000, and then we had to pay out of pocket for the second transfer as it put us over my lifetime max. That was $4000. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Grifo shared his concerns about transferring one PGS normal embryo at a time. Given our embryos were normal, he was pretty adamant about his thoughts on transferring one at a time to reduce risks. However, he ultimately said that he'd do whatever we wanted. </div>]"

Dr. Hodes started our first cycle with timed intercourse and a low dose of Letrozole. I did not respond to the Letrozole  at all (even when the dosage was raised) or to Clomid during out next cycle. At that point, Dr. Hodes recommend my partner and I move straight to IVF. I was hesitant about this choice  for many reasons and after meeting with Dr. Hodes for another consultation, she agreed to let us try IUI with a very low dose of Gonal-F injectables. (Dr. Hodes kept me at a low dose due to concerns about OHSS.) I responded well to the Gonal-F and did not over produce. We completed one IUI but unfortunately the cycle was not successful.

That said, their lab is excellent and success rates for IVF are slightly higher here than at other clinics.  I would recommend going to the location on West 52nd street as much as possible and staying away from the 1st Avenue location when you can. If you have any kind of insurance coverage it's best to read all of the billing paperwork thoroughly and keep copies of everything. I was incorrectly told that I did not have coverage hit up for $500 per visit by the head of billing even when I explained otherwise. This person told me my claims had been denied and that I didn't understand my own coverage .  I found out later that she was not filing any of out claims with insurance. Eventually, I was able to get my insurance provider to send her an email explicitly stating that I was covered and my money was refunded. I want to assume that this issue was not a reflection of the institution as a whole but I did get the sense the NYU tries to make its patients pay out of pocket as much as possible. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">My insurance covered my appointments until I received an official diagnosis of infertility.

He also listened to me and my concerns while going through IUI and I felt that we came up with my fertility plan together, which helped make me feel more involved and in control. Dr Licciardi never pushed IVF on us even though he believes that will be our best route, but knowing we weren’t ready and wanted to give IUI a shot, he was supportive and helped us to try and make that happen. After 4 failed attempts we decided to take a break and I started acupuncture. He was supportive and even encouraged it. We will be starting IVF in May.

I asked Dr. Hodes on her opinion and she was very honest and explained the rationale behind it which is ultimately for the patient to give birth to a healthy baby. With multiple embryo transfer the pregnancy is at higher risk and does not increase the chances of a live birth.  I know that the clinic would consider multiple embryo transfers depending on the patients prognosis and history but they treat that case by case.  Dr. Hodes also went through IVF and had twins and she shared that information with me explaining how much harder her pregnancy and postpartum was with the twins vs. singleton.  I really appreciate her honesty and sharing her own personal experience .  Going through fertility could be lonely and having a doctor that understands not only the medical part but emotional is very helpful and beneficial to fertility treatment.</div>]"

I found this out at a later appointment. To which she also said I’d probably need a few cycles until we were successful. She gave honest expectations but was never hard about it. I feel she truly cares for the success of my cycle and was excited when we started. I was lucky to see her for all of my week day appointments and she even did my egg retrieval.

Not further tests were done to understand if there was another condition other than the obvious factor of age.

Most of them are nice and warm but the issue here is that there is nobody really following your case, nor they have the time.  for example:
1) i asked via email what to do with my leftover lupron? and why i had an unused medication called vivelle and what were those for?  to that i was left a voicemail that said lupron expires in 30 days.
2) i was told once by one nurse during a cycle, i am confused by your protocol not sure what to do.  
3) during the beginning of one of my IVF i realized i had a lot of medication left over from cancelled cycle.  i requested that the nurse only provides a prescription for what i needed.  but again since nobody is really following your chart she said she could not do that and would leave me on my voice mail the amount she requested to the pharmacy so i can cross reference with my inventory.  Then, i called the pharmacy myself to reduce the count of each medication.  it is important to call out that fertility medications like Menapure or Gonal can quickly add up to a bill of 5k to 10k depending of the amount.  so for me it was really stressful and careless to have gone about it in this manner.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">NYU fertility is a renowned for their in-vitro success rates.

You see him once in a while in the corridors, and if you are lucky, he'll see you for 1 ultrasound out of 15. When you catch him, in your first appointment or a consultation call post PGS results, he is indeed a star. He will give you his full attention, the full truth, and will be blunt about your chances, which I appreciate, but I can see some women not being a fan of. He knows his numbers inside out, which is great, but that in itself can make you feel like another number compounding that average, that median, and keep you on your tip toes secretly hoping for the moment he will pull you aside and say ""look, I followed your case day by day, I know a lot about you now, and you are not part of this statistic anymore... you are you and this is what I think!"" It's not going to happen, but emotionally I'm in that phase now, as I wait for for my 2nd IVF cycle yet (I'm banking after 1 PGS-tested euploid embryo already frozen).
The retrieval is performed by the doctor in attendance that day, so if Grifo is there 1 out of 5 days, your chances of seeing him are 20%. 
I just went through the embryo transfer course from Fertility IQ and am now freaking out about the performance variances across different doctors within the same clinic. Looking forward to touching base with Grifo to know his POV on this.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Try to take your emotions out of the equation as much as possible. Convince yourself you are making the best possible choice by enduring IVF: 1) you are maximizing your chances, 2) you are controlling the outcome (if you are doing PGS you are screening the best quality embryos in advance, and you are lowering your miscarriage chances to lower rates than mother nature), 3) you are taking an expensive, emotionally tolling, short-cut to starting a family, if time is of the essence for you. 

Personally, IVF me dread every evening of treatment, but I took one day at a time, and even tried to enjoy the fact that I was taking control over my destiny (vs. years worth of trying, especially if you are retrieving a high number of eggs per cycle --imagine the monthly disappointments, or even mourning a miscarriage (which happened to be in the recent past). 

Grifo is a matter-of-the-fact person, so if you are able to rationalize all the facts above, he is the doctor for you. He can be personable, funny, and charmingly smart.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">You feel like a human when you are seen by the team of doctors and nurses, but once you need a follow up call with one of the doctors or nurses, the answering system is efficient, but does make you feel like just another number. They will call you back, but it's often someone you've never spoken to before. Also, sitting in a packed waiting room and having your name called among other 10 names, definitely feels like a manufacturing plant scale... The 1:1 interactions are great (with with exception of billing), but everything else around it is of inhumane scale.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Gonal F, Menopur, Cetrotide and Lupron + HCG triggers. My body responded very well to drug stimulation, and all along, doses of Gonal F and Menopur were being adjusted by doctors so my follicles had time to mature appropriately. Cetrotide was taken to prevent early ovulation, and my triggers consisted of 2 days of Lupron and 1 day of HCG, at 36 and 24hrs prior to retrieval. Triggers are to be shot at specific times, so that generates a little anxiety, especially if you have to excuse yourself from a client meeting for a few minutes :( 
My 1st cycle produced 20+ eggs and 2nd cycle 20+ eggs again. Quality is very different from quantity, so if you can, PGS will give you a good reality check and ensure a lower miscarriage/bad surprises rate. 
I don't have final results yet as I'm still waiting on 2nd cycle results (1st one yielded 1 euploid embryo that is currently frozen).</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The FC NYU is a well-oiled machine. 1:1 interactions with nurses are great. And when you have to call for questions, the message service is tremendously impersonal, but efficient. Nurses will call you back in a couple of hours, and leave very unambiguous voice mails. They are great. 

A few of them are more talkative and will give you invaluable tips (that should probably be part of orientation), such as: 1) if you are doing PGS, what is the best possible way to optimize timing (brith control pills); 2) if you are using the Gonal F or Follastim pens, don't throw them away if they are not completely finished as you can get a full day worth of dosage in it, or even combine it with a brand new cartridge, representing hundreds of dollars of savings in the end; 3) don't buy all drugs at once, get supplies worth a few days, because you never know how quickly your body will respond to drugs, and you might get stuck with a ton of expensive drugs you can't return. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Not a state-of-the art clinic. Success rates, doctors, equipment were what mattered to me, but if you are looking for premium waiting rooms, 1:1 attention from your doctor during the full length of treatment, immediate responses to follow up calls, this may not be the clinic for you. The academic association of this clinic warrants a team approach, so you will have to trust the team of doctors' best practices, proven protocols, years of research and published papers. The few star doctors of the clinic will be there for you if you really need them. But you will need to be a very patient patient.

In FC NYU there are great embryologists, so if you fear your age is determining a lower quality of your eggs, you want that team looking at your embryos and performing biopsies. You also want to go for the PGS testing lab they recommend and trust their interpretation of results. 

One thing I absolutely loathed about this clinic was the billing department. Staff sitting there is misinformed, inefficient, insecure, and unprofessional. Even if you consider that dealing with any insurance is a dreadful process, the billing team should be 200% better at their jobs. Every time I know I have to deal with them, my adrenaline is through the roof. FC, please reassess billing staff + provide better ""client services"" training and make measurable improvements ASAP!</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Efficient well-oiled machine. Nurses are very personable despite the scale of the clinic. Well-mannered, up beat, rain or shine, as early as 7.30 on a holiday. They are GREAT!</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Depends. If insurance covers, the value per IVF cycle charged is lower (about $7,500), if you are paying OOP the iVF cycle is about $10,200. Retrieval anesthesia, cryo, transfer, PGS costs, drugs are all separate. I don't have all the info yet because of insurance processing delays, but if you are doing all OOP, costs are as follow (approx. total $: 24,000)

- $15,300 retrieval + cryo + PGS
- $1,000 retrieval anesthesia 
- $2,500 PGS lab testing (minimum fee, pending # of biopsied embryos)
- $5,000 drugs

Insurance scam I leaned about after many hours on the phone amidst my full time job: my Express Scripts insurance drug coverage gives me a lifetime max coverage of $4,000. If I process through insurance 1 pen of Gonal F 900 units, the cost is of $1,900. If I pay OOP, the cost is of $850 through the same pharmacy. So.... with my insurance I was hoping to cover at least 80% of the drugs I needed for 1 cylce, and with 2 pens of Gonal F (approx. 10% of the drugs I actually needed) my life time max was done! 

Appalling... specially when you read Australian blogs in which women go through 10 cycles of IVF for free...</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Not discussed with Grifo yet, but my philosophy is to take as little drugs as possible, especially after the recent bombarding I did to my body, and the fact that I have no issues ovulating and a well functioning endometrium. </div>]"

There is no doubt that he is has an extraordinarily scientific brain.  But along with this, he is compassionate, honest and caring with his patients.  Though NYU is large and sees many daily patients, not once has Dr. Berkeley or any of his staff made me feel like a 'number.'  In truth, Dr. Berkeley spends more time with us one on one that any other doctor I've ever known.  He always wants to make sure you fully understand what is going on in your treatment, both before and during any treatment course.  One very positive thing I will also say about Dr. Berkeley is that he is very pro-patient in his patient counseling.  I am sure many of us have experienced well meaning partners at times who have wanted to do treatments that require less financial risk, at the expense of not working as well.  He reminds partners in the room that it is, in fact, the female patient undergoing treatment that has to undergo the procedures, and that they should really be the ones to consult carefully before making any hard and fast decisions.  Dr. Berkeley is always in the patient's corner - and this is very reassuring.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Patients who are seeking an honest assessment of their fertility issues and chances at conceiving will do well under Dr. Berkeley's care.  He is kind and compassionate, but he is not a man who will sugar coat your situation.  If this is the type of doctor you seek, then you will be very happy with his treatment.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">We first tried a different fertility clinic which we promptly left before the first cycle commenced as we felt this office was not really on top of things.  After this experience, we decided to go to NYU and work with Dr. Berkeley after another friend gave us a good recommendation of him. Immediately upon meeting him, I sensed he had the wisdom of a highly skilled scientist, but the warmth of a family member.  Dr. Berkeley takes a considerable amount of time with his patients to get to know them, and thoroughly explain not only what he thinks is going on case by case, but his strategies for resolving the issues.  He is also a very straight shooter - and by this I do not mean he is brutal with his honesty.  He simply explains odds in a realistic yet comforting manner.  Although we had two failed cycles, we feel very happy under Dr. Berkeley's care and will soon be undergoing  a donor egg cycle as our main issue is diminished ovarian reserve.  I am so grateful to have found Dr. Berkeley and to be under his care.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Because of my age, Dr. Berkeley felt it was imperative to get started on a treatment course quickly.  Unfortunately, my diminished ovarian reserve resulted in two failed IVF cycles, which were heartbreaking to us.  When we were ready, Dr. Berkeley recommended that our best option would be donor egg treatment. We did not feel like he was pushing us against our will, or trying to 'sell' us on something.  It took us awhile, but we felt very comfortable with the decision we made to work with him to accomplish our goal using donor egg as our next step.  NYU is also really on top of making sure you not only understand what is going on in your cycle treatment, but also helping you through every step in the process, either with phone calls or emails. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">For this third cycle, Aleksandra has been my main nurse care coordinator.  She is personable, skilled, scientific and warm.  I could not be more pleased with her care and the time she has taken to answer my questions and reply to my emails.  She is a true compassionate caregiver and I am very grateful.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">NYU is a large place, and there are always many people in the waiting room.  Suffice to say, I have never once felt like a number at this clinic.  I am always greeted with a smile by my caregivers, who call me by name, and am treated with respect.  The billing process at NYU is always scary as you have to check out with full payment before you leave.  Some of those bills will bill enough to give you a coronary.  But hey let's face it - infertility treatment is prohibitively expensive no matter the clinic.  With this in mind, I am more interested in the type of quality healthcare I get for my money.  NYU has been a solid choice for us.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The costs are astronomical no matter where you end up going.  This is the reality of infertility treatment in the US.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">NYU uses the eSET approach unless the multiple embryo transfer is discussed first, and I believe this is used on a case by case basis.  I am comfortable with the fact that Dr. Berkeley uses eSET as I am in my 40's and already at high risk if and when I conceive.  </div>]"

This is my first IVF cycle but in talking with others, I think what I was on was very typical. Menopur 300, gonal-f 300 - daily for 8 days w/ antagonist Centrotide last 3-4 (?) days. Ovadril trigger shot. I am old to be trying this (45) but my hormones and all that can be tested leading up to this indicated it was still a possibility, though a long shot (Dr Noyes was clear about this but also not hopeless).</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Overall i think they are too overloaded. They do very well given this, but I think it can at times compromise their focus and care. I have found them primarily to be professional, knowledgeable, friendly and understanding of the trial the IVF experience is. But I did sometimes feel shuttled through an assembly line at times. At times they seemed as grumpy as we were to be there at 7 a.m. on a Sunday.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">This has been my only experience with a fertility clinic so i don't have anything to compare it to. NYU I think is one of the larger 'factory' types of fertility clinics. And, at times I did feel that. But, that said, they do have a pretty well-oiled efficient system and I felt confident I was in good hands and that if my cycle was cancelled at any point it would not have been due to human error or balls dropped. Also, in spite of the assembly line feel at times, most of the staff (medical and administrative) I encountered were friendly and had a personality and tried to make a human connection for that brief encounter. Overall, I was impressed that everyone clearly had a sense of and respect for the difficulty &amp; expense of this process. This was reflected in the tone of the facility and the care at each turn.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">It was well orchestrated for sure. I was never there for longer than felt appropriate for what needed to happen that visit. It was not perfect (first couple times, it wasn't clear who I was seeing for the ultra sounds (a doctor, my doctor, a tech?) or what they were looking for with the first couple visits) but I advocated for myself and if asked for more info immediately got it &amp; the nurse realized she had been too quick.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">it is the same as far as i know for all the docs at nyu... nyu cycle is 11,700 because I'm doing PGS (PGS is another 2-3,000 i think it is ...plus the outside lab fees)...there are other fees too. If I make it to transfer that will be 2,000 i think</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Her policy I assume is that of NYU's, which is single only - they wont do multiples. Higher risk of multiple pregnancies compromising heath and development of each other. I'd be a single mom if this works...so twins was not something I was eager to get out of this anyway. </div>]"

As I wrote earlier, he does always call back within a reasonable amount of time but doesn't always seem to know why I would be calling and he would answer questions that I think are significant pretty quickly, so that I wondered if he was considering all of my own unique information or just answering generally what he would tell a patient in a similar situation.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">He is very honest and up-front. Be in touch with him a lot if you want actual feedback re your protocol. Don't rely only on the nurses. He will not oversee your actual case but if you want him to check something, he will. I think in all of our cycles I only saw him in the ultrasound room once during morning monitoring periods.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Licciardi was great about calling me back when I requested a phone call, but he didn't always seem to know who I was or where I was or in what kind of cycle. As a result, I think I was addressing one concern while he was talking about something else, that I didn't even know related to me. When we had actual appointments, he was attentive at those times. Once, I ran into him on my way out after an IUI under his care/protocol, and he didn't wish me good luck or even smile; I thought this was a little odd, but then realized he was probably very busy and/or preoccupied.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">For the egg freezing/retrieval I think he went to highest dose on everything because of my age and other health issues. I was at first freezing eggs as a single woman (with my first doctor, not Licciardi) then embryos with partner for future use (with Licciardi) and eventually thawed the eggs I'd frozen with another doctor (now working with Licciardi) to make those into embryos and did 2 cycles of FET using the eggs from my youngest age. He had me on progesterone shots for one FET cycle, with estradiol pills, even though my cycle is very regular; I was never sure why. And I was on progesterone suppositories for the second FET cycle, no estradiol. I don't remember the egg freezing exactly as it was a few years ago but it was some combination of Gonal-F and Follistim and ovidrel. I know I didn't do the medication that you have to mix together at home when i did the cycle for freezing with him. I'm not really sure of his rationale for the egg freezing --  I guess it's the usual protocol he starts with then adjusts if it doesn't work? For the FET I also didn't know why we were using estradiol when estrogen always normal and I ovulate on my own. Second cycle of FET we tried suppositories because of the pain at my injection site. Also would only transfer one embryo at a time because he said was big risk in having multiples and did NOT recommend PGD or any other biopsy pre implantation. I think he said because egg quality was good. I did have an IUI with letrozole days 3-7 (was supposed to be days 5-9 but there was a miscommunication re what day my period actually started). Also used trigger shot in the morning about 27 hours before IUI. I got pregnant but miscarried around 9 weeks (I had been transferred to OB after heartbeat.) Went back for another IUI two months after miscarriage; not successful. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Very hit or miss. Some excellent nurses. Some not so excellent nurses. It seems in the five years that I've been a patient at NYU that things have gotten more like a factory and there is just a huge volume of patients, more than there was when I was first there. For the most part, everyone is cheerful and upbeat, but they don't all have the same level of experience and I was given misinformation at least once. Also came away from blood taking very bruised once or twice. Had to ice and it wasn't when I was having daily blood tests. On the plus side, if you do get to know one of the nurses, sometimes you can get that person's direct line if you want their opinion. Nurse's take of picture was sometimes different than my doctor's so it was confusing at times.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The staff at the clinic are friendly and upbeat and are generally good about being efficient. They are great about calling roughly when they say they will. Not as much personal attention as I would like because I have multiple health issues. If you are considering IUI, there is one nurse who i think is much better at it than the others but that might just be a personal preference. Be prepared to show up closer to 6:45 a.m. if you want to get in and out of monitoring fast. If you come later, definitely longer waits, especially if you need an ultrasound, too. Definitely be proactive and make sure to communicate with your doctor as much as you are comfortable doing. You must be proactive. I have not been to other clinics so I don't know how this one compares. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">It went relatively smoothly when I was able to be there by 6:45 a.m. Hours don't start till 7 a.m. but like everything in NYC, people get there early and start to line up. When I really needed some sleep and went in a little later, different story. Also, the nurses would ask me for my allergies and what medications I was taking each time even though it was in the computer. I started carrying a list. I think all they cared about was latex but if you have a long list of allergies that you yourself can't remember, it's frustrating to have to recite it every other day. Then sometimes the doctor would make a change of protocol and I wouldn't know why or know that I needed to have my partner there with me for consent forms. It sometimes went flawlessly, other times, not at all so.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">First round, years ago, all out of pocket and nearly $20,000 for an egg retrieval and embryo creation (for freezing). Then the clinic went in network and my 2 FET's were covered by insurance but I reached my lifetime maximum fertility benefit with the 2 FET cycles and everything is out of pocket. I haven't gotten the bill for the IUI but looks as if it will cost a couple thousand because of all the morning monitoring. (I never get the home ovulation test kits to work right for me so I chose to have monitoring done at the clinic and I required a lot during the cycle post-miscarriage.)</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">For me, he definitely was set on single embryo transfer and would not even discuss allowing me to have more than one embryo transferred. He would not budge.</div>]"

He was also great at reviewing the probabilities of women my age being able to conceive using my own eggs.  He is very knowledgeable and experienced in this field, so we trusted him completely.  He knows what he's doing.   The only critical feedback I would give Berkeley to date is communicating better with the patient 1) he didn't mention during the initial consultation how many rounds of ovulation induction and retrieval this might take, especially for someone in my age group. 2) Each failed cycle, we would have appreciated a sit-down face-to-face meeting rather than a follow-up phone call.  Since the initial consult and the first retrieval, I haven't really met with Berkeley, other than the occasional ultrasound during morning monitoring.  Depending on the schedule, I was able to see other doctors at the clinic during morning monitoring, retrievals, transfers, and other procedures.  Those other doctors, during my short and limited interactions, especially Grifo and Hodes-Wertz, exhibited greater empathy and compassion, which I viewed as a plus.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Go into your initial consultation fully organized and prepared with any prior lab work, medical history, genetic testing all relevant to fertility.  Also, make sure that you get clarity on exactly what blood tests and exams you'll need done or updated prior to starting any cycle; infectious disease panel, day 2-3 labs, semen analysis, mammogram, etc.  Also, know that you as patient will have to be the proactive one.  You'll have to make tough decisions on how many rounds of IvF you can handle, whether to transfer mosaic embryos (if that is all you have), how many transfers you're wiling to go through, and when to call it quits.  I understand why NYU Fertility doesn't proactively nudge you in either direction because they are first and foremost a clinic (not a research lab).  But likewise, don't expect any proactive outreachor guidance on whether to continue (unless explicitly advised otherwise) either.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I dealt mostly with the nurses and fellows.  Some of them were very nurturing, caring, and competent.  Others were less so.  Depends on who I got.

Dr. Berkeley is a very matter-of-fact, analytical doctor.  He gives you the straight answers and instill confidence in you that he's competent, experienced and knowledgeable.  That is the primary reason why we went with Dr. Berkeley for all of our IvF rounds.  His communication skills and bedside manners weren't always as consistent or strong.  But we knew that going into the journey not to expect any hand holding of any kind from Dr. Berkeley.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">For the first three ovulation inductions, he prescribed 225 Follistim or Gonal F, 150 Menopur, and Ganirelex.  For my trigger shot, I had to take 2 Ovidrels.  For the fourth ovulation induction, I had the same protocol, except he also added clomid.  

For the one frozen embryo transfer, I was on estrace, medrol, progesterone in oil injections.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Nurses overall were pretty good.  They communicated instructions pretty well and were generally good about returning calls.  A couple nurses in particular were outstanding - they were not only competent at their jobs, but patient with listening to and answering all questions, compassionate and caring, which went above and beyond.  Sandra, Nicky, and Lavina, were a few of the exceptional nurses; they were really kind, and I appreciated their compassion throughout the process.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Different parts of the clinic could get on the same page about protocols.  Seems like the patient coordinator and nursing staff weren't always communicating the same things - for example, when I can start my FET cycle while waiting my PGS results - patient coordinator said no, nurses said yes - that caused confusion.  Some of the preliminary lab test (infectious disease panel bloodwork) fell through the cracks so I had to re-do them.  Embryology lab messed up by telling the nurse 26 eggs were retrieved when in fact only 14 eggs were retrieved (26 was the incubator number).  And finance and billing weren't always the most responsive.  Anesthesiology messed up one of our bills.  

One thing I wished NYU Fertility could have provided is some type of counseling prior to the process and during the process.  I'm not talking about psychological support - because they had that, and frankly, we found unhelpful.  What I'm talking about is someone who was willing to walk us through what to expect in terms of the various decisions we would have to make, how to think through how many rounds, whether and how to make the tough decision on transferring mosaic embryos, how to manage pregnancy loss, when to call it quits, and someone we can provide feedback to directly (and not just some on-line survey after every procedure), etc.  Not just what to expect from a medical perspective, but the impact IvF, FET and mosaic transfers may have emotionally, financially, etc. Someone who acts as an advocate for the patient.  At this time, the nurse, patient coordinator, genetic counselor combined fill that role in limited capacities.  But as patient, we had to seek that out and connect the dots ourselves.  Perhaps this is a resource beyond the clinic's capacity, but that would have been helpful.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Morning monitoring was open without appointments between 7 AM and 9 AM. For the most part, that seemed fair and reasonable.  NYU was good about not having to bring you in unnecessarily.  One advice to future patients is if you're going in only for blood work, see if you can move up the queue, because I often waited a long time unnecessarily just to give one vile of blood.  You get mixed in with the rest of the patients waiting for ultrasounds.   </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Each IvF cycle for Phase 1 - that includes ovulation induction, morning monitoring, egg retrieval (not including Anesthesia), biopsy of up to 6 embryos (for PGS purposes), cryopreservation of embryos and transportation costs to reprogenetics lab was $15,150, out of pocket.  The Phase 2 - which is the frozen embryo transfer as part of this IvF cycle was $2000 out of pocket.   After our second IvF cycle, NYU began to accept our insurance, which helped with bringing down our costs.  However, our insurance did not cover biopsy, shipping/handling of samples.  Reprogenetics, the lab that performs the PGS tests,  had their own fees, which were all out of pocket.  We were charged $1000 base fee, plus $250 per embryo.    </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I was strongly advised by Dr. Berkeley, given my age, to do PGS and aim for a single embryo transfer.  </div>]"

Though we did not see him at most appointments, we spoke to him often and felt comfortable that he was overseeing our treatment throughout. We were not from NY, and Dr. Licciardi worked with us, to enable us to do part of our cycle with my local Dr. Dr. Licciardi does lecture around the world so he is not always in the office, but even when traveling his staff can usually reach him,</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Ask questions. He offers the information the average person wants to hear, but if you are like me and want to understand all the details, ask him to elaborate. He will, and he will explain it clearly until you are satisfied. Also, you can't separate him from the NYU, the clinic that he practices in - NYU is large, and it is important for you to advocate for yourself. However, we were happy with almost all the nurses and staff there and always knew we could go directly to Dr. Licciardi with questions or concerns. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The first thing Dr. Licciardi said to me at our initial consult was, ""it looks like you have been on a long road, and I know how difficult that is.""

When he spoke with us, he explained his recommendations and patiently answered our many questions.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">We had MF (low sperm count) and FF (PCOS). We came to Dr. Licciardi after having done a surgery for MF, monitored cycles and IUIs and having had one miscarrigae. We knew we wanted to move on to IVF. Dr. Licciardi recommended a basic IVF protocol  - gonal-f, PIO, ganirelix, doxycycline, ovidrel trigger - as our medical presentation made us good candidates for a basic cycle. Thankfully, he was right. We were able to transfer 1 fresh embryo, and froze 5 all of which were BB or above. We failed the fresh cycle - I believe my body was just too traumatized from all the meds of the cycle. We took a month break and came back for a FET, which was successful.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">We dealt with many nurses and there was only one we didn't care for. Overall, the nurses were very helpful. We did part of our cycle remotely and most of the nurses went the extra mile, following up with our local lab to ensure they got the blood work in a timely way. The nurses were knowledgable and caring. Again, NYU is a large clinic and it is important when dealing with so many different people that you are your own advocate and make sure the nurse you are speaking with is aware of the full picture.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">NYU is top center. It may have been overwhelming for us if it was the first stop on our fertility journey. By the time we got to NYU, we were reassured to be in a place with top doctors and labs, and were fine with not having the amenities of a concierge practice. If you are just starting out and using NYU it may be more challenging, though I would still recommend them.

I felt so comfortable from that first visit; I was depressed, angry and confused, and Dr Grifo was understanding of each of these emotions and offered suggestions to help.

He shared his personal story of infertility and feelings of helplessness and failure; can you even imagine a pioneer of IVF feeling like this, let alone admitting it? He made me and my husband feel hopeful, but again he utilized data to explain his beliefs and confidence.

For the transfer there was vaginal and oral estogren pills, as well as other injections. I produced 21 eggs for retrieval, 3 survived until day 5 and 2 tested normal w/ PGS.

My tissue from the D&amp;C had been tested, and it was triploidy, which he explained to me over the phone.  I advised him that Dr. Noyes, who had seen me during this very brief pregnancy mentioned during a monitoring appointment (as it began to become clearer that this was a missed miscarriage) that I had a uterine fibroid and had been incredulous as to why no one had pointed this out to me before.

The nurses were generally pleasant but when my short-lived pregnancy turned out not to be viable, I thought they could have done better.  The nurse who called me to inform me that my HCG levels were declining was a nurse I had never met or spoken to before, and she let me know via voicemail about my declining HCG level and that I should come back on in several days for bloodwork and an ultrasound.

He joked with us so that felt very personable. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">This was several years ago so I don't remember fully. Dr Berkley wanted to use an aggressive approach since I had a failed cycle  which did not produce many eggs though I have a high egg reserve with a different dr. I was on menupur and Folistim I over stimulated so they had to do an HCG trigger. I produced 28 eggs. He told me he was going to be aggressive since I had a failed cycle previously so I knew what to expect.

Since we did not do PGD testing He recommended that we transfer 2 embryos the next time. It became a successful single birth. The next transfer he recommends we transfer 2 again  he said statistically non PGD tested embryos will have a 50% success rate. So the statistics are in your favor when transferring 2. Knowing that I asked him why we didn't transferred 2 the first time as well. we only made 5 embryos so there would always be 1 odd one out and he didn't advise to transfer 3. The first one transferred was the best quality embryo so statistically it had a highest chance of success as it was. </div>]"

To my delight, I got 19 perfect eggs, and a 20th that was a little premature. Even he was a little surprised I think.

Dr. Licciardi was very upbeat with my initial assessment and FSH levels, and quickly got me started on testing and polyp removal to make my chances as high as possible (I had never tried to get pregnant and was doing this with donor sperm).  When my FSH levels subsequently elevated, he was sympathetic but to the point that I might get lucky with IUI and he would support that for 2 or 3 cycles.  I think some women might have taken that as uncaring, but I felt like he was only being honest and not judging me nor did he want to mislead me.  When I failed at IUI but my FSH and estrogen had improved I met with him regarding IVF.  He was not in favor of it, but said we could try and then he had a positive, supportive attitude throughout that process.  When it failed and I cried, saying I felt stupid for trying at my age (I was at that point 44 years old), he told me I shouldn't feel bad at all about that and he seemed quite genuine with his supportive comments.  I commented that I had a family member interested in donating eggs and he was very positive about it.  Overall, I think he is neither mushy-concerned nor cold about his assessments.  He seems genuinely interested in his patients and in helping them.  And when I pushed a little to do something he did not recommend, he quickly took my side.  This was important because I think being very downbeat about the process or feeling like your doctor is annoyed or unsupportive because you don't agree with him can make it all too hard.  I never had that kind of negative experience with him.  But he also was honest and ""to the point"" about the process at each stage, which might seem uncaring to some women.  I am not the kind of person who pushes hard to get my way, and I think that had a positive effect on my interactions with him.  I do not know if that aspect of my personality may have hurt my chances, such as when I only had 2 follicles with my IVF cycle (at a high level of hormone treatments) and he said we needed to convert the cycle to IUI.  I now feel pretty confident he made the right call.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The patient should expect honesty, but understand he and the clinic are trying to get good numbers.  He will recommend what he thinks gives you the best chance of success at having a baby, especially considering most of us have limited resources and usually can't do more than two IVF cycles with our insurance.  As a patient, you want to pull out all the stops.  I think that dynamic goes on with all the doctors. But I do believe he really believes in his work and wants to help.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Licciardi found the right balance of understanding/sympathy and honesty when I was unsuccessful and couldn't help but cry.  He also gave me a chance at IVF with my own eggs after honestly telling me that he would not recommend it, and he had a positive attitude throughout the process.  Finally, the nurse staff were very supportive of me during the various processes I went through.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">It's been quiet a while and don't remember a lot of details.  He recommended IUI cycles with HG injections to time the injections.  With IVF he went high on the hormones, which I think was right given my age.  He also said with IVF that they won't do retrievals unless there are at least three follicles.  I only had two so he recommended I stop the medications and just to HG injection with IUI.  With the donor egg cycle, we synchronized our cycles with birth control pills and then went to estrogen pills and progesterone shots daily.  I don't know the rest of the protocols for the egg donor.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">They were very helpful, but also very busy in the mornings.  The donor egg staff were very professional but very warm as the process went on.  The lead nurses on the regular staff were very kind to me and I appreciated it.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I really like the no appointment, two-hour window in the morning for the blood draws.  But sometimes there are problems/back-ups and you never know when you will have one of those mornings when everyone shows up at the same time and you have to wait quite a while.  So be prepared to wait and perhaps be late for work if that is where you are going next.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I don't remember much.  I think the first IVF cycle was maybe $10k or $12k before insurance.  The frozen embryo cycle was less than $5k.  Frozen embryo cost $1,200 plus another $1k annually for storage.  IUI was much cheaper</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Since I used a younger donor and told him I couldn't handle having twins, he was very supportive of doing just a single embryo transfer.

Talk to the person in the finance office that deals with medications and insurance. I was able to get my medication covered through Aenta Speciality Pharmacy. Aetna themselves did not tell me this, one of the patient coordinators at NYU told me to go through Aenta Speciality Pharmacy. 
The medications are brutal but you just need to power through it with your eye on the end result. 
Write everything down the doctors and nurses tell you during monitoring and nightly calls.  
Stay organized by inputting your medication doses and timing on the calendar on your phone. 
Keep track of your medication supplies daily, and check with the doctors/nurse weekly to be sure you have the correct supplies and enough medication to complete your cycle.

I was 42 years old and had failed a number of IUI and IVC rounds with injectable hormones, as well as two previous donor egg attempts at a different clinic.  Dr. Noyes was straightforward, candid, warm but a bit brisk (I am OK with that), and made it clear that she would give you as much or as little detail as you wanted.  She told me at the first visit that she thought she could get me pregnant ""one way or another,"" and she did. She originally planned to go straight to a donor egg cycle, but while waiting for a donor I unexpectedly got pregnant the old fashioned way (courtesy of my husband) for about ten minutes, until I had an early miscarriage. Still, that was enough evidence to prompt Dr. Noyes to suggest one more cycle using my own eggs.  We tried that, but it did not work.  Next, a donor became available and we had a long talk about how many embryos to implant.  I wanted to be aggressive, in light of my age and history.  Dr. Noyes eventually agreed to 4, with all kinds of contingency plans if I ended up with too many.  As it turned out, one took.  Dr. Noyes discharged me from the fertility clinic at 3 months but sent a lovely note when  my first daughter was born.  Somewhat amazingly, I got pregnant again -- also the old-fashioned way -- when daughter #1 was 6 months old.  Even though Dr. Noyes had nothing  to do with that (except, perhaps, in the karmic sphere) and she sent another lovely note when my second daughter was born.   Both girls are now in high school.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Don't be shy.
