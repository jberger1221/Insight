You have to keep pushing through. It's best to be very informed (beyond your conversations with her) to make sure you can get what you need from her...offered three potential IVF protocols based on my diagnosis and her experience with prior patients. She explained the pros and cons of each (including financial implications), provided her recommendation, and then let us decide. We chose the least expensive option as our first protocol (clomid and gonadotropins), which was a failed cycle with all embryos arresting before reaching blastocyst. After re-grouping with Dr. Austin, we went with the original protocol that she recommended, which was the most aggressive and expensive. That yielded two blastocysts, which we froze for embryo banking.</div><div class=\"review-snippet__excerpt review-card__show_for_clinic\">When I had issues with getting time with Dr. Austin after a failed cycle, Shoshanna [nurse at Cleveland Clinic Fertility Center] was in my corner and made sure we got an appointment...got some conflicting information from the embryologist and the doctor about the quality of my eggs. All in all, for what we're spending and for our future family being on the line, the clinic just wasn't for us...Linda, in IVF billing is great...has the strong reputation of the larger Cleveland Clinic organization and it's generally pretty well-run.</div></div></div>,\n",

She took the time to listen to and address all of our questions and concerns. Even though we saw various other doctors and nurses for procedures and monitoring, I felt good knowing that Dr. Tan was ultimately making the decisions about my care. I will say we did usually have a long wait once we arrived for appointments, but that’s because she takes the time to address all her patients’ concerns during each visit.</div><div class=\"review-snippet__excerpt review-card__show_for_clinic\">I had a day 5 transfer of one embryo [at Cleveland Clinic]. We froze two day 5 embryos and one day 6 embryo. (Initially I had 11 eggs. Nine were mature. 8 fertilized. They used ICSI on all mature eggs. I had 7 mature and 1 immature fertilize)...The nursing staff varied. I was never assigned to one specific nurse, and I think that’s just the way the Cleveland Clinic runs things.

More optimistic than was actually realistic or achievable.

Their care team in the fertility center goes above and beyond regularly for patients and is more sympathetic and caring than the general population of employees at the Cleveland Clinic.</div></div></div>,\n",

She sat down with us and went over all of the ins and outs of IVF treatment, hand drawing diagrams to illustrate retrieval, follicular growth on the ovaries, and all the stages of embryo development. She also spoke to us about exactly what steps were next in order to proceed and counseled us on any genetic testing and how it is done. She spoke with great respect about our previous RE but also stated she does feel that the previous Dr. can tend to be a little over-optimistic with patients about outcomes. I greatly appreciated the time she took with us (over an hour) and her candidness about our potential results. She is the head of the clinic and absolutely wonderful to work with so far for IVF. Her IVF nurses are also so thorough and compassionate.</div><div class=\"review-snippet__excerpt review-card__show_for_clinic\">It can be difficult to get appointments with the Cleveland clinic as a whole and the fertility center is no different.

She has a very kind and caring demeanor and she really listens. She was also happy to answer any of our questions and explained her initial hypotheses for our infertility and why she was recommending specific next steps. Now that we've completed all our necessary testing, it's taken a little while to get to our treatment plan. I don't necessarily think this is Dr. Flyckt's fault (it seems like CCF has some communication issues internally), but it's definitely frustrating to not be able to contact Dr. Flyckt directly or get a timely response.</div><div class=\"review-snippet__excerpt review-card__show_for_clinic\">My interaction with the nursing staff [at Cleveland Clinic Fertility Center] has been a mixed bag. For my consult intake, I thought the nurse was fine; she wasn't particularly friendly or pleasant, but she also wasn't unpleasant. Since then, I spoke to another nurse regarding questions about my HSG and medication and she was very helpful...The lab work and office visit were close to $1k... is a well-regarded medical facility and it's fairly well run compared to some other medical offices I've been to (granted, those other offices weren't fertility clinics). That said, trying to communicate anything in a timely fashion comes down to a giant game of phone tag.</div></div></div>,\n",

This was decided due to my diminished ovarian reserve. She said the results are good using this even sometimes having better quality eggs from a person with a diminished reserve. She said she would expect 3-6 eggs to be able to retrieve from any stimulation course we selected. I showed a positive response in my estridol on the clomid so we proceeded with that. I am in the middle of my cycle looking to trigger tomorrow. But as on right now I have 2-18mm, 1- 16mm &amp; 2-11mm follicles. Hoping a couple more are more mature come the day of retrieval.

But I think I have come to like how the Cleveland Clinic works as a team. The doctors meet daily mid day to discuss all patients under a cycle of monitoring. After the meeting they communicate to you via the nurse. As first it felt a little rocky but once we got going my comfort increased. You do have mychart messaging available to send messages directly to Cynthia and she always responded very promptly!</div></div></div>,\n",

For someone with endometriosis and no Male factor that has tried for quite some time post-op with no success or only chemical pregnancies I would see that skipping IUI and going directly to IVF would make the most sense and he performs that work as well.... he's still a very warm doctor as far as compassion but at the same time is forward in what you need to hear. I think almost any patient wants exactly that.</div><div class=\"review-snippet__excerpt review-card__show_for_clinic\">I think that a patient should expect that almost corporate feel because of how large the Cleveland Clinic is.

She even drew spots on my side so he knew exactly where to put them...The clinic procedures could be improved upon. There is a disconnect between the ultrasound department and the IVF staff. I'm not sure why. I believe the entire process of ordering IVF ultrasounds should be streamlined. Always double and triple check your appointment times and arrive early!

She does her possible best to explain your condition. I think she is a nice lady. From my observation, she appears to treat a certain way and does not appear to try other course of treatment or render other solutions.... I started with the clomid flostim protocol and that is what I used for the first two cycles. The third cycle, she used a different medication as flostim was on back ordered. She prescribed a high dose of the medications to try and stimulate my ovaries. If my memory serves me right, she did really try different options or protocols. Not sure why. She didn't recommend I take any vitamins, supplements or do anything else different or in addition that would assist. If you ask about any other alternatives, not much was provided, she didn't object to my ideas either.</div><div class=\"review-snippet__excerpt review-card__show_for_clinic\">[Cleveland Clinic Fertility Center's] Location was convenient for me. One stop shop. Neat and clean. Older building, can do with a facelift. But okay. Everyone keeps to themselves, not much interaction amongst patients. Would be good if patients spoke to each other and strengthened/encouraged one another during the journey. We all know why we are here.... My first nurse during my first cycle was fantastic but retired. The second nurse was so so. The third nurse showed compassion. This journey of fertility can be challenging and treating patients care and compassion goes a long way.</div></div></div>,\n",

As if 29 was way too young to be considering having children.

We then moved on to IUI with provera and trigger shots [with Dr.  Jeffrey Goldberg]. The fourth IUI resulted in a positive pregnancy test, with a ectopic pregnancy. I had to have two rounds of methotrexate and I was monitored closely. Dr. Goldberg suggested we move on to IVF because of the risk of ectopic (I had two prior to this one)...takes the time to explain everything and makes a specific plan for your needs.</div><div class=\"review-snippet__excerpt review-card__show_for_clinic\">[The nurse at Cleveland Clinic Fertility Center is] Very attentative. Always takes your phone call or calls you back if she is unavailable...Cleveland Clinic is one of a kind, you feel like you’re getting the best treatment. State of the art equipment (such as ultrasound equipment, labs, etc.). Beacheood is conveniently located and there’s a mall next door if you need to waste time between appointments/tests.</div></div></div>,\n",
