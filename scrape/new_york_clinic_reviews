She never pushed me to do something I was not ready to do, and let me set the pace of my treatments. When I decided to take a short break between cycles, she was very understanding. She is also very straight forward and matter-of fact with results and reasons for those results, and she doesn't sugar-coat, which I appreciated and which added to my trust of her. When I received bad news after a few cycles back to back, Dr. Rudick sent me a very nice email and I felt that we were  in this together, working toward a common goal. Although Dr. Rudick was not always available at every visit, all of the doctors and nurses at Columbia were pleasant to work with. Before and during each procedure, Dr. Rudick would explain each step in detail, which helped ease my anxiety. I felt very cared for by her and the team at Columbia.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I would tell her that she is in good hands, to trust the process, and to ask a lot of questions to ease anxiety and understand all of the details and risks. At points, it can seem like there are no answers and it is all trial-and-error, but with each cycle, more information is gathered that will lead you toward the right treatment for you. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I was treated like a human, Dr. Rudick was very patient with me, and was always available by email or by appointment to go through all of my questions. She made me feel like I had full control over the process, and that it was up to me to decide how aggressive I wanted to be, and the pace at which I wanted to proceed.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">After several tests, we were diagnosed with unexplained infertility, which can be very frustrating. We decided to try IUI first. The first cycle of IUI was with Clomid, which was not successful. The Dr. switched me to Letrozole for the next three IUI cycles. I felt a lot better on Letrozole (much less bloated). Unfortunately, these cycles all resulted in biochemical pregnancies. We met with Dr. Rudick to discuss next steps, and she recommended IVF with genetic testing as she suspected a chromosomal issue in the embryo was the cause of the biochemicals. We proceeded with this recommendation, which produced two normal embryos. We transferred one of the embryos and this resulted in a positive pregnancy. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Julissa and the nursing staff were very organized and pleasant to work with. Julissa always called me and/or emailed me with results around the same time of day, the day after testing. This was very consistent and eased my mind, because I knew when to expect to hear from her. I felt that I could reach out to her if I had any questions about medications, treatments, etc. When I started my first IVF cycle, Julissa met with me and showed me how to mix and administer each medication, and gave me tips on how to organize the meds and make it easy. She also sent me links to instructional videos online. The information was very helpful and eased my anxiety. I also got to know the phlebotomists; they were always nice and would greet me and say hello when they saw me. I felt like everyone was rooting for me.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The clinic has a very calming atmosphere, and is very clean. There are plenty of seats for waiting patients, and several bathrooms. There was always water available and fresh fruit.
The reception staff was very pleasant each time I arrived and check in was quick. The process during morning monitoring was consistent, and I hardly ever had to wait more than 5-10 minutes after my scheduled appointment time to be seen.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Fortunately, I had fertility coverage under my health insurance. I did have to pay some costs out of pocket up to the deductible. I also had to pay for the embryo freezing and the Genetic Testing separately, these were not covered by insurance. All in, I feel that I paid close to $8,000 out of pocket in total.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Rudick recommended transferring one embryo at a time, to avoid a multiple pregnancy.

He and his team understood that these things mattered and what a difference it makes when your concerns are taken seriously.

I can’t recommend Columbia University Fertility Center enough.

</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I do not have a uterus but still have my ovaries. IVF, creating and freezing embryos and using a gestational carrier was the only strategy. It was all pretty straight forward for everyone. I declined using birth control because I had LH test strips to tell me approximately when my first day of cycle would be. He then monitored my blood work until we knew when to start everything. My injectables were Menopur, Gonal F &amp; Cetrotide.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I had Katrina and Tiffany as nurses. They did their jobs well.

</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I can't recommend this clinic enough. The only things that I would hope for other to avoid are things that they can't necessarily control. 1) Make sure your procedures are pre-authorized well in advance. Speak with your insurance yourself and know for sure that pre-autho went through. 2) One of the third party companies that they work with, Igenomix that is used for PGS testing, relies on your IVF doctor to explain things that I believe should be their responsibility. The only thing that the clinic can do to help avoid a lot of frustration when it comes to finding out your results from Igenomix is to explain to their patients that 1) Currently, NY state law does not does not allow companies like Igenomix to disclose mosaic results 2) Explain that mosaic results from Igenomix are handled differently and how. 3) Interpret the results from Igenomix completely for the patient before they try to do it for themselves with an Igenomix rep.
Again, all things that I believe Igonmix should explain before someone uses their services considering it has to do with their results and the service that your paying them to do, not the clinic. Igenomix should be saying, “You should know that that NY State law prevents us from disclosing information about mosaics…”, “this is how we outline our results. we conclude mosaic embryos are also abnormal embryos so you wouldn’t use them anyway… (paraphrasing that last part… that’s not exactly right)..”, “This is how you interpret our results, here is an example”.

For those frozen transfers, we did estradiol to thicken my lining and then progesterone in oil. After 1 miscarriage and 2 failed transfers, we decided to do a second egg retrieval. This was the same protocol. During that retrieval, Dr. Forman did a scratch test to see if there was any inflammation in my uterine lining. There was a few plasma cells found, so I took an antibiotic for that. We also went back and figured out which protocol provided my thickest lining and we decided menopur and Gonal f would gain the best lining for me.

I did not have Dr. Brady do the egg retrieval because of a conflict in my work schedule, but she did do the egg transfer. I was extremely nervous about the transfer because I ended up with only 1 genetically normal embryo after PGS screening, but I was impressed with how carefully and smoothly she preformed the transfer.

I was surprised and disappointed that this was considered a good result for my age. I was expecting and hoping to have at least 2-3 good embryos.

We liked our previous doctor and were a little apprehensive about have to switch doctors, after we had successfully produced 2 embryos with our other doctor. Dr. K was very clinical when we first met her. She went over and explained some of the lab results that the previous doctor had done, which he hadn't seen before. She appeared very knowledgeable and while we might not have completely understood everything she was talking about, she definitely knew what she was talking about and that made us feel secure. Once treatment started, Dr. K was much more personable and human. She was very much invested in my treatment. She answered my emails promptly and was there during the major events in the treatment.

Dr. K at first was very clinical when we first met her. I think she was trying to be reassuring that we were in competent hands and that she knew a lot. We definitely felt like she knew what she was talking about. She went over the work ups and the previous egg retrievals we had undergone with the doctor she was taking over from. As the treatment progressed, she warmed up much more and I got to know her better at every blood or ultrasound appointment. If she wasn't the one doing the ultrasound, she would go out of her way to come in and look at the results before I left. She was very invested in my treatment. Once we graduated from the IVF treatment,  my mother came to see her to thank her in person. We all hugged and took pictures. She is a special person and an amazing doctor.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I can't remember everything but I do remember that Dr. K. decided to change my treatment and drugs from what my previous doctor had done, so that my eggs would grow at an equal rate and there wouldn't be a variety of mature and not mature eggs during the retrieval. After that cycle of IVF rendered no good embryos, she changed things up again. Then we got 1 good embryo from that. Dr. K performed the embryo transfer and we are currently in our 5th month of pregnancy. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Everyone at Columbia was extremely friendly and compassionate, from the front desk receptionists to the technicians taking blood, to the nurses and care coordinators.

She was always available for clarifications. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">When my husband and I arrived at Columbia University, we were impressed with the offices and suites. It is a bright, clean, and welcoming place. The running of the office is very efficient. You never wait too long for routine blood work and ultrasounds. The hours were convenient (7am appointments). They are also open 365 days a year even on New Year's day. The nurses call or email you with next steps within the day. The medication orders are sent to the specialty pharmacy seamlessly. It's really a wonderful place.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">When we tallied all the costs, after insurance we spent about 15K out of pocket. During our very first appointment, we talked to a financial adviser who clearly outlined the costs of all the procedures, ones covered and ones not covered, with our kind of insurance. We were satisfied with the outcome and the 15K was worth every penny. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I believe her approach was to lean towards single embryo vs. multiple embryo, which was what we wanted too. She was very up front when we asked her about our chances of conceiving after the transfer was done.

They discovered that I had endometritis which can take months to treat. I was very frustrated and discouraged after this diagnosis. Following diagnosis I went through 4 rounds of antibiotics and uterine biopsies to try and get the inflammation of my uterus to go away. The process was long and daunting. When I finally tested negative for endometritis we got the green light from her that we could move forward with our 3rd embryo transfer. the day before our transfer Dr. Karipcin was nearly giddy telling us that she had chosen the best embryo for tomorrows transfer and she seemed as excited as we were!

It was A to B. When we got to B we stopped assessed and moved to C. It was never a check the box feeling I had when working with this office. I also felt that Dr. Williams viewed my health as a priority. After my third miscarriage (2 natural, 1 IVF), another clinic said I should jump right into another cycle. I felt like something was missing and I needed to know that I was okay. Dr. Williams took a step back and ran test after test until we were comfortable with moving forward. I also felt that the office walked me through everything to make sure I understood the procedure. At another clinic I was told to watch youtube videos to figure out some stuff.

She is so thorough and thoughtful, always considering what more we can do to achieve a healthy pregnancy. She treats me as an intellectual equal and answers all my questions without ever rushing me or making me feel like my questions are silly. She was new to the clinic after my first round of IUI and I am so grateful to have switched to her care. I feel like she is fully invested in my case and always up to date on the latest research. Of all the doctors I have seen at the clinic, she is the most warm and personable. I seriously can't say enough about her. She is absolutely the best. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Ask all the fertility questions you have ever had! She will answer all of them! </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Brady has taken the time to really get to know me. She remembers everything that is going on with me, including in my life outside of fertility treatments, and checks in with me personally. I email her often with questions and she is always prompt to reply. When I had my first miscarriage, she seemed almost as upset as I was and offered a much needed hug. She is just personable and authentically human. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">With my first round of IUI, the Clomid caused ovarian cysts that took a while to go away. After that she switched me to Letrozole and I had no problem with it. When I began IVF, she monitored my follicles closely and raised the dose of Gonal-f and Menopur as she felt necessary. Considering my low reserve, I had a good egg yield during that cycle so she kept my doses the same during the next one. After my first round of IVF, I waited to do a frozen transfer and it didn't take so after the second round, we did a fresh transfer. All along Dr. Brady has been recommending that we do genetic testing of the embryos but we declined because of cost. In my first pregnancy, we had heard a heartbeat at 7 weeks and everything was proceeding normally. Then, when I went in for my last appointment with the clinic, Dr. Brady discovered at that time that the baby's heart had stopped beating. In disbelief, I asked the next day if she could check again and she invited me in and even had another doctor take a look. She recommended a D&amp;C and testing of the contents of conception. The results of the testing showed that the baby had trisomy 9. I was grateful to know this as it helped bring closure to the loss. After that, Dr. Brady proceeded with additional testing (including additional blood panels and an endometrial biopsy) to make sure we cover all our bases before doing another transfer. I just lost my second pregnancy very suddenly at 6 weeks and when I informed Dr. Brady, she asked me to bring in the tissue I had passed so she could send it off for testing. She wants to schedule a meeting with my husband and I next week to discuss additional genetic testing and how we can try to prevent additional miscarriages. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Karen was my nurse until she left just recently. She always provided very clear instructions and seemed very caring. Her replacement seems a little less warm and less clear about instructions but I will see how she does moving forward. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">When I was a new patient, the clinic was just moving to a newly renovated penthouse office in the same building. The new clinic carries all the state-of-the-art equipment and it is a beautiful office. I don't think I would ever leave this clinic. All the doctors are super knowledgeable and professional and the rest of the staff is so friendly and warm. They all know me by name at this point and they seem genuinely interested in talking with me. The office is also very efficient. I never wait very long at all for morning monitoring or procedures. Everything about this place is great and I can't imagine going anywhere else. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Monitoring is super easy and fast. Monitoring occurs from 7am until 9:30am, 7 days a week. I am particularly grateful for the early hours because it takes at least 45 minutes to get from the clinic to my school (I am a teacher) and I can still make it to work on time if I go in at 7am. Since everyone at the clinic is always so pleasant and friendly, it's not a bad way to start the day. They really make it painless to have to get up a little earlier to go to a monitoring appointment before work. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Each procedure has been different so it's difficult to say what each cost has been. Also, my insurance covers some parts of treatment. So far, we have spent around $5,000 total. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Brady has been adamant about transferring one embryo at a time for the health and safety of both me and my future child. At this point, I only have 2 frozen embryos left and one didn't make it to the blastocyst stage until day 7 which apparently means it's of lesser quality. Dr. Brady previously mentioned transferring those last 2 together so I am going to follow up with her about that the next time I see her. </div>]"

There can be a lot of chatter and giggles at the front desk sometimes, which also feels inappropriate given their surroundings.

She answered all our questions and made sure to get every preliminary test done so that we could have all the information we needed to move forward. As we progressed through 3 IUIs she suggested the option to move towards IVF but I didn’t feel pressured by her at all. She gave us all the information we needed to make the big decision and was willing to work with anything we wanted to do. After two IVF cycles, I inquired about donor eggs as well and she gave me all the information about that process, even though we weren’t ready to take that step yet. Another thing I really appreciate about Dr McConnell is that she always goes out of her way to be the one to do my morning monitoring if she is in the office. It’s a big office and for monitoring I don’t always see her, but I appreciate that she looks out for me and is there when she can be. We have developed a nice relationship and we are able to joke and connect as people not just as doctor and patient. I trust her expertise completely and I feel very lucky that I found her on my first try with a doctor. I will say that I don’t particularly need a doctor who is gushingly warm so Dr McConnell is great for me. She is sensitive when needed but tends to be very matter-of-fact which I appreciate, but I mention here because some people really might want a more warm bedside manner. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I would advise any prospective patient of Dr McConnell to ask any questions they have because she is more than willing to answer and fertility treatments can be daunting and there is so much to learn. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. McConnel has a warm and direct bedside manner. She is very knowledgeable and factual and will answer any and all questions, but she is also caring and conveys enough warmth and compassion as she shares options, test results or the like. She always calls me personally with information to share about my results, particularly when they are difficult like when the last PGS testing resulted in no viable embryos. She is not pushy and is willing to go along with the ideas I suggest as well as help me understand what other options are available. I have appreciated her warm candor a lot. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The first three cycles I did a basic IUI protocol with Clomid and a trigger shot. Dr McConnell has diagnosed me with low ovarian reserve, a blocked Fallopian tube and some male factor infertility in my partner but she wanted to start with a least invasive procedure and work up. I appreciated this because it also eased me into the treatments and shots as the IVF cycles we did later were much more involved. When we did our first IVF I was on Gonal-F, Menopur and later Cetrotide to prevent premature ovulation al followed with a Gonadotropin trigger shot. We did subcutaneous injections for everything - except the trigger shot. This first retrieval yielded 3 eggs but none made it to blastocyst stage. The second retrieval cycle we did a similar protocol but she upped the Gonal-F dosage to 450 from 300 units. That time we got one embryo and did a transfer supported by Oral Estrogen and Progesterone shots. The transfer was unsuccessful. We went back in for a consultation and decided to adjust some things for the third round including doing all shots intramuscularly - which Dr McConnell said could possibly increase absorption rates. In addition to the Gonal-F and Menopur, the third time she added Lupron shots. This time we retrieved 5 eggs and 3 made it to blastocyst but after PGS testing unfortunately none were genetically normal so there weren’t any to transfer. If we had done a transfer however, Dr McConnell had gotten me going on a mock transfer cycle to test my uterine lining with an ERA procedure to give us more information about the quality of the lining so that we could adjust the dosage of Progesterone or estrogen as needed to get the lining ideal for implantation.   </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I was assigned Nurse Katrina as my care coordinator and she was great. She would always return my calls quickly and was very helpful with any questions I had during the process. All the nursing staff I encountered at this office was great. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The Columbia Fertility office is awesome! They average length of my morning monitoring appointments was about 20mins which I really appreciated because I can have an appointment at 7 and still get to work by 8. They assigned me a person for financial questions, a nurse care coordinator, and someone to help with pharmacy issues. There was always someone I could ask to get any question answered. They are always friendly and I am on first name basis with a few of the receptionists and phlebotomists. I feel very comfortable there and welcome and really at home there. Even though they have so many patients they really try to make you feel welcome. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">This is all very relative to the patient’s insurance but for me I usually had a $25 copay for the morning monitoring. The IUI costs were largely covered by my insurance per NYS law. I had a few balances I had to pay but it wasn’t much. I also had three rounds of IVF covered through my husband’s insurance, so there were costs associated with that, but again not all out of pocket. The PGS testing was a separate $3000 to a company each time and we had some other costs associated with freezing some of my husband’s sperm due to his travel in zika areas. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. McConnell had a strong preference for transferring only a single embryo with my situation. I think it makes the most sense because I have only gotten one viable embryo after three transfers. She also doesn’t think that there is enough evidence that multiple embryo transfer increases chances. For me it wasn’t a big deal because I didn’t get many embryos anyway, but I can see this being an issue for others.</div>]"

I had previous IVF treatments at 2 different clinics across NYC and went to Dr Forman after being suggested to go for an egg donor with my previous clinic. Dr Forman took a lot of time to read through my reports and understand our case. During our 1st visit, he told us that we are too young and early in our journey to give up and can try different protocols. 
I went through 2 IVF cycles with Dr Forman and he changed the protocol during each cycle to try something new so that it could give me a fresh chance to get more embryos due to poor egg quality. 
Even when we were undergoing our transfer process, he insisted we try a natural cycle transfer protocol instead of doing the usual medicated ones to see if it helps increase our chances. 
Dr Forman's communication is immaculate!

He really took a lot of time to understand why my IVF response was poor to make a customized plan for me </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">With my previous IVF cycle, I did not get any embryos due to poor egg quality. During our first IVF cycle, Dr Forman reduced the dose of Menopur for the first few days to help curb my estrogen levels since my eggs were maturing too early leading to poor egg quality. The cycle lasted a few more days but he wanted to ensure that the follicles were a good size and did not mature too early before retrieval. I was able to get 1 day 6 embryo from this cycle. 
With my 2nd IVF cycle, Dr Forman tried the long Lupron protocol to help improve egg quality. I was doing a micro dose of Lupron for about 2-3 weeks before starting actual IVF medication. This cycle gave us 2 embryos. 
We then did the ERA test since we had 2 failed transfer cycles with our very first IVF treatment at another clinic. Dr Forman wanted to make sure that we were transfering the embryo at the right time since some women have shifted windows of implantation. The test came back at the right window for previous transfers. Dr Forman then decided to do a natural cycle transfer for us to try something new and see if it works better with my body this time. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Christine was my nurse and care coordinator and she was great.

Within one week of meeting Dr. Williams for the first time, he had figured out the source of our infertility (Asherman’s syndrome) and had scheduled the first surgery we needed to work on correcting it!  Within 6 months, the corrective procedures had been completed and we were ready to try again—and WITHIN ONE YEAR, we were pregnant with our daughter who was born months later!

Columbia provides many opportunities to communicate with your own doctor. Most of the time, it’s your own doctor provides the ultrasound, so you know the status.  

Dr. Rudick impressed me early on as being both intelligent and attentive.  She is very thorough and very quick to get what’s on my mind. She made me feel positive and gave me confidence. 

The process of drawing blood can be uncomfortable, but the staff at Columbia were friendly and compassionate. I love Arula. She made my day when she successfully drew the blood in one shot from my hard-to find vein.  Jenny is very patient. Patrice is always smiling and sometimes she does it herself, despite being the lead nurse who assigns tasks. Pam, the most senior staffer, gave us very detailed training. I deeply appreciate advice to avoid google searches, and not to make any guesses.

The administrative staff is also great, particularly Sofia. She has a passion for her work, despite being relatively new. She takes everything seriously and is focused on the tasks at hand.  Without her help, I won’t be so fortunate. 

The last item I want to mention is the billing department; they made difficult issues very simple.  I am able to match their bills with my insurance EOB’s. If I came across any discrepancies, Miriam provided a detailed explanation and an immediate fix.  This is in sharp contrast to prior experiences, in which the bills were tough to decipher and help was not consistent.

I went out of my way to come to this location because the one in Manhattan is such a zoo. You will still have to go to the Manhattan location for procedures like IUI, egg retrieval, and embryo transfer. For those procedures you never know which Dr you’re going to get.

Both times I used injectables (Gonal F and Cetrotide) to prepare for the egg retrieval. For the first cycle I did a fresh embryo transfer using 2 5-day blastocysts. When this cycle was unsuccessful, Dr McConnell had a follow up appointment with my partner and I to recommend PGS testing for the next cycle. We had 4 embryos tested and 2 were deemed chromosomally normal. I transferred one which resulted in my current pregnancy, and the other is still frozen for a future transfer. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Chrissy and Angela are both wonderful nurses.  They are both extremely knowledgeable and personable.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">CWRC definitely had a factory feel because they treat such a high volume of patients, but it’s my understanding that all NYC clinics are like this. I had over 30 appointments at the Manhattan location. This location was very hit or miss in terms of the service received. Sometimes I only waited for 10 minutes for an appointment, and the staff was pleasant, other times there were long waits and the staff was curt and rushed. My worst experience was when I waited for 3 hours for my first embryo transfer, which was really difficult.  This whole process is so emotionally fraught and my anxiety built with each hour that passed. But the worst part was how it was dealt with - my partner kept checking in with the receptionist, and he continued to assure her that we would be seen in “5 minutes,” which clearly wasn’t happening. When it became clear that she was getting upset he had the Dr on call come out and talk to us. When we complained that we’d been waiting for 3 hours, she replied “yeah, well I’ve been working for more than 3 hours.” It was just an obnoxious comment that was totally unnecessary. After that experience is when we switched to Dr McConell. The staff at her Scarsdale office are all wonderful, pleasant, helpful, and knowledgeable.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Monitoring is done between 7 and 9, and at the Manhattan location there was often a wait.

Due to female cycle irregularity and male low morphology Dr. Douglas suggested clomid with better timed intercourse at home or we could go straight to IUI.

I'm fairly confident I've only come in contact with 3 actual nurses. They were all very nice. The medical assistants and phlebotomists are pretty terrible. The call the first name and last initial for you to do blood work. I thought the woman was calling my name so I said are you saying ""first last"" and she just kept repeating what she was saying and not answering my question. Once we got back there she said ""we only say the first name and last name initial"" which is totally fine but answer when i tell you my full name. Also, my rubella immunity came back low. I got the booster (and had to sit that cycle out). Two months later they call me back and ask me if I got it. I told them the date I received the booster and said I thought the record should be in my file but could have the doctor's office resend it. Then they went back and forth about whether they needed to draw my blood to test for it again. They were basically asking me if they should. I told them ""I got the booster so if I'm not immune at this point there is nothing I can do and I'll have to take my chances. But if you need the blood test for me to continue with my treatment plan then do it."" It just felt like they had no idea what was going on.

If insurance wasn't covering my treatment I would be really concerned about the confusion if I was the one paying for all these tests. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The doctors are one of their strengths. The medical assistants and blood work assistants are a weakness. The front desk staff is pretty friendly, empathetic and helpful although some more than others. One thing I've realized is they have a lot of patients and a lot of people that have done this before but I have to remind them this is my first time with a fertility treatment plan and to explain things a little more. At the initial consultation a nurse explained all the tests I needed to get and she assigned me to a financial counselor. The financial counselor is great- she gets things sent to my insurance for approval right away which I appreciate.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I think the initial consultation was $550 if not covered by insurance. They were very up front about that. Our insurance covers all treatment associate with IUI but won't for IVF if we get to that point.

She was seldom available and I only managed to see her once.  Again, I feel that fertility treatment protocols are quite individualized and it is very hard for me, as a patient, to just see whomever is available that day and you can tell they just literally just flipped through your chart moments prior and are now going to decide the course of your treatment.  It might be okay with some people, but since I was paying fully out of pocket I was not going to take that gamble.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">At my first appointment, Dr. Rackow was more than 2 hours late.  She apparently had an emergency at the hospital.  I understand OB emergencies happen and as a health care provider myself, I know it happens.  What I don't understand is the front desk staff, they knew she was running late when I checked in but never said anything.  It was only when I overheard the front desk telling other patients to either wait or reschedule that I went up to the front desk myself to inquire, since I had waited nearly an hour by now.  At this point they told me that I actually hadn't been waiting that long because they allow 45 minutes of the new patient appointment for us to fill out paperwork.  I'd never heard of this and I've never needed 45 minutes to fill out new patient paperwork.  They then basically said I could come back another day or reschedule.  Dr. Rackow's schedule is not very frequent and I had already canceled my patients for the day to see her so I opted to wait, I got lunch at Whole Foods and then came back to the appointment.  The entire time the front desk seemed to not care and never bothered to inform me that she was going to be in late.  

I stayed to Columbia against my better judgement (I also trained there so I guess I felt some sense of loyalty), but after the cattle-call morning monitoring visits where I without fail would have to wait nearly an hour and a last minute appointment cancellation by Dr. Rackow, I left the clinic after finishing the infertility/RPL workup.  I could not even get a follow up to discuss the results because Dr. Rackow is just never there.  I had it with Dr. Nataki Douglas.  I made the appointment for first thing in the morning to minimize wait time.  At 20 minutes past my appointment time, I saw Dr. Douglas and some staff roll in the office with coffee and doughnuts, apparently they had gone out to get coffee and no one seemed to care that there were patients on the schedule.

 That really solidified it for me.  Since I was paying fully out of pocket, I felt I couldn't do treatment at Columbia because it just seemed like no one cared at the office.  To me, fertility treatment is quite individualized and when I finally saw Dr. Douglas, I could tell she just read my chart right before the appointment and offered standard treatment options without taking my medical history into consideration.  

 </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">My insurance only covered up through diagnostic testing.  I left after the diagnostic testing.  Did not start treatment at Columbia.  Little did I know I would be haunted by billing issues for another 9 months. 

PLEASE CHECK YOUR BILLING STATEMENTS!!  I will highlight 2 issues:

1.)  On my first visit with Dr. Rackow, as you see from above, was delayed greatly, and Dr. Rackow spent approximately 30 minutes with me going over my medical history and then suggested some lab tests.  I was then shuttled off to speak with a nurse who went over when I was supposed to come in for baseline bloodwork, since I was an IVF newbie.  Imagine my surprise when I then got a bill from Columbia for $404 for a 60-minute office visit with Dr. Rackow. They billed under code 99205, look it up if you're curious but I guarantee you the criteria under which the clinic was allowed to bill under that code did NOT happen at my visit. Obviously I did not ""clock in"" or ""clock out"" the visit but honestly the least amount of time I spent at that office was the actual appointment with Dr. Rackow.  When I called the office to inquire, the billing department said they would speak with her and get back to me.  They actually did call me back, only to tell me that Dr. Rackow said she had spent a significant amount of time that I was definitely there for an hour.  I'm not even sure if Dr. Rackow remembered me as a patient and I thought it was pretty impressive that she remembered how long she spent with me.  The ironic thing is when I had another new patient consult with my current RE at another clinic, I was bracing myself for another $400 visit.  My new RE saw me on time, ACTUALLY spent over an hour for the visit, and the office only billed my for a 45 minute visit, which was only $118 out of pocket for me.

2.)  I was double billed by Columbia for lab tests.  Columbia did the blood collection but the analysis gets sent to another lab, typically Enzo Labs.  There was a lag by Enzo labs for some genetic tests since they had to verify  some things with my insurance so I got the lab bill from Enzo almost 9 months (yea....) after the date of service.  I cross referenced it with the bill from Columbia for the same date of service,  which came shortly after the office visit to draw blood (sending out bills is one thing they are not slow about), and noticed that Columbia had billed for the blood collection, as well as for the analysis of 3 hormones, under the same code as Enzo Labs, who actually did the analysis.  I could not believe I had to call Columbia... again.  I thought I was done with them.  Spoke with Sara in billing, who told me that she would call me back in a couple of days to let me know what the credit owed to me was.  I never got a call back, and when I called after a week Sara no longer worked there!  They then transferred to me Sofia Papaderos, the financial services manager, who actually was pretty good about emailing me back at first.  However, I found it strange that the manager could not give me a timeline of when or how the credit would be processed (apparently the credit needs several approval signatures prior to issuance of a refund check, again, something you would expect the manager to know about).  She then proceeded to tell me that an amended claim needed to be filed with the insurance prior to me getting the refund, but Columbia never sent this amended claim, and again, her exact words were ""Not sure on the time frame unfortunately"".  Then I stopped hearing back from her all together!  After over a month of back and forth, I finally somehow just received a refund check in the mail, without needing this so-called amended claim.  </div>]"

I visited the clinic at all hours of the day and this was also the case. The exam rooms are extremely outdated and felt dirty to me. The walls were covered in marks and desperately needed fresh paint. The sterilizing machines would be left on and beeping non-stop for 10+ minutes at a time until someone would finally come in and turn it off. They do not have many lab techs to take blood work. I would estimate 3 techs at a time. The doctor's do not review your chart or paper before entering your exam room.

It takes a month to schedule an appointment (which doesn't last more than 10 minutes) because she is in the office only once a week for half the day.  
You cannot contact your doctor with questions.  Instead, you need to call the office and talk to the nurse.  If you have a question for the doctor then the nurse takes the question and it is supposed to be answered in 24 to 48 hours.  However when I left a message with the nurse - my call was never returned.  If you need immediate response then I think there is a fee for that.

I paid the balance every time I was there and somehow they still managed to send some bills to ""collection"" even though I never got a bill for it.

She originally recommended that we only do 3 before IVF.  I took 100mg of Clomid for days 2-6, with regular monitoring and then insemination after either a positive OPK or ovidrel shot.  The first cycle was a biochemical pregnancy.  Second cycle was negative.  Third cycle resulted in a pregnancy that was ultimately not viable (no fetal heartbeat), followed by a D&amp;C (performed by a different doctor).  Fourth cycle resulted in my son.  We met with her after the miscarriage and she recommended that we continue with IUI because they were clearly working in getting me pregnant, we just needed a viable pregnancy.  She also ordered recurrent pregnancy loss blood tests at that time, all came back normal.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">It really depended on the nurse!  Some were very kind and caring, some were quiet and a little cold.  They were all competant.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">My insurance covered all of my testing and IUIs and D&amp;C, minus co-pays.

The issue with CWRC is that they don't test for everything, and don't communicate what they don't test for. In fact, the issues that were inhibiting our fertility were easily solvable, but during our time with Dr. Rackow and the CWRC, every failure was addressed with statistical charts (eg. You are at ""X"" age, therefore your IVF success % is ""Y""). We were told they had tested for everything. They hadn't. We wasted three years and tens of thousands of dollars at this practice. Ultimately, CWRC are proceduralists.. They are not diagnosticians. When we returned to CWRC after having our child, we recapped the ultimate diagnosis of our fertility challenge and the response we got (from a different doctor there) was simply ""We don't test for that"".

On the other side of the coin were doctors like Dr. Guarnaccia, who was cavalier, did not take into consideration our thoughts on treatment and made us feel like he was doing us a favor.

Cycle 2: 5 days of Clomid starting on CD3, 50mg (lowest dose).  Monitoring via vaginal ultrasound starting around CD10 to monitor follicle growth.  Follicles failed to grow by CD14, so I had several additional monitoring ultrasounds through CD17 when the follicle finally grew to 21mm on right side.    Trigger shot injection given to myself at home once one follicle was large enough.  Provided with directions for timed intercourse after trigger shot.  This cycle resulted in pregnancy.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">My nurse was great about communication via email and on behalf of Dr. Rudick.  She always followed up with me within a few hours of my monitoring appointments to let me know next steps.  She called when topics were more complex or if I had questions.  I never actually made Julissa in person but didn't really mind. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Columbia Fertility is a very busy practice, but they did a great job of keeping appointments close to on time, especially monitoring appointments.  They would typically take me within a few minutes, regardless of if I showed up early or later than my timeslot.  The front desk staff is probably the nicest I have ever experienced at an NYC doctor's office.

Appointments with providers with more prone to delays, but even with those, the most I ever waited was 30 minutes on a particularly bad day.  

Location is fairly central for most people in Manhattan.  I lived in Brooklyn, so it was a hike for me, but very accessible to Columbus Circle subway luckily.

Office is very nice, clean, modern.

The biggest drawback for me was seeing a variety of providers that I didn't know for ultrasounds, and one of the venipuncture staff members was not always the best at hitting the target vein which sometimes results in bruising (most were excellent though!).</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I have a high deductible HSA health insurance plan, and I was seeing Dr. Rudick during the deductible phase of care, so unfortunately for me, all expenses were out of pocket until I hit the deductible.  A typical blood draw/ultrasound appointment ranged between $700-$1000 per visit, and sometimes I had these visits 2-3 per week.  This added up quickly and was a financial burden for us.  We had money saved for this purpose and had planned for the expense, so we were lucky enough to make this work for us.  Overall during the deductible phase I spent $2700 out of pocket for 2 cycles of clomid/trigger shot/timed intercourse.

Once I hit my deductible, I was only responsible for 20% coinsurance, so each visit was between $70-$100.  I became pregnant shortly after hitting the deductible.  For me the price was worth it and I knew my insurance was not great going into the process. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">N/A</div>]"

And when we needed to change our approach, he didn't force it upon us but rather allowed us to come to the decision on our own as this is a very personal process and often times there isn't just one way to proceed.

When that didnt work, I took a cycle off from monitoring but took Clomid to ensure I ovulated and keep things moving forward. Dr. Forman had mentioned injectable meds as a course of treatment but I was resistant and concerned about multiples. After reading a blog of a patient successfully pregnant via injectables, I decided to follow his advice and move ahead with them for the next cycle. And it worked - we were pregnant! I was NOT expecting it and was fully prepared to move on to IVF. Unfortunately, we had a miscarriage - and we were prepared for it as Dr. Forman saw the signs during an early scan. He never gave us false hope but was very pragmatic in managing expectations. We're now onto IVF and retrieval cycles - our first one did not yield as many as expected, but we're learning from it and hoping to have more success this 2nd time around. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Christine is amazing. I started with Tiffany who was equally fantastic, but Christine came on board after working with Dr. Forman for 4 years at a previous practice. If that doesn't speak for itself, what does?

Christine also gave me the best advice - she told me to try and sit back and let the experts manage the process. For a Type A person, it was a lightbulb moment and did in fact result in a positive pregnancy test (followed by a miscarriage).

148,Columbia University,5 Columbus Circle,"New York, NY 10019",8.4,8.3,9,10,35 - 36,2018 - 2019,Yes,3 IVF,Other,—,1 Doc Seen,"[<div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Forman is the best doctor I've had across the board and has elevated my standards for medical care. Never before had I met a doctor who emailed me back (from his direct email, not through some labyrinthine portal system run by a staff person) always within the day, often within the hour, and sometimes within minutes! He made it a priority to do my transfer himself and did two of my three retrievals; for the one retrieval he couldn't do, he called me the night before to go over what to expect and check if I had any questions. When my first retrieval didn't yield the desired results, he spent an hour on the phone with me to review what had happened and discuss protocol shifts. He validated my frustration but also left me feeling hopeful and, sure enough, the next outcome was better. He also was willing to share as much information as my neurotic brain required, including sending me my follicle measurement and hormone level charts, doing side-by-side comparisons of rounds, etc. 

Even after I got pregnant and ""graduated"" out of the IVF clinic, when I reached out with a concern Dr. Forman quickly offered me an appointment and had me in for a blood draw to confirm that all was okay. I ended up doing a CVS to confirm the PGD/PGS testing (the reason we had done IVF), and while I was no longer officially his patient at that point, he still reached out beforehand to wish me luck and later followed up to ask how it went. 

While Dr. Forman is not overly demonstrative and his manner didn't at first strike me as super smiley or warm, he shows his care through his actions and patient outcomes. With a process as emotionally challenging as IVF, he's the doctor you want managing your treatment. I can't recommend him highly enough. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Ask him everything. He is extremely knowledgeable and can give you as many detail as you want but won't overwhelm you with jargon if that's not your speed.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Forman goes above and beyond to answer every question you have, consider all your specific circumstances, and give you as much information as you need. He's very professional and can report results in a straightforward manner, but he also understands what an emotional rollercoaster IVF is and makes himself extremely available for his patients. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">We saw Dr. Forman for IVF with PGD after learning I carried an x-linked disease. He was willing to do a repeat genetic panel to confirm the diagnosis. 

We eventually did three rounds of stimulation drugs:
Round 1 - 150 Follistim and 150 Menopur, then Ganirelix, then 10000 HcG. 
Yield: 14 eggs, 7 mature, 6 fertilized, 2 made it to blastocyst. 
Round 2 - 300 Follistim and 150 Menopur, then Ganirelix, then 5000 HcG and Lupron (dual trigger)
Yield: 15 eggs, 7 mature, 7 fertilized, 6 made it blastocyst.
Round 3 - Estradiol to suppress before starting (because I'd had a leading follicle in between rounds that led us to delay). Same medication regimen as Round 2.
Yield: 25 eggs, 15 mature, 13 fertilized, 7 made it to blastocyst. 

The thinking was that increasing the stim dosage would improve possibly both my egg yield and the number of embryos that made it to day 5. The thinking behind the Lupron was that it might help my egg maturity ratio. Neither was a perfect fix, but the results kept improving overall, so we were pleased. We had to do three rounds because few embryos passed both the PGS and PGD testing, and we wanted to do a transfer with a couple embryos banked.

Before the FET, we did progesterone shots and estrogen pills, and the first one took!</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Wonderful! Jenny did a lot of my blood draws and gave me such comfort during those 7 a.m. needle in the arm appointments (and also never left a bruise). 
Christine and Tiffany did a lot of the communication about medication and appointments and were clear and prompt.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Columbia seems to have made an effort to cut down on wait time. I never had to wait more than 10 minutes--very important when you're trying to squeeze these appointments in before work. 
All the doctors I saw for ultrasounds seemed very kind and knowledgeable. 
The financial coordinator overall was very helpful, but my one complaint is that I sometimes had to email repeatedly to get the information I needed.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">$3K to develop a genetic probe
$3K for PGS/PGD testing of up to 12 embryos

The longer I worked with her the more I liked her.  She continues to have an upbeat outlook even though things did not always go the way we wanted them to, but not so much as to be Pollyanna-ish or falsely optimistic.  She is results oriented and always forward moving - don’t expect her to linger on why something didn’t work or to have an incredibly emotional conversation about your disappointment.  When a result is less than perfect, she’s looking at what to do to optimize that result, or change course to something better/more effective.  
I always felt like she took my questions very seriously and answered them with thought and care, either in person, on the phone, or via email.    </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">When I first met Dr Rudick, I wasn’t 100% sure about her.  I felt like she came off as slightly condescending.  Working with her longer though I realized that it wasn’t really her talking down to us - getting started with fertility treatments, there is an incredible deluge of information thrown at you.  Even if you feel like you’ve done your research and have an idea of how everything works, actually going to the clinic for your consult can be overwhelming.  A year later, I am pregnant and love Dr Rudick’s frank and honest approach of laying out all of the information without sugar coating.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr Rudick was always quick to answer my questions either over the phone or via secure email.  She provided thoughtful responses, and it felt like she always gave me the honest truth, even when it was not what I wanted to hear, in a very informative, but kind manner.  I had a complication with my egg retrieval and Dr Rudick (as well as others at Columbia) followed up with extreme concern and care.  They corresponded with the ER doctors and with my husband and myself several times a day to check in and make sure I was okay.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I did four unsuccessful IUI cycles.  We wanted to start with the least invasive procedures first, especially since I was working a very high stress job which I didn’t want to combine with IVF.  The first two were with Clomid, which I HATED.  The second IUI never even came to fruition, as the Clomid gave me a cyst that prevented doing the actual IUI.  We did the next two with no drugs, despite the fact that she warned us of a very low (1 - 2%) success rate.  This was our choice &amp; she was supportive of it.
After my job ended, we did two rounds of IVF stimulation for frozen transfers.  The first one egg retrieval was a disaster - no one’s fault, but I suffered internal bleeding and ended up in the hospital for three days and needing a blood transfusion.  Internal bleeding is an uncommon side effect, but known risk of egg retrieval listed on the paperwork that you sign before your surgery.  Dr Rudick and the other staff at Columbia were extremely helpful and caring at this time - talking on the phone to my husband and my doctors at the hospital I ended up with to explain and follow up for three days.  They were constantly checking in with me to see how I was doing.  
After all of that, we only ended up getting one PGS tested normal embryo.  Dr Rudick suggested possibly doing another cycle to get more embryos (especially since we hope for another child in the future), as well as specific uterine lining tests if we wanted to move forward with the single good embryo.
We did another round of stimulation, which a slightly different medicine protocol.  This one was a breeze &amp; yielded four PGS normal embryos, two of which were seven-day embryos.     
Dr Rudick was very flexible with timing and encouraged me to do the transfer once another work project had been completed so that I could take it easy surrounding the transfer.  (My work is very intense with long hours &amp; plenty of stress).  
It worked &amp; I am currently 8 weeks pregnant!  I’m on a progesterone suppository until 10 weeks to further support the pregnancy.  We’ve been in for sonograms every weeks for the past three weeks, and are now moving on to a regular midwife practice.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Julissa was lovely and very kind.  She would call or email me with results after every test and had a very clear communication style when it came to the intricacies of the IVF stimulation protocol which is quite complicated and nonsensical for a first timer.  The two nurses who drawl blood were wonderful.  They helped me get over a lifelong fear of needles that I thought would prevent me from doing IVF all-together.    </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Clean, pleasant, and sometimes incredibly crowded in the mornings for monitoring.  The front desk staff are very nice.  The Nordstrom flagship store just opened in the same building, so the surrounding area/getting into the building has gotten a little crazy, but it’s nothing that your average New Yorker can’t handle.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">They sometimes made specific appointments, but  you could also walk in between 7 and 9:30 (if I recall correctly).  The mornings were often very busy, a couple of times were standing room only, but I don’t think I ever waited more than twenty minutes for monitoring, especially if I had an appointment.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">IUI was completely covered by many insurance, IVF was out of pocket.

I would not consider myself an easy patient as I like to understand everything that is going on, ask many questions and the process can be very difficult for me He has never once made me feel rushed or like a number. 

He is thorough, kind, empathetic, charismatic and most importantly extremely good at dictating and adjusting the protocols needed for you to have your baby.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Book in with him as soon as you can. You will not regret it.

Expect that at New Hope the doctors often work as a team effort so know that even if it doesn't seem that you see him often, he is still always reviewing your results and making decisions.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr Merhi ALWAYS has treated me as a human, Remembered details about me and has been completely on top of my care at all times, even when he is not physically in the office.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Many natural cycles (usually producing one eggs)

She's smart and a whip, was very patient, and answered any and every question I asked in our in-person talks.

I had a consultation with her and she seemed cold, robotic, very factual which is fine, answering questions with a smirk (ego type of laugh)…I felt like I was just one more for her. 

It was our 1st meeting &amp; not even 5 minutes in she said “You know….you don’t have to take so many notes…we are the experts, you need to trust”. I explained that I do that anywhere for future reference in case I forget. 
When asking about retrieval &amp; if she would do all my procedures she laughed and said “no there is a group of doctors here &amp; depends who is assigned for it that day. But don’t worry (insert laugh)…’it’s a very easy procedure – anyone can do it” (thought it was very unprofessional &amp; didn’t like fact she thought this was a joke. For someone who’s never done this, it’s a pretty big deal specially the 1st time. She did not give me that comfort security feeling at all. 

On our 2nd meeting (which I scheduled since after 2 months I hadn’t seen her yet since our original consultation), I had a list of questions. 
I felt rushed &amp; was trying to get as much in since I could feel her being annoyed. One of my questions was “why where we doing “mini ivf vs. regular ivf?”. Her response was “because we cant create something out of nothing”…after this I froze, felt shocked &amp; realized no point in asking more questions. I felt like crying. I realized then that she did not care for me. She did not believe she could get me pregnant. I was just one more…one more body. 
I asked what was my ovarian reserve &amp; she said it should be 4-5 follicles per ovary so yours is low even for your age”. I asked my new doctor the same question a month later &amp; he said it was consistent with my age (2-3 total). 
Our 2nd meeting was also when I found out by a nurse I was pregnant but when talking to Dr Lipkin 5 mins later as she explained “well you are ..except you are not”…she had no compassion when telling me, just told me I had a chemical pregnancy and happens to a lot of women. I left the clinic and had to google what a chemical pregnancy was since still wasn’t very clear. 

I had a trigger shot &amp; came next day to confirm retrieval. It turned out I had ovulated so missed the chance. The doctor that came in to explain is the one who became my new doctor (Dr Olcha – did review for him here too). She never called me or emailed me. After 2-3 weeks post that event &amp; not hearing from her plus all reasons above, I decided to switch to Dr Olcha &amp; Im soooooo glad I did. The experience has been night &amp; day. 

Anytime I talked to friends who had gone thru this process they would ask me questions &amp; I could not answer. I had lists of questions for my doctor yet felt like I was just one more, going for blood work &amp; sonogram but no real doctor connection, a doc looking out for me &amp; really watching/customizing my case. 

The clinic is super efficient but her bedside manners are not the best.  A friend of mine who had her wife pregnant there said the same thing…bedside manners are lacking. 
Dr Lipkin – THUMBS DOWN big time. Big disappointment, big waste of time.  
Dr Olcha (separate review) – THE BEST! So happy I made the switch. They are night &amp; day &amp; he is pure LIGHT 
</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">She has no bedside manners, not compassionate. if you care to have someone who has your best interests, actually cares, is compassionate - I would NOT go with her. 
Advice - schedule consultations once a month or whenever you need them since she wont....she relies on nurses to send email with recommendations but not much personal touch/interaction from her side. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Like a # with her.

I had a consultation with her and she seemed cold, robotic, very factual which is fine, answering questions with a smirk (ego type of laugh)…I felt like I was just one more for her. She is not tactful, her answers are short &amp; she wont tell you anything unless you ask. She gives you the minimum (information wise). I

When asking about retrieval &amp; if she would do all my procedures she laughed and said “no there is a group of doctors here &amp; depends who is assigned for it that day. But don’t worry (insert laugh)…’it’s a very easy procedure – anyone can do it really” (thought it was very unprofessional &amp; didn’t like fact she thought this was a joke. For someone who’s never done this, it’s a pretty big deal specially the 1st time. She did not give me that comfort security feeling at all. 

On my consultations with her - I felt rushed &amp; was trying to get as much in since I could feel her being annoyed. It was very clear to me every time I was just a body to her...didnt get the feeling a)she was doing her best for me or b)even believed I could get pregnant. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Nursing staff doesnt have the best bedside manners.

Weakness - nurses bedside manners are lacking. 
Advice - do your research on the doctors &amp; maybe have a consultation with a few to figure out best match for you. I stayed too long with Dr Lipkin. I've understood more &amp; been taken care of more by Dr Olcha than I did with Lipkin. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">trigger shot $100

He came in to explain how they couldn’t do retrieval the next day (what would have been my 1st) since I had ovulated…Orlissa didn’t work for me. He explained to me in 5 mins more than my prior doc at same clinic had explained to me in 2 months with her. He gave me options (clomid to grow rest of follicules vs timed intercourse which he recommended the later). 

I had a consultation with him since I noticed he was an RE &amp; I just kept thinking of how different (good) I felt with him vs my prior doctor. 10 seconds into the meeting I started crying…it was like all my walls came down &amp; I felt safe…I felt I could ask him and I wasn’t being rushed. He said “don’t cry, you are going to make me cry!”…something my prior doc would have NEVER said. I knew right there he saw me as a person, a human, not just another body. He went on to explain the whole process, calm/not rushed, would draw as he explained, talked in simple terms so you can understand. He looked at my prior results &amp; immediately said what needed to be tweaked. 
On my 1st egg retrieval – it ended up being an empty follicule (Cyst). Again he came to give me the bad news (vs sending a nurse). He knew my plan didn’t cover it &amp; it was all out of pocket so he said he would process it thru my medical insurance as a cyst removal and if they covered it, I would get a credit with New Hope. That was the case which was a $1250 relief I could use towards next procedure. This also was my 1st retrieval ever. He kept me so calm, telling me what he was doing as he was doing it. That helped a lot! He said we would grow the remaining ones (lutheal fase &amp; plan of action)
On my 2nd retrieval, I had 2 eggs retrieved, 1 fertilized. It didn’t make it to day 7. He said he would call me but since we had a consultation he figured he explained 1:1. Again he explained everything so clearly going step by step of the process &amp; where my embryo stopped growing. I literally leave his office with so much hope every time since he explains every step &amp; he has a plan of action already. He makes me feel safe &amp; taken care of. 

He works weekends which is great since less people there. When I get monitoring (blood &amp; sonogram) – I usually see him right after looking at my results &amp; getting to plan of action. He sometimes will either come in during or after the monitoring and answer any questions. He is very hands on. My prior doc I was with for 2 months &amp; saw her twice (1st consultation + a meeting scheduled by me). With Dr Olcha I’ve seem him almost every time I’ve been there &amp; If I don’t, I get very detailed emails from his nurse support team with his recommendations.

Im so happy I switched to him. He is the reason I have hope &amp; feel like I can trust the science. That he is looking out for me &amp; doing what is best for me. Its truly customized &amp; making changes as we go &amp; know more. He is night and day from my prior doc &amp; I will recommend him to ANYONE (I already have). He is the best combination of knowledgeable, calm, compassionate, very good at explaining…..he is the PERFECT COMBO OF SCIENCE MEETS HEART!  I feel so lucky God put him on my path. I trust he will get me there
</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Ask him anything. He will explain and you will feel so much better after. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">He actually cares. I feel he is customizing &amp; tweaking everything based on most recent results. he takes time to explain everything &amp; make sure Im at ease &amp; understand everything. When doing my retrieval (my 1st ever) he explained to me every step of the way which kept me so calm. 
I know the difference since my prior doc treated me like a #. Dr Olcha is night and day from her &amp; Im soooo happy I switched to him. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">1st retrieval was a cyst so we grew the remaining follicles. He tweaked the Clomid dosage (from 100mg from prior doc to 50 mg)...not sure if since I was in lutheal phase. Next cycle he might do clomid + injectables (Im doing ""mini ivf"")</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I usually deal with those who draw blood + the sonogram. Nurses usually just email the instructions (after you leave). the ones I have dealt at the clinic, some are very dry/no bedside manners....one told me I was pregnant (instead of letting doc tell me...it was a chemical pregnancy)...i saw her again 2 weeks later &amp; she didnt even remember me (even do she did a big mistake). </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Strength - 
Very efficient. You are in &amp; out in 30-60 mins. I have time to get to work before 9am. Never a long wait
You come in, check in, then look at monitor which tells you chair to draw blood or sonogram room. After you get email with instructions &amp; next steps.

They email the protocol to you with your meds and you say, please call into X pharmacy and they respond ""please email [insert email] regarding prescriptions.""  Seems like we shouldn't be worrying about this and that the calling in of prescriptions should be handled better.  Caused a bit of stress for me bc I had to repeatedly follow up on prescriptions being called in. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The wait time for regular monitoring and sono is pretty short -- they run like a well-oiled machine in this regard.  They also have good hours 7-2, so it doesn't interfere with work too much. I do believe that the lab / embryology dept. there is quite good and the folks working in the lab are top of the game -- you can email them as well with questions and they are responsive.  Herminio (in embryology) is really great and compassionate and helped us through some stressful times. I wish there was more interaction with your primary doctor - -in fact, I didn't even feel like I HAD a primary doctor at all. I sometimes felt like maybe nobody was really focusing on my protocol.  Again, I did have success at New Hope in 2015/2016, and it is more recently that I've grown concerned about the level of care I am receiving. NH could potentially be a one-protocol kind of place -- not sure how customized the treatments are.  The cost at New Hope is also much more reasonable than other places, so that's a plus (assuming of course you are getting the care you need and want). </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Egg retrieval &amp; fertilization (excluding monitoring and drugs) ran around $4500 (with anesthesia).  This was pretty reasonable comparatively.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Merhi transferred 2 normals for me -- ended up with one baby. </div>]"

It’s important for me to feel comfortable with people in the clinic and it’s important for me to feel comfortable with doctors. All that I had just said described Dr. Zhang and his clinic. He listens to our frustration and how much impact it’s carrying us and also financially. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">To always trust your gut feeling. Listen and ask millions of questions. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">From all other fertility clinics we’ve been to, New Hope was friendly. Dr. Zhang and staff were friendly and organized. They saw me as a human being not an object of someone just coming in for treatments. They understand our frustration and our pain. We’ve also endured two stillbirths. They know the pain and heartache of losing two precious babies and trying again and not working. Dr. Zhang is there to questions that’s needing answers. He is always available to talk to without paying...he understands!</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I was preparing for retrieval’s of my own eggs (one or two he sees), he uses minimal meds. Trigger shots when it’s time for retrieval in two days , I don’t remember the meds I had taken. 

For preparing egg donor transfers, I have been taking estradiol, promethium....depends on my blood work result if it needs some adjusting I had taken prednisone, progesterone shot on my butt, baby aspirin, enoxaparin injection on my stomach. Sometimes my lining needs to be thicker so they up my use to progesterone sometimes. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">We started seeing Dr. Zhang back in 2016 and we are still doing that:) the staff are wonderful. When I come in they know me and don’t need to tell them my name. They input it on their computer and they know I’ve already arrived. During blood work monitoring, they know I have thin veins and they are careful. Nurse are available to talk to and few I’ve met and talked to. They are super nice, cordial and you ask them anything even if it’s embarrassing or disgusting. The sonographers I absolutely love. They know our loses and they are so sweet. They talk to me about how I’m doing and how my day is going. They always try to lift my spirits. Other doctors on site are fantastic. They are friendly and you can ask them anything and they are there to help you. Nurse after my transfers, super sweet. You feel comfortable and they don’t rush you to get up and leave. The staff during transfers, they give me instructions what to do and they are caring too. The embryologist I meet during transfers, super nice and friendly. They show me my embryo on the screen and they really check to make sure it is me and I understand exacting what is going on. Doctors who performs the transfers are friendly and I can ask anything even though he is busy doing what he needs to do. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The clinic is amazing. There are more patients than ever. The clinic’s atmosphere is friendly and open. The only weakness I have to say is to really be a bit more organize on some areas. For example, I had done bloodworks already and they kept asking me for particular blood work reports which I had given. They’ve asked me Numerous times and I keep being copies for them. Whoever scans the documents, they need scan better and put it in my file. At one time only, a nurse emailed me my blood work result and protocol. The meds she told me was to take clomid. But that’s for retrieval. I was doing transfers. So one nurse emailed me and corrected it. Also, I keep getting ask if I’m
Allergic to medications. I did tell them so many times yes and gave them the name and still keeps asking me. It’s ok. I learn to answer each time:)</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">My monitoring experience is great. The ladies who gets my blood has no problem. Although I have small veins, they still manage to get it done. They always ask me if I’m doing ok. 

As for sonogram, I love the ladies there. So respectful. I get along well with them. They know how hard and how long and our loses. They’ve become my friends there. Always smiling. :) which I love. Makes my day. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">We’ve been doing fertility for 9 and half long years. My husband and I have seen numerous doctors. 

The billing at the Dr. Zhang’s office is very organized. There’s always three there. They know your name and what needs to be paid. They even tell you what it’s for and if the insurance paid or not and explained why. They even have online service to pay online now too. They are friendly. 

My husband and I pay out of pocket fertility for nine and half long years. For donor eggs we have $13,200 for 6 eggs. Then they tell us how survived. For example, embryologist will email and tell me they get 5 out of 6 ready to be sent out for genetic testing. Before sending we have to pay $750 per embryo to be tested first before being sent out. Ones we do that we have 7-10 days to wait and they will email with results. Then they will email again and tell us how many survived and how many healthy with grades on them and explanation of their grades. 

So imagine having failed donor eggs many many times $13,200 x 5 times. We are financially medically in debt. We need help! </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">When we did our transfer in Cancun Mexico, the doctor there transferred four embryos all the time. Out of three cycles, I was pregnant but resulted in 10 week miscarriage.

IUI was unsuccessful and I wasn’t thrilled that the Merhi’s clinic kept me waiting, delayed in the reception area bc of some administrative error. I made a written comment but did not receive a reply. Now, I’ve moved on to create one embryo and one mosaic embryo.

Although you can request to see him sometimes and you can pay another fee to get follow up consultations. I really do not know how good he is because he does not explain why he is doing things in this way instead of that way so I can't evaluate the why of what he does or evaluate his thinking skills. I am a person who likes to understand the reasons that decisions are being made so this is not the best style for me. But I'm not sure that any ivf doctors really explain much about their decisions to the patients. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">This is a busy clinic. It can be frustrating sometimes as a patient because you can feel like a widget on an assembly line. On the other hand, there are some ways that they automatically personalize the service in ways that other clinics do not. For example, you get to decide for yourself whether you want to use sedation for egg retrieval or not. I prefer not, which saves us $500 each time. I also do not like sedation so I am happy I can choose not to use it. Most ivf clinics will not allow you this choice. I have inquired at many clinics and 99% force you to use sedation even if you are only retrieving one to three eggs. I do not think that is a reasonable approach and I think it is disrespectful to the patient to take away their right to make medical decisions about things that are not truly a necessary part of a procedure. I think allowing the patient this choice is part of the general approach of respecting the patient so this is one of the things I love about New Hope.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">This is a very busy clinic, which allows them to keep their costs low. They are much cheaper than any other clinic I have contacted in America and I have called many.

The nurses are hit or miss. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I mostly did natural cycles with mini or ultra mini ivf a couple times. This is because I am at an age where I don't have many eggs to conventional just would not do anything beneficial for me and would have some negatives. We have two five day blasts frozen. We did not pgs test them so we do not know if they are aneuploidy. We were told that at my age, the likelihood is that they will not have normal chromosomes. The clinic let us decide whether to test them and did not pressure us either way. We are trying to collect and freeze several five day blastocysts while we can and implant later.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The nursing staff seems very busy. Some of them are nice but a couple are uncaring and downright rude; these ones may not have much empathy for the amount of money the patients are spending or the mental stress of being infertile. In our case, we have spent all of our savings and then had to stop making attempts and then saved again for almost a year to try again because for us it will be a numbers game. The doctors said that my fertility is unusually good for my age but our chances of a baby are better if we can freeze several embryos. We will never regret using all our savings for this and all future savings. However, it is a big sacrifice and it is an all day round trip drive for us every time we go there. I also suffer from extreme motion sickness so when we arrive at the clinic, I am always feeling very ill. Everything about undergoing ivf on a budget is extremely difficult. The doctors seem to understand this but some of the nurses often seem to lack the maturity to understand what the patients are experiencing.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">This clinic is open seven days a week for monitoring, which is great. Unfortunately they only do egg retrievals before about 11:30 so that means doing a natural retrieval is impossible and you have to use a trigger. I think this is common for most clinics. At least they are open seven days a week. Many clinics close on Saturdays and/or Sundays. As I mentioned, they allow you to do retrievals without sedation if you want, which also saves you $500 and in my opinion is healthier for your brain. They have an in house lab for the standard monitoring bloodwork. They get good prices on outside lab work. Monitoring is much cheaper there than at other clinics I have researched. I don't like the smell they pump in to the clinic. We call it the New Hope smell and our clothes/coats/hair reek of it after being there. We are both very smell sensitive so we wish they would not use any fragrances in the clinic. I have not done any cycles at other clinics so I do not know what the differences are in how much individual attention you get. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Monitoring is very efficient. You go when you can get there and the wait is usually not that long.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">It depends on what you do. It is much cheaper than most clinics if you are paying for your own cycles. We have never had insurance which covers ivf so I have no idea how that would work.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">It seems that the doctor and clinic overall prefer to implant one embryo because they feel this gives the overall highest chance for success.

Never was there a change discussed after any cycle or summary/thoughts, unless I asked to do something different.  The office is very streamlined, and efficient, so much so, there is a lack of personal interaction.  Also, I had had a bad experience with the staff from my first clinic, without any thoughts to my feelings a doctor that treated me from that clinic should up at an egg retrieval at this clinic, since this procedure is timed, I felt I had no choice but to allow him to do the retrieval.  I almost did not go back for the next cycle I was so distraught.    </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Because I had had several cysts with my first doctor, I sought NHF because of there mini-IVF protocols for patients with PCOS.  I did 3 late luteal phase mini-ivf cycles using letrozole, clomid, and gonal-f, with lupron after the first retrieval to allow for a second retrieval in one cycle.

The cost for mini-ivf is great if you have the time to go slow, (ie younger patients).  
The weakness is the lack of contact with any direct person, you are talking to various nurses, doctors, and admin-financial staff.  At one point my payment was put on someone else's account, although I had just handed them my credit card with my name on it.  I also had to fight to get balances removed for treatment that was not performed.

For example, I did not have an AMH test, which would have helped me decide whether to proceed to IVF using my own eggs. I was also advised to do an egg retrieval (for $4,000) for just one egg. When I asked questions about both of these things I was given either no answer or confusing information that left me feeling like I was worrying for no reason because this was how fertility treatment worked. When I switched to a different clinic I was advised that an egg retrieval for less than 6 eggs is not worthwhile.

4) No anesthesiologist checked on me to ask about allergies or medical conditions. When it was my turn, they were running far behind schedule and they acted very rushed. It did not sound like they were going to be careful.
5) Dr Zhang was not the attending physician during egg retrieval. It was someone else. Dr Zhang never told me that it would be another doctor. I never saw Dr Zhang. This was a shock to me. I had never met this other doctor before, and he never introduced himself to me. He just asked me how many follicles I had and if I had IVF before. That was all. He never bothered to read my patient history. 
6) No doctor came to talk to me after the retrieval. No one else told me what happened. I was told that I can go home. They never checked if there was someone to drive me home. They never gave me any water or food. That was a horrific experience.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">He prescribed minimal stimulation IVF. I started on birth control pills: two pills a day for 2 days, then 1 pill a day for 3 days, then half a pill a day for 3 days. Seven days later, I started clomid: 50 mg/day for 5 days then 25  mg/day for 4 days. At the same time I started clomid, I took letrazole 2.5 mg/day for 6 days. One day after starting clomid and letrazole, I started follistim: 75 IU/day for 7 days. One the last day of follistim, I injected half a syringe of ganirelix. The trigger was 10 IU lupron and 150 IU ovidrel.

The rational for the procedure was not explained, other than to say that this is the minimal stimulation protocol. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The ultrasound and blood work were okay. The problem is that I was contacted by a different nurse every time when the communicated the ultrasound and egg retrieval results. One nurse did not write English well. It was hard to understand. 

During the egg retrieval day, there were no nurses to take care of patients. She just put on my patient bracelet and left me to wait for my procedure. They did not take my vital signs. No one took my blood pressure.  Afterwards they did not give me any water or food. They just told me to leave. They did not ask if I came alone or if there was anyone to drive me home. There was minimal communication and it was all impersonal.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Scheduling time with Dr Zhang is hit and miss. Sometimes you get to see him soon, other times it is a long wait of up to 2.5 hours.

The clinic is new and clean.  Utrasound and bloodwork is efficient and the wait time is short.

The problem is on egg retrieval day. It was the most horrific experience of my life. The assistant checking me in told me not to be scared about what I see in the waiting room. When I entered the waiting room, I saw the same room doubled as recovery and waiting rooms. There were no beds. A patient was sleeping on a sofa, recovering from her retrieval. Another woman was left to walk out of the room on her own with no help. She did not have anesthesia. Another woman was in so much pain, she had to be wheeled out in a rolling bed. It was so busy that I had to wait in the recovery area as patients came out of their retrieval. I saw patients coming out like this one after another and I can see every one was not feeling well. There was no privacy. I could see and hear the nurse telling every one about their retrieval results. I had to wait two hours for my turn. I was very upset and scared, sitting there watching all of this happening. I was just told to take everything off from the waist down. In two other IVF clinics I attended, you took all your clothes off under the gown. Here, they just wanted you to drop your pants for a quick retrieval. It was a rushed factory. No anesthesiologist checked on me to ask about allergies or medical conditions. When it was my turn, they were running far behind schedule and they acted very rushed. It did not sound like they were going to be careful. Dr Zhang was not the attending physician. It was someone else. Dr Zhang never told me that it would be another doctor. I never saw Dr Zhang. This was a shock to me. I had never met this other doctor before, and he never introduced himself to me. He just asked me how many follicles I had and if I had IVF before. That was all. He never bothered to read my patient history. He started working on me before the anesthesia took effect. I had to tell them to wait. They never put any blood pressure cuff on me. The room was dark. The operating room in two other IVF clinics I attended were brightly lit. How can they see in the dark? There were no nurses in the operating room. In other IVF clinics I attended, there was a whole team of people helping with egg retrieval. This made me worried about my treatment. Everything felt careless and dangerous.

When I woke up, the nurse told me they could only retrieve 4 eggs. She also told me 2 of those 4 eggs were broken. I was devastated to hear this. No doctor came to talk to me. No one else told me what happened. I was told that I can go. They never checked if there was someone to drive me home. They never gave me any water or food. That was a horrific experience. It was traumatic to hear that they broke my eggs and then they just asked me to leave. Afterwards, I could not find any information anywhere about how eggs can be broken. I emailed the nurse to ask. She told me that this can happen when they use high pressure to aspirate the eggs. I contacted other clinics to find out if this can happen and they told me that they have never heard of eggs breaking. I scheduled an appointment to see Dr. Zhang. He explained that it might be the fault of the doctor or maybe they retrieved my eggs at the wrong time.
After the anesthesia, I felt nausea and dizziness. I never felt like this when I recovered from other procedures under anesthesia. I also had pain and inflammation for 1 week after the procedure. I never felt this bad with the other two retrievals I had in other clinics. It felt like they were not careful with the anesthesia and they were so rough during retrieval that there was probably scarring and that was how my eggs were broken. Since I don't have many eggs, every egg counts. I was devastated to hear that they broke 2 of my eggs. That IVF cycle was not a success. I will always wonder if those 2 eggs were not broken because of New Hope's carelessness, I would have had a successful procedure. I would not recommend anyone to go here. If this happened to you, you will always be left wondering if your broken eggs was a lost opportunity. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Monitoring was no problem. It was efficient and the wait time was short.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I did not get any bills yet, except the anesthesia bill for $500. I think the rest might be coming later. I also had to pay for the lupron trigger: $10 or $25 in cash, I don't remember. This was a lot of money for 10 IU in a syringe that they filled, considering that an entire 2.8 mL vial  of luprion is $10 co-pay, which I know from my other IVF procedure.</div>]"

Nice but you can tell he deals with a lot of people and probably comes off a bit harsh to some more sensitive or insecure types. I liked him. He appreciated my sense of humor and would laugh - loudly and sharply and then I would laugh because he laugh was so direct and funny. Honestly, he's not soft or snuggly type - but he means well, he's got a good setup, he's got a good idea of what to do, and he's willing to try something different that fits. He's a bit of an out of the box thinker and I liked it. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I would say - just relax and ask questions. If he seems hurried or distracted (because he does have a lot of patience) it's OK. He'll take the time. Also, don't expect one doctor to solve all your problems, this is something you need to take control of yourself and get educated. What you want is a good treatment and good caring team. He's got so many ways to get you want you need, tell him your concerns and listen to him. I did seriously the most non-aggressive treatment and it worked for me. He listened to my problems with hormones and the fact I don't take the pill because of it and didn't make me do the intense treatment. That was MY choice and he went with it and gave me options. It may not be an option for everyone, but I met with 5 other doctors and he was the ONLY one willing to think out of the box and offer different cycle treatments. I love how he puts focus on one good egg, not a bunch of bad ones... that is all that matters in the end. One good egg can come from just three oocytes. Remember that. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Well, while some people didn't like how the clinic was set up (very structured) I found it calming. I always knew where I was in the process, everything was on site so there was no waiting for blood results, the nurses were freaking awesome and always used butterfly tiny needles to make it less painful, the women were always nice. The only drawback was sometimes I couldn't get through to the financial people. I mean, it's a clinic - not a hotel... but it went above my expectations with one disappointment when I told the Dr not to put me on the pill (hormones) and he did AND it was the only cycle that didn't work at all. Had they listened to me, the patient I could have had more eggs. It was stressful and it's hard and the waiting is not easy, but it is what it is. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I can't remember the dosage, but I took Clomid and did a trigger shot and that was it. What I loved is he followed my natural cycle and we didn't force anything. We would take my blood about 10 times a month to follow my cycle and after the first time, we learned what it was fairly easy. By the 4th retrieval, it was easy. The goal was to do multiple retrievals instead of one big one with lots of eggs and stay with my natural cycle.  I could have probably done a few more, but I stopped at 4 due to cost. 

The Clomid made it so I had some extra unfertilized eggs under my natural cycle, as my blood tests came back and I got closer to the ovulation date he would set a date and I'd do a trigger shot the night before and go in for retrieval at a specific time the next day.  

I got 3 unfertilized eggs each treatment, for a total of 12, only 3 of the twelve made it to DAY 5 and then we had genetic testing and of the 3, ONE was good. And we now have a really beautiful, super healthy boy. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The nurses varied from day to day, but all of them were nice and helpful. Some got me in on days that were difficult. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Strength: is the variety of options for different people. It's not a one size fits all solution.  The fact everything you need for the procedure is ON SITE is really a profound difference from other clinics I visited. Everyone understood what needed to be done and while it wasn't perfect, there was a structure and if you can deal with that then you'll be fine. 

Weakness: poor financial coordination and communication that end. It was always hard to understand what I needed or if a payment wasn't made or when it wasn't made - what to do to help it go faster once paid. I got a feeling the ladies in the department were overwhelmed. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I barely remember this now... but I think it was $18K total for all 4 retrievals and the transfer And then an additional for the genetic tests... $2500? </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">He preferred one good egg for me, but I don't know what he preferred for others.

Only once was he not there and so his team scheduled a phone consult appt with him and he called the very next day. I specifically requested him to be the Dr. to perform my last/most recent IVF transfer with donor egg and sperm, and he made sure to schedule me with respect to his availability. He left no stone unturned to give me all the meds, scheduled appt.'s, consults, etc., to make sure we succeeded this time! I feel he took no issue with my age (47) and was 100% on my team with absolute assuredness we would succeed. If I had any questions, he would slowly spell everything out for me in a respectful way...even drawing pictures/charts for me in his office. We did succeed and he was genuinely SO happy for me!</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Ask in the beginning what days Dr. Merhi is at the office location you prefer. He goes to two (I think) different locations every week. Be bold with requesting exactly what you need and ask every question you have! Make sure you ask to specifically meet with him. When you do monitoring during their daily hours (7am-12pm), I would get there on the earlier side if you hope to catch Dr. Merhi after your meetings with bloodwork/sonograms. It helps if you do your own research and have specific questions for him re: your own protocol and needs.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">With Dr. Merhi, I felt listened to and respected. I felt he took the time (never rushing) with me to help me really understand every step. He helped me feel like no question was too ""dumb"" and he was very positive and encouraging. I read folks' energy very well and he was very sincere with me. He was not in it for the money and taking me for a ride. I felt supported and nurtured.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I started at New Hope FC in 2016! I met with whomever whenever they were available as I had no idea what I was doing nor what to expect. For a while, I felt I was just a number and on an assembly line. That is, until I met with Dr. Merhi. I started in 2016 with mini-IVF protocol. The plan was to use my own eggs w/ donor sperm. I'll skip the methods used by some of the Dr.'s &amp; go right to Merhi. The meds used for cycles, etc., were pretty much the same w/ all Dr.'s I was using along the way. However, with Dr. Merhi, I began to feel supported and listened to. I began to realize I that if I brought more to the table (the right questions, etc.), he took the time with me, too, to explain things more clearly. When it came the for the egg retrievals, it was ONLY Dr. Merhi's that I felt ZERO pain. The other Dr.'s techniques, etc., I had a lot of pain during the procedures - no joke. After all the cycle efforts using my own eggs (always MY decision to make), I am the one who came to the hard realization that perhaps my eggs weren't viable. I took a break (mid-2017 to Fall 2019). When I returned to my efforts, I came in already knowing I was going to use a donor for eggs (&amp; donor sperm). I only requested Dr. Merhi (after prior experiences w/ other Dr.'s there). Full disclosure: after the time away, new Dr.'s were there as well. I have NO idea how some of them are. I can only attest to my comparison of Dr. Merhi with about 4 others there. I ONLY worked with Dr. Merhi this time around. And - to GREAT SUCCESS!! I am pregnant...1st trimester almost over. :-)</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">It took many, many visits to realize who my favorites were, honestly. Some of the blood drawers weren't great (read: painful needle insertion!), and others - I felt nothing! Some of the sonogram technicians (NOT nurses) liked to pretend they really new a lot about medical needs/advice - which was not great for a ""newbie"" like me in the beginning of my journey. Make sure you are talking to a NURSE when you have questions. Also - if you get the feeling the nurse does not know the answer, ASK for a meeting with Dr. Merhi! Also- Dr. Merhi has a specific nurse team! Ask for the Merhi-Nurse Team email for emails communications (merhisupport@...). I definitely had my favorite nurses there. Sometimes, the nurses' lines re: my specific protocol were crossed and I had to confirm something 2 or 3 times with DIFFERENT nurses before getting Dr. Merhi's actual correct answer. This was mostly through several email exchanges and strategically CC'ing different nurses. Never apologize for needing an answer if you feel you're not getting what you need. Call! Email! Again, some nurses are way more experienced and clearly-spoken than others. You'll start to realize as you go along. Never hesitate to ask for a meeting with Dr. Merhi if you really need.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">You can feel assured that the Dr.'s at this clinic all know the latest techniques and strategies for protocol for each person's needs. There's a chance you'll feel a bit like you are on an assembly line at first. I can't stress enough - make your voice heard! Ask questions, and if someone doesn't know the answer, make a consult appt. with your chosen Dr. there. In my case, I chose Dr. Merhi - hands down. Sometimes - the billing dept. can be a bit cold and treat you like a number. I recommend taking care of billing stuff before the day of a major procedure (IUI, egg retrieval, IVF transfer, hysteroscopy, etc.). It can be a bit unnerving to deal with billing dept. the day of those emotional procedures. If your name comes up to visit billing - hopefully it's not on a major procedure day. If you know you need to pay for something and a major procedure is coming, just be proactive about taking care of it early. They WILL call you in on a procedure day and make you pay before the retrieval/transfer. Feels a bit cold, I must say. But - it's not free after all. Just recommending you take care of it before the DAY OF. It really helps if you read their website re: all the different levels of IVF, etc., and then make your list of questions going in for the very first consultation with a Dr. of your choice. If you need to, meet with 3 or 4 different Dr.'s in the beginning to see who you gel with.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Monitoring hours are very convenient! It is a well-oiled machine. Hours are 7am-12noon. The sooner you arrive, the less time you'll wait. The longest I've waited was about 30 minutes. That was only because I went in closer to 11-12pm time. They are a well-oiled machine. Once you arrive and check-in, you're in line in the order you came.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The billing dept. is VERY good/trustworthy at trying to submit everything to your insurance first. Depending on what your coverage is, the costs of all procedures, monitoring, etc., are comparable to most places. They are reasonable in relation to other places, depending on what you're having done. Not going to lie -- it's EXPENSIVE. But - I feel we're a special case: in the end, after several efforts using my own eggs w/ IUI donor sperm and IVF, we chose to also go with an egg donor. I mean - I could have put this child (the one I'm pregnant with as I type!) through its first two years of college! Some of the meds were covered by my insurance - not all of them. Some of the procedures were covered by insurance - not all of them.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I never talked about this with Dr. Merhi because my wife and I agreed that we'd only ever opt to have ONE embryo transferred at a time. We did not want to risk multiples. It was not ever a topic for Dr. Merhi and I.</div>]"
233,New Hope Fertility Center,4 Columbus Circle,"New York, NY 10019",6.9,6.9,10,10,36,2019,Yes,2 IVF,Tubal Blockage,$100K - $199K,1 Doc Seen,"[<div class=""review-question__response"">We initially began the IVF journey at the New Hope clinic with another doctor. However, my OBGYN doctor had recommended Dr. Merhi, and I had felt put off by some of the communication with the other doctor, so we decided to switch to Dr. Merhi. I am so grateful that we did. Along our journey, there were definitely unexpected twists and turns -- a smaller number of eggs than expected reacting to the stimulation medication, a need for me to have a hysteroscopy done, uterine lining not thickening up to the desired level by the scheduled date. While we had direct consultations with Dr. Merhi at only some of these junctures, with every one of these ""setbacks"", Dr. Merhi implemented some kind of solution-oriented strategy to try to obtain a better outcome. Sometimes this meant just continuing medication and waiting a few days for the situation to change, and in other times it was really about building the best possible conditions for a successful transfer. I knew that he was personally checking my charts after every monitoring session I had, so I felt personally cared for. 

I am a firm believer in doing my own research and making sure that as a patient, I always advocate for myself. I also knew that I could express my worries or doubts to Dr. Merhi and his responses were always honest, but comforting. Is the IVF science perfected for pregnancy to be guaranteed each time? Of course not. But having a doctor who is truly your cheerleader and doing their best to strategize the best scientific road to success is crucial.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Merhi is busy, busy, busy. There is always a line out the door of patients out the door to see him. If you choose to be treated by Dr. Merhi, I would suggest:

- Communicate! Be open about what are your concerns are with your cycle.

- Do your own research and always advocate for yourself! Prepare your own questions so you can best make use of the time at the in-person consultations.

- Don't be discouraged if you can't always see him in person. We would occasionally see other doctors for consultations just for questions or concerns, if we couldn't see him.
</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Speaking directly with Dr. Merhi always felt very personal -- he is honest, but also has excellent bedside manners, which I believe is super important during the entire stressful IVF process (especially since I found myself very sensitive every step of the way!). Dr. Merhi is one of the most in-demand doctors at the clinic, which means you'll always have to wait a while to consult with him and he doesn't have a lot of time. However, my husband and I ALWAYS felt that we were respected and treated well by Dr. Merhi. It always felt worth the wait just to be reassured by him, and to really feel that he was (is) genuinely determined to help us obtain success in our IVF journey.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">During the retrieval cycles, we used birth control pills, letrozole and Clomid pills, as well as Gonal-F and Cetrotide injections. My second cycle (which was when we had switched to Dr. Merhi) produced better results than the first cycle (with another doctor). I actually asked to be placed on a higher medication dose because I felt that the dosage in the first cycle wasn't stimulating enough follicles -- Dr. Merhi prescribed a higher dose of the Gonal-F and added in some of the other pills, and we were able to retrieve more eggs and create more embryos the second time around.

Regarding transfer, I had one failed FET and one successful FET. Leading up to the first FET, I was taking Prometrium (progesterone). After the first failure, Dr. Merhi expanded the medication protocol to include Progesterone in oil injections, a small dosage of Prednisone and baby aspirin. I believe that these medications helped my body to be more prepared to successfully accept the second FET.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">You'll see the nurses for your regular monitoring -- drawing blood and sonograms. The nurses are often rotating so on occasion I would see a few nurses that I recognized and had grown friendly with. Some nurses are not as friendly -- some are colder and just trying to ""get it done"". However, this made me appreciate more the few nurses/sonographers who were just more sensitive to my situation, taking care to look carefully at the results, and to answer my questions. One definitely develops preferences for some of the nurses over others. I am extremely grateful to one sonographer who managed to carefully inspect my results and discovered that I would need to have a hysteroscopy to remove a growth before the FET.

</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Strengths: 
- More friendly pricing (we found it cheaper than other clinics)
- Flexible monitoring windows that can accommodate different schedules
- Convenient location at Columbus Circle, emailing instructions (instead of calling -- really awkward to take those calls in public!).

Weaknesses:
- You won't see your doctor each time you come in to monitor (unless you wait after monitoring) as you are monitored by the nurses
- No one explains what to expect for normal procedures prior to that day (ie I wanted to know exactly what to expect on egg retrieval day or transfer day) so if you're interested in knowing beforehand, make sure you schedule a consultation to ask a staff member directly what to expect.
- Sometimes we would be waiting for a consultation with the doctor, and the doctor's nurse support staff (not the monitoring nurses) would try to field our questions instead of letting us see the doctor directly... when this happened, we often felt really dissatisfied with the nurses' answers -- and often they were not consistent with the doctor's answers! Again, my advice is to always advocate for yourself, and insist on seeing the doctor even if the nurses are trying to get you out the door. If you advocate for yourself, then I believe you will have a good experience. 

Notes:
The clinic is, as are many of the doctors, busy busy busy. You can be a human, or you can be just a number. I think that part of it really depends on how you advocate for yourself. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">It's a pretty efficient monitoring system. Most of the time I was able to be in and out (bloodwork and sonogram) within 20-40 minutes. 

Once in a while, the wait was so long and I had to check in with the front desk again to make sure they didn't forget about me. Make sure to not be afraid to check in again if you feel that you've been waiting longer than 30 minutes for bloodwork. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">We paid out of pocket for costs as our insurance would not cover any of it. Costs, with medication, ran around $10,000 - $12,000 per retrieval cycle. The FET is around $3000.

It helped to get medication for a pharmacy recommended to me by a friend (Medcal Pharmacy), which had a special discount with patients from New Hope and also delivered the medications straight to my door, free of charge.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I was told that it was safer for a woman at my age to transfer one embryo. Personally, my husband and I weren't interested in transferring more than that at one time, so we were already on board with Dr. Merhi's approach to eSET.</div>]"

He caught and diagnosed what was missed twice, by another very reputable IVF clinic.  It was confirmed during surgery and he corrected the problem.

He may not always be available as most doctors cannot be, but his staff is great at getting back to you. He does call and reach out which was great, as our previous doctor  didn't typically do that.    We felt he was also on point with all the new technology, studies, standards of practice etc and did not subscribe to anything that was not proven or did not have statistical significance.   </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Merhi was very kind, easy to speak with and made himself available when we had a question last minute on the day of the transfer.

It is very fast paced, technologically advanced, and reminds me of the military in the respect that they have everything down to a science. Most communication occurs via email.  Additionally, New Hope was fairly priced and more reasonable than other clinics (which we GREATLY appreciated) and offered more advanced care.  It can feel slightly cold or isolating, however, we didn't mind as we weren't there for the experience.  We were there for results.  And that is what we got!</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The costs for self pay were more reasonable and fair than other clinics in other states.  Also, I was delighted that we did not have to pay for everything up front all at once as we had to do at another clinic.

She is by far the best doctor I have ever been to. There are a few things that really stand out:

I always felt like Dr. DeVore cared about me personally -- she respected my personal values and my comfort zone, and she made recommendations that were tailored specifically to me. 

She is compassionate but also fully candid and honest. She never sugar coated any of the facts, and just as importantly, gave me ALL the information that I needed to feel comfortable about the decisions that we were making. She is extremely thorough in her analysis and detail oriented. I felt empowered and fully understood the process and next steps. After every appointment, I would walk out of the room, feeling like we made the right decisions. Not everything we tried worked out in the beginning, but the decision-making process and information was so clear and upfront, that we were able to pivot as needed. The entire IUI/IVF process can be extremely complicated, so this piece was HUGE.

Dr. DeVore always went the extra mile. In December, Dr. DeVore let me know that in Jan 2020, there'd be a new law which meant that some New York companies would need to provide full coverage for IVF treatment. Dr. DeVore did extra research on this, guided me through the process, and even helped me follow up with billing (and insurance) to make sure we had the information needed. She even wrote a personal letter to our insurance company to ensure everything was organized and in order before starting IVF. This was HUGE and such a stress relief as the process can typically feel very overwhelming given the potential costs. 

I really felt like Dr. DeVore cared. I know she has a busy schedule and tons of patients, but you would never know. Dr. DeVore gave her FULL attention and dedication to me at every appointment. Even if I had questions outside of appointments, she would get back to me right away too! I've never experienced that level of personal care and can't thank her enough!

</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">If you're going to see Dr. DeVore, you made the right choice! Best doctor at NYU </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Shannon DeVore made me feel so comfortable throughout the process. I always felt like she listened to me and understood my personal needs. Her recommendations were specific to my personal medical situation as well as my needs and life. She was caring and compassionate every step of the way. She took the time needed to answer all my questions and never rushed through. And, she was extremely thorough with her answers. I wanted to understand EVERY step of the process, every risk, and every potential scenario. Shannon was so patient and not only answered my questions immediately, but also gave me the level of depth that I needed so that I felt fully comfortable. I cannot tell you how much I appreciated Dr. DeVore's care, dedication and personal attention! </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">One of my biggest issues was the timing of ovulation as my cycles varied widely month by month. We started out by monitoring my cycles and doing a trigger shot. The first cycle, we learned that my follicles were not growing big enough by the time I ovulated, so for the next cycle, Shannon gave me Clomid to help with the follicle process. Although my body reacted well to Clomid, the first IUI was unsuccessful. The next month, I tried Clomid again but this time my body had a strange reaction to the medication and I had really bad cramps post ovulation. As a result, Shannon decided to pivot and put me on Letrazole instead. I really appreciated this pivot because I knew that Shannon was listening to me and not pushing me down a path (Clomid) that I wasn't comfortable with. In addition, that next month was Christmas and I already had plans to travel and see my family. She knew this was important to me so rather than doing a timed IUI (and having me cancel my plans), I took Letrazole and had sex normally (using ovulation sticks). When this didn't work, the next month, she suggested we try Letrazole + IUI again and simultaneously prepare to start IVF. She was extra careful and thoughtful about monitoring me during this time as she knew my ovulation could be pretty erratic. 4-5 days after my period, she had me come in for morning monitoring and found out I was surging. She told me right away, and then cleared her calendar so that we could do the IUI that afternoon instead of waiting another day. I probably talked to her 3 times on the phone that day to make the decision to do IUI right then -- and I'm so grateful I did!

At the same time, we were also preparing to potentially start IVF. Shannon spent so much time walking us through the process, explaining the medications, and the most cost effective solutions. She mapped out every step and scenario (we had so many questions!!). And then... in a crazy turn of events, the DAY BEFORE we were supposed to start IVF, I found out that I was pregnant! While we never went down the IVF path, I would have felt 100% comfortable if we did. 

In the first 7 weeks of pregnancy, she monitored me to ensure everything was going smoothly and even was there to show me the first heart beat! 




</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The NYU staff was very thorough an organized about calling me with results immediately, booking me for follow up appointments, ensuring our billing was sorted and organizing our insurance paperwork. It was never a problem to get in quickly for morning monitoring (I never waited over 5-10 min). And, they nurses were always friendly --- i felt like we knew each other after 6 months! In addition, we took a 3 hour, in-person course on IVF. I was kicking and screaming going into it because it meant I needed to miss a couple hours of work... but wow, it is so necessary. I highly recommend that everyone take this course before going down the IVF path</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">At NYU, the staff is very organized and thorough. Billing and insurance with NYU was a breeze (and honestly, it's always been a painpoint for me at other clinics). I felt that the facilities were clean, very well managed, and they ran a really tight operation. I would recommend booking your actual appointments well in advance so that you are organized and can plan accordingly. Secondly, I would recommend going to morning monitoring by 8am as it'll take 2-5 min to get in. At around 8:30 or 9am, it can take 15 - 20 min (which isn't bad, but it's helpful to plan). Lastly, I would do your homework on insurance! NYU is really good about making sure you have the information needed so make sure you listen/learn and follow up so that there are no surprises. The nurses always guided me to check with insurance on specific things (and in fact, called my insurance to confirm on my behalf many times too)</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Fully covered by insurance except for $25 co-pays each visit (thank goodness!)</div>]"

After starting our journey with another doctor, when IVF became the best next step, we had to switch for insurance purposes. Our first visit with Dr. Grifo was comprehensive and very informative. He asked us a tone of questions, talked us through the science of the process in ways that we could understand and was sure to create space and time for any questions that we might have. My husband and I felt very comfortable with him and were eager to get started. Throughout my treatment, I  was fortunate to visit the clinic on his ""days"" which always made me feel better. He was always very thorough and would talk us through the implications of anything that was going on, offering encouragement and support. When our first transfer failed, it was very evident that Dr. Grifo was upset for us. He called us and scheduled a face to face to talk through options and next steps. He assured us it wasn't our fault and that there was hope in terms of next steps both traditional and more innovative, and even offered ideas based on his latest research. He suggested further testing to help inform the course of action. I  saw him for a biopsy, which was uncomfortable, but I always appreciated how Dr. Grifo would talk me through the procedure to help pacify any fears or discomfort. Lastly, we were very fortunate that Dr. Grifo was able to transfer our second embryo, which was successful! It was so great to have him there, and provide us with the confidence and calm that we needed. He told us it was his birthday, and that he had a good feeling about it! When we saw him at one of the first ultra sounds after being pregnant, it was clear how thrilled he was for us. He expressed his joy and confidence in us as parents, and allowed us to hear the heart beat as many times as we wanted!

I was also put on estragen to help encourage a healthy uterine lining for the transfer. During the retrieval process, we retrieved 28 eggs, however, the nurse suggested we use ICSI, to help ensure fertilization given my husbands sperm numbers, were just slightly under the amount they wanted. After the transfer, I was put on progesterone and estrogen to help support the pregnancy. When our first transfer failed, Dr. Grifo suggested a biopsy of my uterine lining to test for bacteria which could have influenced the transfer. It came back negative so he told us to move forward with another transfer. This time around, Dr. Grifo suggested that we might want to try something different just for our peace of mind. So we tried a natural cycle without the use of estrogen and just the use of letrazole. However, after my first visit, Dr. Grifo didn't really like that I  wasn't progressing and decided to put me back on the same cycle we tried before as it seemed to work better.  It did, and that is what got us to our second transfer with Dr. Grifo!

Morning monitoring can be busy, but if you get there early, you are seen quickly and efficiently.

The remaining fibroid continued to be a problem and Dr. Fino continued to suggest 2-3 more hysterscopic myomectomies. In this day and age, women successfully have lap procedures to remove fibroids before conceiving. I do not think that Dr. Fino had my best interest at heart.

2) i was told once by one nurse during a cycle, i am confused by your protocol not sure what to do.  
3) during the beginning of one of my IVF i realized i had a lot of medication left over from cancelled cycle.  i requested that the nurse only provides a prescription for what i needed.  but again since nobody is really following your chart she said she could not do that and would leave me on my voice mail the amount she requested to the pharmacy so i can cross reference with my inventory.  Then, i called the pharmacy myself to reduce the count of each medication.  it is important to call out that fertility medications like Menapure or Gonal can quickly add up to a bill of 5k to 10k depending of the amount.  so for me it was really stressful and careless to have gone about it in this manner.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">NYU fertility is a renowned for their in-vitro success rates.

You see him once in a while in the corridors, and if you are lucky, he'll see you for 1 ultrasound out of 15. When you catch him, in your first appointment or a consultation call post PGS results, he is indeed a star. He will give you his full attention, the full truth, and will be blunt about your chances, which I appreciate, but I can see some women not being a fan of. He knows his numbers inside out, which is great, but that in itself can make you feel like another number compounding that average, that median, and keep you on your tip toes secretly hoping for the moment he will pull you aside and say ""look, I followed your case day by day, I know a lot about you now, and you are not part of this statistic anymore... you are you and this is what I think!"" It's not going to happen, but emotionally I'm in that phase now, as I wait for for my 2nd IVF cycle yet (I'm banking after 1 PGS-tested euploid embryo already frozen).
The retrieval is performed by the doctor in attendance that day, so if Grifo is there 1 out of 5 days, your chances of seeing him are 20%. 
I just went through the embryo transfer course from Fertility IQ and am now freaking out about the performance variances across different doctors within the same clinic. Looking forward to touching base with Grifo to know his POV on this.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Try to take your emotions out of the equation as much as possible. Convince yourself you are making the best possible choice by enduring IVF: 1) you are maximizing your chances, 2) you are controlling the outcome (if you are doing PGS you are screening the best quality embryos in advance, and you are lowering your miscarriage chances to lower rates than mother nature), 3) you are taking an expensive, emotionally tolling, short-cut to starting a family, if time is of the essence for you. 

Personally, IVF me dread every evening of treatment, but I took one day at a time, and even tried to enjoy the fact that I was taking control over my destiny (vs. years worth of trying, especially if you are retrieving a high number of eggs per cycle --imagine the monthly disappointments, or even mourning a miscarriage (which happened to be in the recent past). 

Grifo is a matter-of-the-fact person, so if you are able to rationalize all the facts above, he is the doctor for you. He can be personable, funny, and charmingly smart.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">You feel like a human when you are seen by the team of doctors and nurses, but once you need a follow up call with one of the doctors or nurses, the answering system is efficient, but does make you feel like just another number. They will call you back, but it's often someone you've never spoken to before. Also, sitting in a packed waiting room and having your name called among other 10 names, definitely feels like a manufacturing plant scale... The 1:1 interactions are great (with with exception of billing), but everything else around it is of inhumane scale.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Gonal F, Menopur, Cetrotide and Lupron + HCG triggers. My body responded very well to drug stimulation, and all along, doses of Gonal F and Menopur were being adjusted by doctors so my follicles had time to mature appropriately. Cetrotide was taken to prevent early ovulation, and my triggers consisted of 2 days of Lupron and 1 day of HCG, at 36 and 24hrs prior to retrieval. Triggers are to be shot at specific times, so that generates a little anxiety, especially if you have to excuse yourself from a client meeting for a few minutes :( 
My 1st cycle produced 20+ eggs and 2nd cycle 20+ eggs again. Quality is very different from quantity, so if you can, PGS will give you a good reality check and ensure a lower miscarriage/bad surprises rate. 
I don't have final results yet as I'm still waiting on 2nd cycle results (1st one yielded 1 euploid embryo that is currently frozen).</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The FC NYU is a well-oiled machine. 1:1 interactions with nurses are great. And when you have to call for questions, the message service is tremendously impersonal, but efficient. Nurses will call you back in a couple of hours, and leave very unambiguous voice mails. They are great. 

A few of them are more talkative and will give you invaluable tips (that should probably be part of orientation), such as: 1) if you are doing PGS, what is the best possible way to optimize timing (brith control pills); 2) if you are using the Gonal F or Follastim pens, don't throw them away if they are not completely finished as you can get a full day worth of dosage in it, or even combine it with a brand new cartridge, representing hundreds of dollars of savings in the end; 3) don't buy all drugs at once, get supplies worth a few days, because you never know how quickly your body will respond to drugs, and you might get stuck with a ton of expensive drugs you can't return. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Not a state-of-the art clinic. Success rates, doctors, equipment were what mattered to me, but if you are looking for premium waiting rooms, 1:1 attention from your doctor during the full length of treatment, immediate responses to follow up calls, this may not be the clinic for you. The academic association of this clinic warrants a team approach, so you will have to trust the team of doctors' best practices, proven protocols, years of research and published papers. The few star doctors of the clinic will be there for you if you really need them. But you will need to be a very patient patient.

In FC NYU there are great embryologists, so if you fear your age is determining a lower quality of your eggs, you want that team looking at your embryos and performing biopsies. You also want to go for the PGS testing lab they recommend and trust their interpretation of results. 

One thing I absolutely loathed about this clinic was the billing department. Staff sitting there is misinformed, inefficient, insecure, and unprofessional. Even if you consider that dealing with any insurance is a dreadful process, the billing team should be 200% better at their jobs. Every time I know I have to deal with them, my adrenaline is through the roof. FC, please reassess billing staff + provide better ""client services"" training and make measurable improvements ASAP!</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Efficient well-oiled machine.

They are GREAT!</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Depends. If insurance covers, the value per IVF cycle charged is lower (about $7,500), if you are paying OOP the iVF cycle is about $10,200. Retrieval anesthesia, cryo, transfer, PGS costs, drugs are all separate. I don't have all the info yet because of insurance processing delays, but if you are doing all OOP, costs are as follow (approx. total $: 24,000)

- $15,300 retrieval + cryo + PGS
- $1,000 retrieval anesthesia 
- $2,500 PGS lab testing (minimum fee, pending # of biopsied embryos)
- $5,000 drugs

Insurance scam I leaned about after many hours on the phone amidst my full time job: my Express Scripts insurance drug coverage gives me a lifetime max coverage of $4,000. If I process through insurance 1 pen of Gonal F 900 units, the cost is of $1,900. If I pay OOP, the cost is of $850 through the same pharmacy. So.... with my insurance I was hoping to cover at least 80% of the drugs I needed for 1 cylce, and with 2 pens of Gonal F (approx. 10% of the drugs I actually needed) my life time max was done! 

Appalling... specially when you read Australian blogs in which women go through 10 cycles of IVF for free...</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Not discussed with Grifo yet, but my philosophy is to take as little drugs as possible, especially after the recent bombarding I did to my body, and the fact that I have no issues ovulating and a well functioning endometrium. </div>]"

Immediately upon meeting him, I sensed he had the wisdom of a highly skilled scientist, but the warmth of a family member.  Dr. Berkeley takes a considerable amount of time with his patients to get to know them, and thoroughly explain not only what he thinks is going on case by case, but his strategies for resolving the issues.  He is also a very straight shooter - and by this I do not mean he is brutal with his honesty.  He simply explains odds in a realistic yet comforting manner.  Although we had two failed cycles, we feel very happy under Dr. Berkeley's care and will soon be undergoing  a donor egg cycle as our main issue is diminished ovarian reserve.  I am so grateful to have found Dr. Berkeley and to be under his care.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Because of my age, Dr. Berkeley felt it was imperative to get started on a treatment course quickly.  Unfortunately, my diminished ovarian reserve resulted in two failed IVF cycles, which were heartbreaking to us.  When we were ready, Dr. Berkeley recommended that our best option would be donor egg treatment. We did not feel like he was pushing us against our will, or trying to 'sell' us on something.  It took us awhile, but we felt very comfortable with the decision we made to work with him to accomplish our goal using donor egg as our next step.  NYU is also really on top of making sure you not only understand what is going on in your cycle treatment, but also helping you through every step in the process, either with phone calls or emails. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">For this third cycle, Aleksandra has been my main nurse care coordinator.  She is personable, skilled, scientific and warm.  I could not be more pleased with her care and the time she has taken to answer my questions and reply to my emails.  She is a true compassionate caregiver and I am very grateful.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">NYU is a large place, and there are always many people in the waiting room.  Suffice to say, I have never once felt like a number at this clinic.  I am always greeted with a smile by my caregivers, who call me by name, and am treated with respect.  The billing process at NYU is always scary as you have to check out with full payment before you leave.  Some of those bills will bill enough to give you a coronary.  But hey let's face it - infertility treatment is prohibitively expensive no matter the clinic.  With this in mind, I am more interested in the type of quality healthcare I get for my money.  NYU has been a solid choice for us.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The costs are astronomical no matter where you end up going.  This is the reality of infertility treatment in the US.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">NYU uses the eSET approach unless the multiple embryo transfer is discussed first, and I believe this is used on a case by case basis.  I am comfortable with the fact that Dr. Berkeley uses eSET as I am in my 40's and already at high risk if and when I conceive.  </div>]"

He said if I want to rush he would do IVF(which is costly) but then also suggested I try 3 letrizole IUI cycle after having 3 failed clomid IUI cycles.  With Dr. Grifo I tried 1 letrizole cycle which unfortunately failed. I suggested to try an injectable IUI cycle as I wanted to try something new; however, he did not agree with that and said that he would want to do IVF instead of injectables. I did not understand from him or his nurses why it is a problem to try injectables before IVF.  Also I have an autoimmune condition; however, he does not believe it affects my infertility; however, he was open to me being on certain medications such as blood thinners if needed during a cycle.

As I wrote earlier, he does always call back within a reasonable amount of time but doesn't always seem to know why I would be calling and he would answer questions that I think are significant pretty quickly, so that I wondered if he was considering all of my own unique information or just answering generally what he would tell a patient in a similar situation.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">He is very honest and up-front. Be in touch with him a lot if you want actual feedback re your protocol. Don't rely only on the nurses. He will not oversee your actual case but if you want him to check something, he will. I think in all of our cycles I only saw him in the ultrasound room once during morning monitoring periods.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Licciardi was great about calling me back when I requested a phone call, but he didn't always seem to know who I was or where I was or in what kind of cycle. As a result, I think I was addressing one concern while he was talking about something else, that I didn't even know related to me. When we had actual appointments, he was attentive at those times. Once, I ran into him on my way out after an IUI under his care/protocol, and he didn't wish me good luck or even smile; I thought this was a little odd, but then realized he was probably very busy and/or preoccupied.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">For the egg freezing/retrieval I think he went to highest dose on everything because of my age and other health issues. I was at first freezing eggs as a single woman (with my first doctor, not Licciardi) then embryos with partner for future use (with Licciardi) and eventually thawed the eggs I'd frozen with another doctor (now working with Licciardi) to make those into embryos and did 2 cycles of FET using the eggs from my youngest age. He had me on progesterone shots for one FET cycle, with estradiol pills, even though my cycle is very regular; I was never sure why. And I was on progesterone suppositories for the second FET cycle, no estradiol. I don't remember the egg freezing exactly as it was a few years ago but it was some combination of Gonal-F and Follistim and ovidrel. I know I didn't do the medication that you have to mix together at home when i did the cycle for freezing with him. I'm not really sure of his rationale for the egg freezing --  I guess it's the usual protocol he starts with then adjusts if it doesn't work? For the FET I also didn't know why we were using estradiol when estrogen always normal and I ovulate on my own. Second cycle of FET we tried suppositories because of the pain at my injection site. Also would only transfer one embryo at a time because he said was big risk in having multiples and did NOT recommend PGD or any other biopsy pre implantation. I think he said because egg quality was good. I did have an IUI with letrozole days 3-7 (was supposed to be days 5-9 but there was a miscommunication re what day my period actually started). Also used trigger shot in the morning about 27 hours before IUI. I got pregnant but miscarried around 9 weeks (I had been transferred to OB after heartbeat.) Went back for another IUI two months after miscarriage; not successful. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Very hit or miss. Some excellent nurses. Some not so excellent nurses. It seems in the five years that I've been a patient at NYU that things have gotten more like a factory and there is just a huge volume of patients, more than there was when I was first there. For the most part, everyone is cheerful and upbeat, but they don't all have the same level of experience and I was given misinformation at least once. Also came away from blood taking very bruised once or twice. Had to ice and it wasn't when I was having daily blood tests. On the plus side, if you do get to know one of the nurses, sometimes you can get that person's direct line if you want their opinion. Nurse's take of picture was sometimes different than my doctor's so it was confusing at times.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The staff at the clinic are friendly and upbeat and are generally good about being efficient. They are great about calling roughly when they say they will. Not as much personal attention as I would like because I have multiple health issues. If you are considering IUI, there is one nurse who i think is much better at it than the others but that might just be a personal preference. Be prepared to show up closer to 6:45 a.m. if you want to get in and out of monitoring fast. If you come later, definitely longer waits, especially if you need an ultrasound, too. Definitely be proactive and make sure to communicate with your doctor as much as you are comfortable doing. You must be proactive. I have not been to other clinics so I don't know how this one compares. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">It went relatively smoothly when I was able to be there by 6:45 a.m. Hours don't start till 7 a.m. but like everything in NYC, people get there early and start to line up. When I really needed some sleep and went in a little later, different story. Also, the nurses would ask me for my allergies and what medications I was taking each time even though it was in the computer. I started carrying a list. I think all they cared about was latex but if you have a long list of allergies that you yourself can't remember, it's frustrating to have to recite it every other day. Then sometimes the doctor would make a change of protocol and I wouldn't know why or know that I needed to have my partner there with me for consent forms. It sometimes went flawlessly, other times, not at all so.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">First round, years ago, all out of pocket and nearly $20,000 for an egg retrieval and embryo creation (for freezing). Then the clinic went in network and my 2 FET's were covered by insurance but I reached my lifetime maximum fertility benefit with the 2 FET cycles and everything is out of pocket. I haven't gotten the bill for the IUI but looks as if it will cost a couple thousand because of all the morning monitoring. (I never get the home ovulation test kits to work right for me so I chose to have monitoring done at the clinic and I required a lot during the cycle post-miscarriage.)</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">For me, he definitely was set on single embryo transfer and would not even discuss allowing me to have more than one embryo transferred. He would not budge.</div>]"

He was also great at reviewing the probabilities of women my age being able to conceive using my own eggs.  He is very knowledgeable and experienced in this field, so we trusted him completely.  He knows what he's doing.   The only critical feedback I would give Berkeley to date is communicating better with the patient 1) he didn't mention during the initial consultation how many rounds of ovulation induction and retrieval this might take, especially for someone in my age group. 2) Each failed cycle, we would have appreciated a sit-down face-to-face meeting rather than a follow-up phone call.  Since the initial consult and the first retrieval, I haven't really met with Berkeley, other than the occasional ultrasound during morning monitoring.  Depending on the schedule, I was able to see other doctors at the clinic during morning monitoring, retrievals, transfers, and other procedures.  Those other doctors, during my short and limited interactions, especially Grifo and Hodes-Wertz, exhibited greater empathy and compassion, which I viewed as a plus.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Go into your initial consultation fully organized and prepared with any prior lab work, medical history, genetic testing all relevant to fertility.  Also, make sure that you get clarity on exactly what blood tests and exams you'll need done or updated prior to starting any cycle; infectious disease panel, day 2-3 labs, semen analysis, mammogram, etc.  Also, know that you as patient will have to be the proactive one.  You'll have to make tough decisions on how many rounds of IvF you can handle, whether to transfer mosaic embryos (if that is all you have), how many transfers you're wiling to go through, and when to call it quits.  I understand why NYU Fertility doesn't proactively nudge you in either direction because they are first and foremost a clinic (not a research lab).  But likewise, don't expect any proactive outreachor guidance on whether to continue (unless explicitly advised otherwise) either.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I dealt mostly with the nurses and fellows.  Some of them were very nurturing, caring, and competent.  Others were less so.  Depends on who I got.

Dr. Berkeley is a very matter-of-fact, analytical doctor.  He gives you the straight answers and instill confidence in you that he's competent, experienced and knowledgeable.  That is the primary reason why we went with Dr. Berkeley for all of our IvF rounds.  His communication skills and bedside manners weren't always as consistent or strong.  But we knew that going into the journey not to expect any hand holding of any kind from Dr. Berkeley.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">For the first three ovulation inductions, he prescribed 225 Follistim or Gonal F, 150 Menopur, and Ganirelex.  For my trigger shot, I had to take 2 Ovidrels.  For the fourth ovulation induction, I had the same protocol, except he also added clomid.  

For the one frozen embryo transfer, I was on estrace, medrol, progesterone in oil injections.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Nurses overall were pretty good.  They communicated instructions pretty well and were generally good about returning calls.  A couple nurses in particular were outstanding - they were not only competent at their jobs, but patient with listening to and answering all questions, compassionate and caring, which went above and beyond.  Sandra, Nicky, and Lavina, were a few of the exceptional nurses; they were really kind, and I appreciated their compassion throughout the process.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Different parts of the clinic could get on the same page about protocols.  Seems like the patient coordinator and nursing staff weren't always communicating the same things - for example, when I can start my FET cycle while waiting my PGS results - patient coordinator said no, nurses said yes - that caused confusion.  Some of the preliminary lab test (infectious disease panel bloodwork) fell through the cracks so I had to re-do them.  Embryology lab messed up by telling the nurse 26 eggs were retrieved when in fact only 14 eggs were retrieved (26 was the incubator number).  And finance and billing weren't always the most responsive.  Anesthesiology messed up one of our bills.  

One thing I wished NYU Fertility could have provided is some type of counseling prior to the process and during the process.  I'm not talking about psychological support - because they had that, and frankly, we found unhelpful.  What I'm talking about is someone who was willing to walk us through what to expect in terms of the various decisions we would have to make, how to think through how many rounds, whether and how to make the tough decision on transferring mosaic embryos, how to manage pregnancy loss, when to call it quits, and someone we can provide feedback to directly (and not just some on-line survey after every procedure), etc.  Not just what to expect from a medical perspective, but the impact IvF, FET and mosaic transfers may have emotionally, financially, etc. Someone who acts as an advocate for the patient.  At this time, the nurse, patient coordinator, genetic counselor combined fill that role in limited capacities.  But as patient, we had to seek that out and connect the dots ourselves.  Perhaps this is a resource beyond the clinic's capacity, but that would have been helpful.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Morning monitoring was open without appointments between 7 AM and 9 AM. For the most part, that seemed fair and reasonable.  NYU was good about not having to bring you in unnecessarily.  One advice to future patients is if you're going in only for blood work, see if you can move up the queue, because I often waited a long time unnecessarily just to give one vile of blood.  You get mixed in with the rest of the patients waiting for ultrasounds.   </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Each IvF cycle for Phase 1 - that includes ovulation induction, morning monitoring, egg retrieval (not including Anesthesia), biopsy of up to 6 embryos (for PGS purposes), cryopreservation of embryos and transportation costs to reprogenetics lab was $15,150, out of pocket.  The Phase 2 - which is the frozen embryo transfer as part of this IvF cycle was $2000 out of pocket.   After our second IvF cycle, NYU began to accept our insurance, which helped with bringing down our costs.  However, our insurance did not cover biopsy, shipping/handling of samples.  Reprogenetics, the lab that performs the PGS tests,  had their own fees, which were all out of pocket.  We were charged $1000 base fee, plus $250 per embryo.    </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I was strongly advised by Dr. Berkeley, given my age, to do PGS and aim for a single embryo transfer.  </div>]"

Thankfully, he was right. We were able to transfer 1 fresh embryo, and froze 5 all of which were BB or above.

He was patient in person and by phone, always answering our questions and personalizing his advice.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Go sooner rather than later.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">From the initial visit, it was clear Dr. Grifo was different. He was so personal and personable. He humanized this entire, gut-wrenching process of IVF. While being very data driven and showing us statistics regarding success rates at my age and ovarian reserve level, Dr. Grifo also said I was heroic for undergoing such procedures and to stop blaming myself. He shared his personal story of infertility and feelings of helplessness and failure; can you even imagine a pioneer of IVF feeling like this, let alone admitting it? He made me and my husband feel hopeful, but again he utilized data to explain his beliefs and confidence. During the process, my meds were customized and monitored daily (this was certainly not the case at the prior clinic where we went through three, unsuccessful egg retrievals. The nurses were supremely confident, down to earth and competent. Furthermore, I felt like they were rooting for me and knew me. The Dr who performed the transfer (not Grifo) was incredible; she was realistic, yet optimistic and spoke to me like a real human (not just #7 transfer today).</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">While at first my protocol looked similar to the prior clinic we'd used for 3 rounds of eggs retrievals (all unsuccessful), I quickly saw that NYU was different. The nurses and Drs were constantly evaluating and tweaking my dosage. I took clomid pills, menapur injections, ganerilex injections and double trigger shots. For the transfer there was vaginal and oral estogren pills, as well as other injections. I produced 21 eggs for retrieval, 3 survived until day 5 and 2 tested normal w/ PGS. We transferred 1 embryo and I'm due to have a baby in less than 6 weeks.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">NYU has a smaller clinic on the Westside of Manhattan that was a life saver for me w/ all of the early morning blood draws and ultrasounds. I have to be at work by 8am and going to NYU on the East side would've been very stressful. The nurses were accommodating (arriving early for me), sympathetic and I truly felt like they were rooting for me. They were always patient and kind. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Despite the size and being part of an academic institution, I never felt like a number at NYU. My treatments were so customized and the Drs and nurses so personal, I felt like they really knew me. The technology was also great; iPads to sign in quickly, online secure emails and online videos to help w/ injections. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr Grifo did not accept my primary insurance (Cigna) but did take my secondary (UHC). Many things were covered, but this was our fourth egg retrieval in 1 calendar year so we didn't have a lot of coverage left. Out of pocket was ICSI and PGS, and they charged you in advance and refunded the difference (if fewer embryos made/tested).</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">We had 2 PGS tested embryos at the end of the retrieval and asked Dr Grifo his thoughts on transferring both. He strongly preferred transferring one, saying odds for pregnancy wouldn't increase w/ 2 and given my age (39) why risk both taking and having an even higher risk pregnancy. His rationale was, would you be more upset to not have a 3rd child or lose both and not get the 2nd you've been trying for all this time.</div>]"

My tissue from the D&amp;C had been tested, and it was triploidy, which he explained to me over the phone.  I advised him that Dr. Noyes, who had seen me during this very brief pregnancy mentioned during a monitoring appointment (as it began to become clearer that this was a missed miscarriage) that I had a uterine fibroid and had been incredulous as to why no one had pointed this out to me before.

The nurses were generally pleasant but when my short-lived pregnancy turned out not to be viable, I thought they could have done better.  The nurse who called me to inform me that my HCG levels were declining was a nurse I had never met or spoken to before, and she let me know via voicemail about my declining HCG level and that I should come back on in several days for bloodwork and an ultrasound.

Knowing that I asked him why we didn't transferred 2 the first time as well. we only made 5 embryos so there would always be 1 odd one out and he didn't advise to transfer 3.

Dr. Licciardi was very upbeat with my initial assessment and FSH levels, and quickly got me started on testing and polyp removal to make my chances as high as possible (I had never tried to get pregnant and was doing this with donor sperm).  When my FSH levels subsequently elevated, he was sympathetic but to the point that I might get lucky with IUI and he would support that for 2 or 3 cycles.  I think some women might have taken that as uncaring, but I felt like he was only being honest and not judging me nor did he want to mislead me.  When I failed at IUI but my FSH and estrogen had improved I met with him regarding IVF.  He was not in favor of it, but said we could try and then he had a positive, supportive attitude throughout that process.  When it failed and I cried, saying I felt stupid for trying at my age (I was at that point 44 years old), he told me I shouldn't feel bad at all about that and he seemed quite genuine with his supportive comments.  I commented that I had a family member interested in donating eggs and he was very positive about it.  Overall, I think he is neither mushy-concerned nor cold about his assessments.  He seems genuinely interested in his patients and in helping them.  And when I pushed a little to do something he did not recommend, he quickly took my side.  This was important because I think being very downbeat about the process or feeling like your doctor is annoyed or unsupportive because you don't agree with him can make it all too hard.  I never had that kind of negative experience with him.  But he also was honest and ""to the point"" about the process at each stage, which might seem uncaring to some women.  I am not the kind of person who pushes hard to get my way, and I think that had a positive effect on my interactions with him.  I do not know if that aspect of my personality may have hurt my chances, such as when I only had 2 follicles with my IVF cycle (at a high level of hormone treatments) and he said we needed to convert the cycle to IUI.  I now feel pretty confident he made the right call.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The patient should expect honesty, but understand he and the clinic are trying to get good numbers.  He will recommend what he thinks gives you the best chance of success at having a baby, especially considering most of us have limited resources and usually can't do more than two IVF cycles with our insurance.  As a patient, you want to pull out all the stops.  I think that dynamic goes on with all the doctors. But I do believe he really believes in his work and wants to help.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Licciardi found the right balance of understanding/sympathy and honesty when I was unsuccessful and couldn't help but cry.  He also gave me a chance at IVF with my own eggs after honestly telling me that he would not recommend it, and he had a positive attitude throughout the process.  Finally, the nurse staff were very supportive of me during the various processes I went through.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">It's been quiet a while and don't remember a lot of details.  He recommended IUI cycles with HG injections to time the injections.  With IVF he went high on the hormones, which I think was right given my age.  He also said with IVF that they won't do retrievals unless there are at least three follicles.  I only had two so he recommended I stop the medications and just to HG injection with IUI.  With the donor egg cycle, we synchronized our cycles with birth control pills and then went to estrogen pills and progesterone shots daily.  I don't know the rest of the protocols for the egg donor.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">They were very helpful, but also very busy in the mornings.  The donor egg staff were very professional but very warm as the process went on.  The lead nurses on the regular staff were very kind to me and I appreciated it.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I really like the no appointment, two-hour window in the morning for the blood draws.  But sometimes there are problems/back-ups and you never know when you will have one of those mornings when everyone shows up at the same time and you have to wait quite a while.  So be prepared to wait and perhaps be late for work if that is where you are going next.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I don't remember much.  I think the first IVF cycle was maybe $10k or $12k before insurance.  The frozen embryo cycle was less than $5k.  Frozen embryo cost $1,200 plus another $1k annually for storage.

Dr. Noyes was straightforward, candid, warm but a bit brisk (I am OK with that), and made it clear that she would give you as much or as little detail as you wanted.  She told me at the first visit that she thought she could get me pregnant ""one way or another,"" and she did. She originally planned to go straight to a donor egg cycle, but while waiting for a donor I unexpectedly got pregnant the old fashioned way (courtesy of my husband) for about ten minutes, until I had an early miscarriage. Still, that was enough evidence to prompt Dr. Noyes to suggest one more cycle using my own eggs.  We tried that, but it did not work.  Next, a donor became available and we had a long talk about how many embryos to implant.  I wanted to be aggressive, in light of my age and history.  Dr. Noyes eventually agreed to 4, with all kinds of contingency plans if I ended up with too many.  As it turned out, one took.  Dr. Noyes discharged me from the fertility clinic at 3 months but sent a lovely note when  my first daughter was born.  Somewhat amazingly, I got pregnant again -- also the old-fashioned way -- when daughter #1 was 6 months old.

Sometimes classical music would be playing today's top hits and I really liked that when it was on. The colors in the waiting room were a little dark and dreary. Sometimes the phlebotomist didn't introduce themselves by name but kindly greeted me as I went back for blood work. My very first visit was a little confusing as I had never been to a monitoring appointment before and didn't know the process / what to expect and I didn't receive instructions from the front desk check in coordinators when you sign in. I think that all new patients that come in for their first monitoring appointment should be told what to expect and what the process entails (sign your name on the sticker with your doctors name, sit in the waiting room until your name is called by a nurse, go back and get your blood work done, go back into the waiting room and wait to be called for your ultrasound, following the ultrasound go to the check out desk and formally check out and speak with a billing coordinator.) I had to self navigate my first appointment but after the initial monitoring appointment I got the hang of things in terms of the process. The nurses were always very pleasant. The billing coordinators required retraining in terms of how to speak to patients compassionately during check out. I made RMA NY aware of this immediately and shortly after I provided this feedback the billing coordinator experience improved drastically. At the end of the day, all I cared about was that I was under the care and supervision of Dr. Copperman and his team. Go to your monitoring appointment at 6:50 - 7AM - the early bird gets the worm and there are way less patients there and you get in and get right out!</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Monitoring was super convenient. I highly recommend that you go in right when monitoring hours open / start and you'll get right in and out of there. The phlebotomist should be taking the time to explain blood work during your first monitoring appointment so that you understand as I was confused my first appointment. The nurses for my ultrasounds were very nice but I had to tell Dr. Copperman that nurses should always introduce themselves prior to an ultrasound taking place. After I provided that feedback, all the nurses introduced themselves by name prior to my ultrasounds. I wish the waiting room had a better, brighter, more welcoming atmosphere.

I appreciated this feedback because I've heard of stories where the doctors go straight for IVF even though simpler treatments would work just as well. Dr. Stein prescribed me Letrozole for 5 days and a trigger shot midway through my cycle, and in two months I was pregnant! I appreciate his professional recommendation and his honesty when it came to the right treatment for me.  
The nurses and staff were also very nice and I never had to wait too long during monitoring hours. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Just know that the clinic is very busy so don't expect the doctor or nurses to spend a lot of time with you. They will answer questions, but they will mostly go through their general activities and inform you if everything is ok or not. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I enjoyed how quickly the RMA team dealt with patients, however, sometimes I felt like my doctor didn't even remember who I was. I asked things as follow up to questions from the previous weekly visit and he had no idea that he had seen me before. It wasn't ideal, but it also didn't bother me much. I understand he has lots of patients and my main concern was the end goal, which worked out in just two cycles of the treatment.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The nurse was my least favorite part of the treatment. I had an accident while I was on the treatment and called her with a concern of having lost the baby, but she showed zero emotions. I wasn't expecting her to support me as if I was her best friend, but I would've appreciated more reassurance that my baby could be fine... enough reassurance to calm me up until my next doctor visit.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The biggest strength is that they know what they're doing.The doctors and nurses are very professional, and they will recommend a treatment that will help you with your specific fertility issue. Although not necessarily a weakness, but just mostly a reality of life, they're there to provide a service and might not always give you the emotional support that an excited and anxious potentially mom-to-be is expecting.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">$50 copay for visits, plus $60-$80 for letrozole pills and trigger shot.</div>]"

This really didn't hurt my feelings - I've known about my condition for a long time, but if a patient were more sensitive, I suppose this could be a weakness of his. His pros outweigh the ""con"" in my mind - he's thorough, aggressive in treatment, and does listen to questions and walk you through next steps. My first cycle was fine - I ended up getting 12 eggs, 7 mature, 6 fertilized. Of those 6, 3 made it to blast and all 3 were ""chromosomally"" normal. That's a great yield, but for this next round, we're taking a different approach to try and get more mature eggs and hopefully have more embryos to work with.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Be prepared with a list of questions and paper/pen. He can be quick when he walks you through problems/next steps/etc. Very open to answering questions, but if you don't have any prepared, the meeting might be over before you had time to think of them.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Stein is very direct and to the point. I wouldn't ever describe him as warm, but he listened to my concerns and answered all my questions, spoke with me on the phone when I asked for a call, and has been quick responding to my emails (I am undergoing a second round with him this spring). He'll tell it like it is without sugarcoating, but honestly that's the type of person I want in charge of my care.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">We used an antagonist protocol. Because we'll be using a GC, I was basically treated like an egg donor. Had to undergo FDA testing, genetic testing, etc before starting. I'm only 30, but egg quality/quantity was seemingly not an issue to begin with - we just wanted to retrieve eggs, make embryos, and freeze them for future use. It turned out my reserve is more diminished than AMH originally indicated, so I was put on doses more commonly used with 40 year olds. Can't remember specific doses, but all were quite high - 225 Gonal H, 3 or 4 menopurs a day in the beginning. Given that 5/12 eggs were immature, we're changing it a little this time to try and get more mature eggs. I was not put on birth control the first cycle, which apparently can promote consistency in follicular growth, so less of a chance of some follicles beating others. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The IVF coordinator I worked with - Kiran - is/was lovely. She's quick to respond over email, call, etc, and always had a great disposition, even when unmatched by mine. My only frustration came from the coordination between Kiran, the nurses, doctor, and 3rd party reproduction team a few times. Because there are so many cooks in the kitchen, communication failed a few times. IE, I was told that I'd be starting another cycle in April this spring, and learned (quite late) that it wouldn't be able to take place until May. This wouldn't have bothered me except that no one really told me - I had to find out myself. All a result of each team member thinking that someone else was going to tell me. I don't think this would be a problem for most, but if you're using a GC, you'll have to work with 3rd party repro and IVF, and those two need to communicate just a little bit better.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">RMA is, for the most part, extremely organized. I felt well-cared for 99% of the time - nurses always called when the said they would, I never had to wait longer than 10 minutes for monitoring (and that would be when the waiting room was packed!), and everyone really seems to know what they're doing. Every fellow/doctor I saw while monitoring was incredible, and the people who performed my retrieval seemed great. Very pleased with the outcome of the cycle, and I'm sure I have to credit the clinic and the doctors/embryologists for their great work. That said - it is a big place. As I mentioned earlier, if  your situation is slightly out of the ordinary and you need to work across a few teams, it sometimes feels like you need to stay on top of everyone. I was a little surprised that it took nurses/coordinators a while to realize that I was waiting for their next steps, only to learn they all thought I was in touch with one of them the whole time. You do need to be organized with multiple teams. If you're just working with one coordinator though, I think RMA has it fully in hand.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Monitoring hours are from 7 - 8:30 am, but they definitely saw people after the end time (I'd always see women running in super late). The good thing about RMA is they have locations all over the city, so it's pretty convenient (ie, I had a meeting one morning on the east side. RMA UES is not my primary location, but I could be monitored there and then went right to my work meeting after). Sometimes the waiting room was crowded (usually on weekends, when only one location is open), but honestly there were always chairs and you always got in and out very quickly. I still felt like I had time to talk to the doctors and nurses on busy days, too. Overall a pretty easy experience. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The total cost of embryo freezing was about $17,000. Embryo testing was about $150/embryo plus a fee. We had 3 embryos tested and it was $600. I've heard others with much higher expenses (RMA uses a third party company).
Most of my regular visits were covered by insurance, but I have had to pay about...$500 or so (maybe more) in testing, which was partially covered by insurance.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">We haven't crossed this bridge, but my doctor and the clinic do not believe in multiple embryo transfers unless the mother is over a certain age or there's another medical reason to do so.</div>]"

They had me wait for a while then said nobody could see or speak with me because I was too far along (had been told conflicting info earlier in my treatment). At this point I’d been going to RMA for over a year and this was shocking and very upsetting. I insisted on speaking with someone and the clinician who told me “legally we can’t see you” wouldn’t tell me her name and was very antagonistic.

For the first part of the IVF treatment, I did two weeks of injections, going to my doctors office 10 times in those 14 days for blood work and ultrasounds.  Once my hormone levels were up and my follicles were large enough I was scheduled for the egg retrieval.

Medications were ordered last minute before a trip and I nearly missed a cycle due to the poor response. I never got an apology for their carelessness/disorganization/lack of responsiveness.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">We did 4 cycles with Clomid (some where cancelled due to cysts). Due to my response to Clomid (and my concerns about elevated risks for breast/ovarian cancers), we changed to Letrozole for IUI. We did 3 cycles of IUI. Since research does not show additional benefit after 3 cycles of IUI, we discussed moving on to IVF. We did 2 cycles, first using an antagonist-protocol, the second using an estrogen-priming antagonist protocol (which adjusts for my high estrogen levels early in the cycle). Both had a high number of oocytes retrieved, but poor egg maturation/embryo blastulation rates. After 2 retrievals, we did 2 transfers. Neither resulted in a pregnancy, so we did additional testing and I sought additional opinions to make sure we were not overlooking anything. The testing revealed my husband had a balanced translocation. To potentially improve my embryo quality for the 3rd retrieval we changed to back to an antagonist protocol using an additional Letrozole flair during treatment. However, that cycle was the least successful - 2 embryos after 1 week but PGS testing showed they were both abnormal. Dr. McAvey then had a frank conversation about what to consider going forward and encouraged me to seek other opinions.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Olga is cold, disorganized, provides inconsistent instructions to Dr. McAvey and Anna (for instance, she will say you have to take a HPT on Thursday instead of on Wednesday, she sometimes says incorrect medication dosage, she's not personable). In contrast, I saw Anna less frequently but she was always much more friendly and her instructions were more in line with Dr. McAvey.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The strengths - RMA clinical team includes financial resources (if you have insurance, they will do all of the calls for your benefits, bills, authorization for medications). All you have to do is call to authorize your insurance for the IVF benefit. They do have an organized system. However, at times that same organization is a detriment. RMA treats you like a number. On one of my retrieval cycles, a new Dr (I had never met before) did my retrieval. He barely introduced himself to me. Then after the procedure was done, I had to ask multiple times for Tylenol to treat the pain and for the oocyte count. In addition, the nurses rushed me out while I still felt groggy and confused from the anesthesia. On another visit, a transfer cycle - I requested to transfer 2 embryos. The dr. nearly bit my head off, he was nasty/short. It made the rest of the transfer an uncomfortable experience and hard to relax after. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">First come, first serve. The LI office was usually quiet.

Every time I went in for monitoring aka ""cattle call"" I saw a different doctor. They were all very nice and I'm sure great doctors but the problem is with these big clinics is that you really don't have one person truly dedicated to your success. 

IVF is all about timing. How can a doctor that hasn't even seen my ovaries make any sort of decisions on my cycle? And even if she wasn't there for all the visits, she never once called or emailed me to see how I was feeling. 

No one ever told me what my embryos were graded or was wrong with the embryos after testing. It was my first time doing IVF and didn't even know to ask.

I was never told any blood work results. I learned I didn't really know much about anything until I got my medical records to move over to a fertility doctor.

I also felt they dropped the ball with the last cycle. Then on about 5 days into this last cycle, a dr said there were only 3 eggs that looked mature. So I emailed Dr McAvey asking if she thinks there are only going to be 3 viable eggs then maybe we should cancel the cycle. We're paying this out of pocket so not trying to throw 15k out the window.

Then the next day she upped my dose drastically like a Hail Mary attempt to get some more eggs to mature. The day before retrieval my I believe my biggest one with over 23mm which is huge and one or 2 others over 20. I feel she pushed those to the limit to try to get some others to grow.

The nurse was rushed and said that we lost a lot of eggs in the thawing process and the fertilization process, and that we also lost more than normal during the stage of growing embryos to the 5-day blastocyst stage.  She offered no explanation why our results were so bad.   My husband and I were so upset that we called the clinic three times to arrange for a conversation with Dr. Grunfeld. When we finally spoke to him, the doctor was flip.  He said that my eggs (and our resulting embryos) did not do as well as planned, but that these results were statistically possibly and essentially no big deal. Dr. Grunfeld then suggested we simply do another IVF cycle--as if it were no big deal financially, physically, or emotionally.  I was disappointed, particularly because Dr. Grunfeld had been so optimistic that securing 24 eggs through a freezing cycle would yield good results. Dr. Grunfeld spoke to me and my husband for only around five minutes.  The casualness of his reaction to the fact that my husband and I had two miscarriages (conceived without IVF) and a failure egg freezing/fertilization cycle shocked us.  We indicated that we would seek another opinion before determining how to proceed.  Neither Dr. Gurnfeld nor his office ever called us back to ask what we wanted to do. The entire interaction with Dr. Grunfeld and RMA left us feeling that the doctor and clinic as a whole only cared about our money--not about delivering health care that would help us conceive.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Grunfeld gave me gonal F and Follistum for egg stimulation. He also added ganirelex later in the cycle and Ovidrel for trigger. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The nurses had little interaction with me. They would call each day with my dosage of stimulation drugs. But they did not get to know me or even engage in friendly conversation. I felt like a step in the factory assembly line.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">RMA has very good doctors--but the entire approach of the clinic is to do large numbers of IVF  and egg freezing cycles without little care for the patient.  It is very difficult to arrange for a one-on-one conversation with the doctor or nursing staff.  I felt like a number during my egg freezing cycle and when I returned to the clinic to use my frozen eggs -- which did not yield any usable embryos.  The clinic is also very challenging to work with concerning billing. Even though my insurance provider covers IVF, RMA required me to pay the clinic directly for certain procedures, which forced me to seek reimbursement from my insurance company.  On one occasion, the doctor recommended that I take a certain test; the RMA billing staff indicated that because they could not guarantee that my insurance company (CIGNA) would cover it, I would just have to pay for the cost directly I was disappointed that RMA, as a clinic that works on a daily basis with CIGNA, would not facilitate my access to IVF coverage by discussing my need for this test with the insurance provider. This was just one example of many by which the clinic conveys that all it cares about is your money, rather than whether the services provided yield the patient the best chance at having a healthy, live baby.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I paid approximately $11K for egg freezing, $4K in storage fees, $3K in genetic testing for me and my husband, and $3K for egg thawing and PGS testing. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Grunfeld prefers SET, which is fine.

3. He set me up with a nutritionist so that I could lose weight and learn how to eat better for a person with PCOS (and I lost 60 pounds!).
4. He tested me for bacterial endometritis (which can happen in women that have had IVF and IUI and can prevent implantation during FET) and I definitely had it.

In broad strokes, the cycles were similar not not identical. The cycles all started with differing levels of Follistim and Menopur, followed by Ganirelix. We shifted from a Lupron trigger to a larger HCG trigger as our treatments progressed. 

We went in to the Garden City office for monitoring (blood and sono) during weekdays (we needed to run to the main Manhattan office on weekends). We would do a retrieval in Manhattan, followed by a fresh transfer on Day 5 (RMA only offers Day 5 transfers) and we always forewent PGS genetic testing. 

Our second cycle did produce a positive pregnancy result, but only lasted seven weeks until a miscarriage occurred. As we progressed in our cycles, we also decided to explore other, complimentary, options to our medical treatment. These ranged from added vitamins and antioxidants to thrice weekly acupuncture to more experimental methods involving immune-therapy. Dr Flisser was mostly receptive to our concerns, but did tell us when he thought these alternative methods would interfere with our regular regimen. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Olga was our local coordinator, she handled our paperwork and telling us our lab results and what was expected for the following day or week, whichever was appropriate.

Once you get a handle on when things are busy and how long they last, it is very easy to work around the monitoring hours. However, my wife and I had a great deal of flexibility in our morning schedules, which allowed us to handle the monitoring quite easily, your results may vary. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The costs were considerable, but we were fortunate enough to have very good insurance and our insurance company classified this place as a ""center of excellence"" which offered it's own significant advantages. We also had a finance coordinator who took care of our billing for us. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">In general, Dr Flisser is open to lots of different approaches, but does work from the overall statistics about what works best for the most people. This is a great overall approach, but may not work for everyone by definition, so it is important to be active in your own care. </div>]"

He is very much a scientist reflecting on data and analysis to determine best course of treatment. I can't complain because we have so far gotten the results we wanted. So his system must work. It can also be hard to get an appt with him as he is VERY busy so sometimes it seems that you speak via the nurses to him versus hearing your plan straight from your doctor.

Clarissa did all the paperwork and was very organized and on top of her stuff. Kayla did fiances and really knew her stuff. We were self pay, and she helped us figure out of there was any way to cut some costs or make it a little lighter. Melissa is the IVF nurse and not only called with all my protocol, but would also immediately follow up with an email. When I got pregnant, I experienced a lot of spotting. Melissa was awesome about answering me by email or phone, and made sure all my neurotic questions were answered and me and baby were safe. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Strength: The know what they’re doing. There’s always a nurse to answer questions. The staff is overall very friendly and accommodating. 

Weakness: During monitoring, and especially at RMA East, you can feel like just a number. It gets super busy and sometimes you wait for upwards of a hour. Sometimes you don’t get to see your doctor, which can be stressful.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">All the monitoring hours are in the morning before work, but the earlier you go the better. RMA downtown is a smaller practice so much better wait time and smoother experience. RMA East is their main office and incredibly busy. They definitely see pts who are bloodwork/ultrasound before those who are just bloodwork. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">We were self pay. Only thing insurance helped with was medications (which is a huge help).

There was one doctor at RMA that I didn't particularly care for (his bedside manner was not a match for me) that did one of my IUI's, and I would never have actually chosen him to do it. At RMA, you are very limited when it comes to choice in that sense. I didn't even SEE the doctor who did my IVF egg retrieval. I was already under anesthesia before he even came into the room.

He was recommended by a different friend who had a successful IVF cycle with him. 
So in summary, Dr. Mukherjee was pretty much kind, but we just felt rushed each time we saw him and then at our last consultation to discuss the failed embryo, he seemed to be pessimistic about future fertility treatments and didn't really seem to hear us that we were thinking of a second child. Also, the only thing that changed about our protocol between the first egg freezing and the 2nd time which was embryo freezing, was that he added Clomid and Ganirelix to my protocol.

The protocol included Gonal-F and Menopur and the trigger shot. I actually started taking the injections fully on Day 4 because my Day 2 was a Sunday, and they told me to come in on Monday. After some confusion with Freedom Pharmacy and also the quite unclear videos from RMA on the injection methods (because I didn't have my medications or syringes with me to get a real life demo from the nurse), I ended up not injecting Gonal F or Menopur fully on Day 3. I'm not sure if my lateness in finally getting the injections correct meant that I had less stimulation, but anyway, I did manage to get 1 egg harvested and frozen. I was hoping for 2, but they said that one of the eggs was already degenerated when they harvested them.

I then tried an embryo freezing cycle in February 2020, and this time, he added Clomid and Ganirelix to my protocol. I took all the Clomid prescribed (5 days) and 1 day of Ganirelix, but the result of 1 egg harvested was the same.

At that time, United Healthcare helped cover some medications, but I mainly used my 75% discount Compassionate Care card. My insurance did not cover the cycle.

She didn't really explain things clearly to me, and this would have been essential as it was my first cycle and I had never done injections before. I don't think she was there on my first nurse visit, so I spoke with another nurse. I remember being particularly frustrated when it seemed that Freedom Pharmacy and RMA were making me determine things about the medications that were totally unclear to me (regarding dosages, units, etc.) and I just broke down crying at some point while on the phone with a different nurse at RMA because Antionette wasn't available. The stress of the egg freezing cycle was already overpowering, and the fact that they each seemed to expect me to already know everything despite the videos not being totally clear was unfair, I felt. 

My other nurse Abigail Epstein when I did the February 2020 cycle was much nicer and attentive and I saw and met with her often. I think she was in training when I was doing my last cycle, actually, and she remembered my partner also. Anyway, of course I knew much better what I was doing, but unfortunately, the cycle wasn't successful as an embryo freezing cycle, and that makes me a little doubtful as well of the 1 egg I have frozen still at RMA.

They seemed professional, but definitely it felt like a factory there, and a little disorganized. The waiting room was a bit depressing; I think for your first cycle, things are overwhelming always and for subsequent cycles, you get used to things more. I thought the nurses who gave the bloodtests were super pro; the doctors giving the ultrasounds for monitoring always seemed in a rush though they were professional, but I remember the first time I went for monitoring, they didn't even instruct me on what I should do next or even if I could wipe myself off with what materials and what to do with the gown...they just left me there. Luckily my partner was there. It didn't feel like a particularly nurturing environment. But I talked to a friend who had had success with IVF and that did help because she warned me about the factory feeling.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">It was convenient to have this monitoring hours range, but I found that the earlier I went, the faster I was seen.

His only change between round 1 and 2 was to bump up the hormones - no additional testing for any unknown factors that caused the issues. When the 2nd egg retrieval didn't work, he treated us like we were the problem and left me wondering if I had unknown fertility issues. We switched to another doctor and I'm now pregnant after one very successful round of IVF, with four frozen embryos to spare. So clearly, the problem wasn't with me.

Considering I had been pregnant 3 times naturally before coming to the clinic, I think they just assumed his sperm was healthy. It wasn't until I personally had to enforce it did my husband get his sperm analysis and now here we are 8 months later still not pregnant, but found out that my husband has 0% motility. My 40th birthday is this year, and we will have to make a big decision about IVF. I loved her bedside manner and how personal and sweet she was, but I felt like she would just increase my dosage of Clomid each month I didnt get pregnant and was chalking it up to unexplained infertility, and shouldn't have even allowed us to do IUI without him having a sperm analysis. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">To make sure you ask every question you have, as she doesn't really give answers unless you come with questions. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I felt like a human because I could really tell she cared.

When I started seeing her she was nothing but human, and caring and understood my fears and anxieties after such a huge loss. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">First we tested my AMH and it was very good, and since I had been pregnant 3 times before we just did a non-medicated natural cycle that she monitored. I produced follicles on my own, ovulated according to the blood work, etc. Then when that didn't work she suggested we go right to IUI unmedicated and I did one unmedicated and it didn't work. Then we did one IUI cycle where I took 50mg of clomid, and then they gave me the trigger shot of ovidrel and that IUI also failed. Then I didn't have any more money for IUI's and my insurance covers NOTHING for fertility treatments. So then she decided to increase my dose of clomid to 100mg and then I gave myself the trigger at home, negative again. Then she increased me to 150mg clomid and I did the trigger shot again at home, negative. That following month she discovered a polyp on my uterus and I had read that was a side effect of clomid. On Feb, 14th 2017 I had the polyp surgically removed. Before we started trying again and while I was healing I had my husband go get his sperm analysis.

The weaknesses were that it has a feeling of being a business and that they almost hope you have to jump to IVF.

He explains things well and is a realist - a described pessimist. I think he did a good job with our egg retrieval, as he was very exacting about my timing and when to trigger. We got good results from the retrieval (though a lot of that is because of my eggs). 
I found the transfer VERY uncomfortable (I am not a great gyno patient) and he was incredibly impatient and unsupportive in the moment. My transfer took, but then I miscarried at 5.5 weeks, exactly the same time I had miscarried with my two natural pregnancies. Despite the fact that he had pushed for IVF to control for embryo quality, and then the embryo quality didn't seem to make a difference (they were PGD tested), he had no explanation for why I might have miscarried. He also was not overly sensitive and wanted to just 'try again.' he said it's a numbers game. He was very dismissive of my suggestions (other women in my family had a bicornuate uterus, but he immediately said I didn't have that). 
When I went to get a second opinion from another clinic, they suggested a different protocol. I brought that suggestion back to him and he was immediately dismissive, judgmental and unprofessional. He told me that clinic had a 'terrible reputation' (despite the fact that he had trained the doctor) and that their suggestions were off-base. This was a phone call, after not responding to my email for a few weeks. He claimed he had. Overall, he left a very bad taste in my mouth and I felt unsafe/uncared for in his care. I think he is very smart and knows his stuff but is very arrogant and not open-minded.

Also didn't seem to check my chart). 
I found him dismissive and not patient with my questions.
Having said that, despite the huge amount of patients at RMA, overall I thought they did a good job in making patients feel heard - I just didn't necessarily feel that with Dr Stein.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I believe it was a standard protocol, with menapur, gonal F, and the trigger. for the transfer, we used PIO and estrace. 
When I wanted to add lovenox for low grade anticardiolipin levels, he was not supportive. Said it was risky (for bleeding) and wouldn't help. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Eliza is amazing!! There was another nurse too who comforted me when I cried about starting PIO. I wish I remember her name.
Overall, the nurses are amazing there. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">RMA is a strong clinic and well organized. It is huge, and they do a good job of managing individual cases. They always return phone calls within the hour.
It does feel like a bit of a factory given the size.
They are also fairly conservative/traditional. They do not believe in immunology issues and are not particularly open/imaginative about understanding RPL. They are very evidence-based, which is not a bad thing, but I do wonder since other places are more open to experimental treatments! </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I liked that the hours were early and I could go before work, and the window of time was substantial. However, it is such a huge place that sometimes I would wait an entire hour. And there was no way to predict it! So I'd have to go much earlier than I wanted just in case. It did feel a bit like cattle call. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">For me, Dr Stein believed strongly in transferring one embryo, because multiples bring higher risks.

I went through 3 IVF cycles with Dr. Kudesia, all with different protocols.

They are not open to day 3 transfers.  Since transferring to a different practice, we've done secondary tests for genetics, a biopsy identifying an infection, sperm fragmentation test and uncovered issues with each of these.

When his business office completely miscommunicated what the cost of our experiences would be, he gave us ‘professional courtesy’  (my husband was a PGY1 in the Mount Sinai system and had gotten an MD/PhD at Mount Sinai as I well), generously taking care of basically one frozen transfer cycle.

I got pregnant on our second round - a blighted ovum that we terminated with cytotec at 8 weeks. Because of this second loss, he suggested we do a immunology work up and we found that I  heterozygous for factor v lieden with positive antibodies. I wish he could have recommended a hematologist who took insurance but he couldn’t. I found one and she was fine though didn’t think I needed blood thinners. I appreciated that Dr. Sandler insisted. We did an egg harvest, genetic testing, and FET to control as many variables as possible. I loved that he insisted the progesterone suppositories were just as effective and less stressful, and so I used those and estrace of course. First fet was a chemical positive.

He educated us on some of the misconceptions we had - ex: the chromosomal test results after 2nd miscarriage resulted in no abnormalities in the fetus. Therefore we had ruled out chromosomal abnormality as one of the reasons for miscarriage in our case. However, Dr Stein explained that if the tested fetus was male then only we could be absolutely sure that the sample was of the fetus. As in our case this was female, there was a chance that the sample may have been of the mother and not the fetus. 

If other things were not an issue, he suggested IVF as our best option. Although initially we were not sure whether we need to opt this as our first course, he patiently discussed and explained the complications of IUI given my history of Ectopic; and how there is an option to use the ICSI &amp; PGS tested embryos to reduce the chances of miscarriage due to chromosomal abnormalities, thereby reducing 2 major risks. 

Dr Stein was present at most of monitoring sessions during retrieval and transfer cycle. He ensured all our questions were answered at these visits and also was available via. email if needed. He coordinated with my other doctors such as endocrinologist and hematologist whenever necessary. Even after the transfer cycle, there were instances where we assumed it was not going to be successful due to spotting/bleeding. However, Dr Stein was very reassuring at each visit; conducted extra blood and ultrasound monitoring whenever necessary; and adjusted the medications immediately when needed. 

I would highly recommend Dr Stein for his knowledge, experience and excellent care &amp; service through out the process.

They were also very helpful in navigating me to the right pharmacy to get medication immediately, when my initial pharmacy failed to deliver on time. Excellent co-ordination and timing during morning monitoring hours. It took me less than half hour most days for monitoring in the morning and was able to get back to work on time. Initial paperwork, tests for spouse, insurance approvals were also handled without any hassles.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Strengths - Excellent doctors, good lab providing results on same day, great team of staff who are available all days of week and very friendly, very comfortable monitoring hours accommodates working people, doctor and nurses available via. email or call for answering any questions, immediate attention and treatment when required.

I had to get blood taken at multiple times at different locations due to communication problems with the RMA’s authorization protocol. Also, when I was miscarriage get no doctors on call would get back to me. RMA does not give out direct lines to your doctors or nurses assigned to you, so when you call in with a question or problem, it takes 20 minutes to get to the right person’s voicemail Then, you have to wait for a call back which was complete inconvenient because you get caught in a game of phone tag without anyone actually answering your question.  RMA’s system of communicationis completely unrealistic exspecially as a full time professional. The nurses who take your blood are rude and have awful bedside manner.

When I went for office visits, I saw a rotating set of doctors instead of my primary doctor, Dr. Thornton. I felt more like a number then a human at RMA.

He is a nice person, very well experienced in the field, and he will answer questions if you have them but he (and RMA) seem to be very set on their standard mode of operations.

It's like a machine, somewhat well oiled, with the exception of their finance department which seems in a bit of disarray. I think being just another number is okay if the protocol works for you, and it does for many. I have a friend and also my OBGYN that have had success for RMA. Unfortunately this was not the case for me and I feel like I could have done with more specialized attention and personalized protocol. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I went through 3 retrievals with Mukherjee. The first protocol he used was the antagonist protocol, which is surprising to me as I've read it is for poor responders or people with PCOS, of which I am neither. The second protocol was antagonist with estrogen priming. Those first 2 cycles resulted in no viable embryos for transfer. The third protocol was down regulation, which I've read is the place where most doctors start but he said is ""old technology"". I ended up with 1 viable embryo (which ultimately ended up in a chemical pregnancy). During the 9 month period I was under his care I probably saw or spoke to him 5 times. He likened the first 2 unsuccessful attempts to bad luck. After the 3rd unsuccessful cycle he's referred me to a reproductive immunologist since my infertility is still ""unexplained"".

Dr Copperman was brilliant where and when it counted. I think he assumed certain knowledge - perhaps because he knows I had been through multiple cycles in the past or perhaps because his nursing team should have briefed me - certain things weren’t explained very well to me and caused me days of anxiety needlessly. This may be a comment more appropriate for the clinic...?</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Ask all your questions at your initial consult or email him directly if you aren’t getting the answers from the nursing team or from him during monitoring sessions.
Appeal and request his attendance at procedures directly to Dr Copperman and also have the nursing team note he request so it’s in the system as well. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The good and not so good: 
Not so good: During monitoring sessions, the interaction with Dr Copperman was brief but he aligned my monitoring days to his rostered days so I was able to see him. I only figured this out towards the end of my retrieval cycle - I would not have gone to RMANY west for monitoring if I had known this from the start. 
He didn’t really address my questions well during the monitoring sessions.
The good/great:
Twice, I wrote an email to Dr Copperman with some late night anxieties / questions. One was on Thanksgiving Day. On both occasions, he wrote back same day, answering my questions without making me feel like I was hassling him or asking stupid questions. 
I was surprised to find out that you may not necessarily get your Dr for your retrieval / transfer procedures - that it just depended on whose day your procedures happened to fall.  This was not the case at the other clinics (in LA and Australia) where the default was your Dr would operate unless they were on leave. I made a request to the clinic and directly to dr Copperman and both times, he said he would do his best to move things around and both times, he turned up!! For my retrieval, I’m pretty sure he really did move his schedule as they told me that I had another Dr while I was in the waiting room ... and then dr Copperman showed up! His operating bedside manner was great - positive, empathetic, focused.
In summary, not every in-person interaction with Dr Copperman is consistent but it was always great when it really counted.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Retrieval stim: gonal-f, luprolide, menopur
Trigger shot: ovidrel
Transfer: estradiol, progesterone shots. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">My primary nurse was appalling. Never picked up the phone, voice was always monotone and answers seemed almost scripted. 
Other nurses I saw during monitoring or happened to be connected to on the phone were much better - much more informative, compassionate, patient, responsive. It’s a shame that my primary nurse was so unhelpful - a better nurse could’ve answered my questions more directly, prevented my anxieties and me reaching out to Dr Copperman. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Finance department was not great. Not responsive unless they were calling you for payment. Inflexible and not informed / empowered to deal with non-standard requests. Monitoring was efficient and well run. The old ladies who do bloods at RMANY east clinic are amazing - barely felt anything! I prayed one of the two ladies called my name! 
Cycle coordinators: briefly dealt with One (Dr Mukherjee’s) who was super organised and communicative. I wish she had kept my case. But I changed Drs after one consult (incidentally, the transfer was smooth) and Dr Copperman’s cycle coordinator was not organised, not a good communicator and not very responsive. 
</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Always busy but if you get there for the start of monitoring hours, I was out within 30minutes. East was quicker than west side clinic.

My chief complaint is that he was way too overly optimistic when I first started and, as a consequence, I was extremely shocked by what happened and where I am now. When I went to see him about IVF, he made it seem like a fait-accompli that I would have a baby.  And it all went well -- until it didn't. I had one embryo from my first round that genetically tested normal and implanted.  I miscarried it, and it turned out the fetus had Down's Syndrome. Dr. Grunfeld never communicated to me that PGS was not 100% (I am sure I signed something that said I know). I would have appreciated a little more caution from him and a little more sympathy.  When I went in for my follow up appointment, he didn't remember that the fetus had Down's and was not prepared.  This was upsetting.  He also urged me to another round which I did.  I got 10 eggs but no PGS-normal embryos. When I went to see him for my next follow-up appointment, he told me to keep going but I could not at that point as my insurance had run out. I then did an IUI where I really felt like an afterthought to him and the clinic. Overall, it was a disappointing experience though I don't really blame Dr. Grunfeld. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Be careful if he is overly optimistic. IVF is not a fail-safe.

When I miscarried my genetically-tested embryo, I felt I could have used a little more sympathy and care from Dr. Grunfeld.

I was a patient at RMA Downtown, a small, intimate office which was very convenient to my home and work. I was able to go in for morning check ups and I could be the first patient seen if I got there right before 7:30. I chose this clinic primarily for insurance reasons and proximity to home and work.  

My husband and I both felt they were very on top of our care. They have their systems in place, we felt they worked like a well oiled machine. They were up  front about our out of pockets costs, which so far have proven accurate (though still waiting for all bills to come through).  The doctor and coordinator were easy to get in touch with, though I tended to communicate with the coordinator directly most of the time. There are periods of intense communication and frequent visits and they all went smoothly. 

RMA is a very big operation and I did have to go to the midtown office several times for any weekend check ups, retrieval and transfer.  Things were fine there though it's much more busy and less comfy as a patient. 

Overall, our experience was overwhelmingly positive and drama free, perhaps because it was brief and free of complications.

She prescribed me ovidrel to treat the cyst. I triggered with hcg. I had a lot of follicles to begin with and responded well (except for the e2 spike, which was fine). I had 31 eggs retrieved, 19 fertilized, 12  made it to freeze.  I then went straight to a frozen embryo transfer for my next cycle.

I had been so worried about missing lots of work, and I ended up not being late once, because if I got to the clinic before it opened (7am), I could literally have my blood drawn and my ultrasound done and be out the door at 7:20. Amazing! They also were very organized and never missed calling me with my instructions, which was an unfounded paranoia of mine. Rma is more impersonal because you rotate doctors and there are so many patients, but it seemed to me that they have a system that works. I think if you arrive later in the window of hours for monitoring, you probably end up with a long wait.  That happened to me once on the weekend, but at least I expected it. They really move quickly though. At rma, I definitely didn't have that feeling of knowing the nurses well, even though I went in all the time. They didn't really know me by name.

Our first cycle was stopped as I was told my eggs weren't developing as a ""cohort"".  Two eggs were ""racing ahead of the pack"" and Dr. Lederman felt like due to my age and health, we could do better. It was converted to an IUI where I had a negative home pregnancy test and the dr's office had a low positive (chemical pregnancy most likely).
2) Once I got my period I was put on birth control (pill) for about 2.5 weeks and then started hormone injections again.  It took longer than anticipated before they did the egg retrieval (we were told about 10 days, it was 14 before my retrieval). My egg retrieval was extremely painful and I couldn't move and was in the worst pain of my life for several days.  Nobody would prescribe me anything for the pain (various other materials I read online said other patients at other clinics were always sent home with an rx painkiller). I had also been told this procedure is ""painless"". They got 12 eggs, 10 were mature enough to fertilize (ICSI), 8 were successful, 6 grew, and we wound up with 2 the day-of. The doctor who did our transfer, literally as they were wheeling me out of the waiting area and into the transfer room, said ""oh we want to put both back"" so my husband and I didn't really have time to even think about it.  We had been told, for years, that only ONE egg would ever be transferred.
3) This resulted in an ectopic pregnancy and the most difficult time of our lives.  The pregnancy test came back low positive (hcg about 8) so they told me it didn't work.  Then my numbers continued to triple every 2-3 days and make huge jumps.  This whole time I was in for monitoring every 2-3 days where various doctors, who were not my doctor, would tell me they didn't know what was wrong but something definitely was even though my numbers were in the normal range. I was repeatedly told they ""couldn't find it"" (the sac). After a couple weeks of this (getting good new the numbers were rising and then terrible news that they were convinced something was terribly wrong because they couldn't see anything) I was sent to an ultrasound clinic with higher tech machines as, after weeks of torture, my doctors office finally informed me that their machines aren't good enough to see anything that early anyway (!!!!). This place found an ectopic pregnancy in my left tube. I had two shots of methotrexate that evening and we had to stop trying for three months.

He puts up rather well with my many questions that arise from looking at so many sources. I also appreciated that he wasn't pushy about any sort of particular treatment. He very plainly explained the options to us based on our situation. He told us the laid back approach, all the way through the very aggressive approach, the pros and cons of each option, and then let us decide. It doesn't seem to be about money with him - he truly seems to want us to get pregnant with a viable baby, and not just for money or to ""up"" his numbers. I really believe he cares. So far in our treatment he has been right in all of his opinions of what our fertility issues are. We aren't out of the woods yet, but I've been seeing him for just over a year now and we are definitely very close to a viable pregnancy with our own sperm and eggs.

We thought about it, and then asked if it would make sense to do another egg retrieval and try to bank a few more genetically normal embryos before the transfer. (We had several reasons for this). He said that was a great idea, and he recommended highly that we do it, if we were up for it - but he didn't suggest it himself - we brought the subject up to him. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">See my previous statement.

(Ended up in pregnancy - my third, but miscarriage at 6w1d). Rationale was not to use injectables for an IUI cycle, as those tend to result in multiples which is risky. So we just gave my ovaries a little push and it worked! But the embryo was abnormal (tested fetus after miscarriage and was missing part of the 8th chromosome) so IUI didn't seem to be for us. We needed to move on to IVF with genetic testing. 

Egg retrieval #1: 150 gonal F and 2 vials of menopur. Then a few days later added in a 3rd vial of menopur and also gonarelix. Egg retrieval on day 13. 10 eggs/8 mature/5 fertilized/1 made it to day 6/0 tested genetically normal. :(

Egg retrieval #2: 225 gonal F and 2 vials of menopur. Then a few days later added in a 3rd vial of menopur and also gonarelix. Egg retrieval on day 14. 24 eggs/20 mature/17 fertilized/6 made it to day 6/2 tested genetically normal (grades CB and DA). Rationale was to try and get more eggs than the first retrieval - which worked, and gave us at least a few ""normal"" ones. 

Decision as to whether we should transfer one of the ""normal"" embryos, or if we should try to bank a few more ""normal"" embryos before a transfer. Opted to bank.

Egg retrieval #3: 200 gonal F and 2 vials of menopur. Then a few days later added in a 3rd vial of menopur and also gonarelix. Egg retrieval on day 14. 10 eggs/10 mature/8 fertilized/5 made it to day 6/3 tested genetically normal (grades AB, BB, BC). Rationale was to get better quality eggs, rather than quantity. It worked! This was by far my best cycle in terms of embryology results. At this point we had 5 ""normal"" embryos frozen (although he said the DA looked really bad - and in all his years of doing this he's only seen a viable pregnancy with a D embryo twice. 

Transfer #1: 2 mg estrace taken twice a day. A few days later upped it to 2 mg of estrace three times a day. 5 days before transfer started 50 mg progesterone intramuscular shot once a day/16 mg Medrol for 7 days/1000 mg Azithromycen once. Transfer of BB embryo that thawed to an AA embryo. Lining was at 10mm. Resulted in positive pregnancy test (my 4th) but it didn't stick. Doctor said this was a fluke or bad luck that it didn't work - that with a genetically ""normal"" AA embryo with 10mm lining (and nothing else structurally wrong with me) this should have worked. 

Transfer #2: Same protocol as above, however upped to 75 mg progesterone when mine tested slightly low. Transfer of AB embryo that thawed the same. Lining was at 9mm. This one worked! (My fifth pregnancy). As of this writing I'm almost 16 weeks pregnant.

This has its benefits, but for me, it seemed to have more drawbacks.  I never spoke directly with Dr. Sandler when I had a question or corner, nor did I have contact information for a specific nurse or assistant.  Each time I called I would have to give a brief overview of my history and a different person would contact me.  There were times when I was given two different answers to the same question and had to navigate very confusing waters with little direction.  Everyone was nice enough, but many times I felt that the person I was dealing with was not looking at me as a human, with very complicated emotions surrounding infertility and the treatments I was going through. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">We started with three cycles of IUI using the pill Letrozol and Ovidrel for the trigger shot. I was told each time I went for monitoring that I was responding well to the medication, but got a negative result each time.  I don't recall having any side effects from the Letrozol. I bruised at the injection site from the Ovidrel (but I bruise easily in general). Then we moved on to a traditional IVF cycle.  We used Follistim, Menopur, Cetrotide, and Ovidrel again for the trigger shot.  Giving the shots to myself wasn't as bad as I expected.  I bruised at the injection sites (which you should try to vary as much as possible to avoid injuring the same spot repeatedly) and was sometimes red and irritated as well.  I had a very ""full"" feeling with the injections (which I was told was normal bloating) and was sometimes uncomfortable for a few minutes after each shot (mostly with the Menopur and Cetrotide).  We got 9 eggs from this cycle, and at the time were told this was a good number.  Unfortunately, only 4 fertilized with ICSI (my husband had testicular cancer in 2013 so they did this because of his medical history) and by the time day 5 came around for the transfer only one was left (it was not at blastocyst stage yet, but they transferred it because it was all that we had and said there was still a chance that we could get pregnant).  We did not, however.  When we met with Dr. Sandler for a follow-up we were told that 9 eggs was not really a good number (not sure why we were told at the time that it was) and for someone my age and without any other obvious health issues they would have expected more (a doctor we saw before beginning this whole process brought up the idea of endometriosis but Dr. Sandler felt strongly that he did not need to investigate this further).  We were also told that my right and left ovaries produced a different number of eggs during this cycle.  Dr. Sandler said he would like to see more egg production and more even production between the two ovaries so he recommended another round of IVF but using what they called a ""flare protocol"".  So for IVF round 2, I went on a birth control pill for about 20 days first (this is supposed to shut the whole system down so that when the injections begin, the system is ""flared"" up and made to produce more eggs and with evenness between the ovaries).  Then I did injections again, but this time using Lupron, Follistim, Menopur and then Ovidrel for the trigger shot.  This time 13 eggs were retrieved, 8 fertilized with ICSI and 3 remained at the time of transfer.  Dr. Sandler recommended that we transfer two embryos (this time they made it to the blastocyst stage) so we did.  The third was allowed to mature another day and was frozen on day 6.  I should also mention that with all rounds I also used Medrol, Endometrin, and Prometrium after the transfers (I also took a single dose of an antibiotic with each round).  Again, we got a negative pregnancy test.  We met with Dr. Sandler again and were told that the one embryo that was frozen made it to a very good stage (all embryos are given a rating based on their development) and he recommended that we transfer that frozen embryo.  So we did.  I took Estradiol and then used the same progesterone as with the fresh transfers.  Again, a negative pregnancy test.  We used all of our available insurance benefits and also paid a lot of money out of pocket with Dr. Sandler.  So after many failed attempts we decided to try a different doctor just to have a fresh set of eyes look at our case. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">With the exception of one nurse, they were generally very quick to give information and sometimes I felt like I was being rushed off the phone.

He spent a lot of time with us discussing each of the various procedures and the risks/increasing of odds with each added step.   My husband and I appreciated that he was very much an odds guy, he helped us understand what would increase our chances, but without escalating too fast.  He was helpful in assisting us on when to escalate (after 3 months of clomid/letrozol w/trigger shot, we added iui).  

I was frustrated in this process by not having a clear cut diagnosis and thus in my head a clear path to solving  the problem in getting pregnant.  For much of the process, I spent time focusing in trying to figure out what was wrong and not working.  After all the initial tests came back clear and there was anything that was an obvious problem, dr flisser seemed to easily accept the ""unexplained fertility"" diagnosis and really focus on how to get us pregnant.  For my husband, that was great, for me, who really wanted to understand why my body wasn't functioning, it was frustrating.  By the end of the process (9 months later- 3 med cycles, 3 med + IUI cycles, 1 egg retrieval and 1 transfer cycle) and a pregnancy (currently 24weeks), I'm a little more at ease with not having a  diagnosis 

At roughly 8 out of 10 monitoring apts we saw Dr flisser, with the exception of our egg retrieval cycle.  Unfortunately, our first retrieval cycle happened to fall during the Jewish holidays, so we saw him on day one of the cycle, and then he was off on holiday- while not in office, he was monitoring our progress with the staff via email and did adjust a few of my meds as needed.  At the beginning it didn't bother me that I wasn't seeing our dr, as the other drs we saw were reassuring, but as we got closer to the retrieval and I began to realize I wouldn't see him before or for the retrieval I started to freak out.  It seemed a little unsettling to go through the entire egg retrieval process and only see our actual dr once. After speaking with the nurses about my fears, they got in touch with Flisser and he called me with reassurance that he'd been monitoring my case and that in his opinion everything looked great for a good retrieval.  I asked if he could possibly do the retrieval the next day and he said he'd try.   He did end up performing our retrieval, which definitely put me at ease.  

While Dr Flisser, is good at explaining the medical process and odds, he's not the most warm and fuzzy. He's direct when presenting information and results.  You will not be chatting about your weekend plans or laughing at jokes during your apts.  while he will take the time to reassure you if you have doubts, he will not be one offering hugs or show much emotion throughout the process.  For me and my husband, we were ok with this and the nurses are incredibly helpful with empathy and emotional breakdowns. 

Overall we were happy to have Dr Flisser on our team during this incredibly stressful process full of no guarantees and lots of uncertainty.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I would advise you to ask questions about the process.  Fertility doctors go through these procedures 100s of times a day and often forget that we as patients don't know the process and have fears (not to mention that the meds we're on make us an emotional wreck)   If you have questions or concerns, speak up and ask.  Due to the nature of the practice, there is always a ton of people in office and the actual monitoring is very quick, so it sometimes feels rushed, but if you have questions and concerns and ask, Flisser will stop and take the time to answer them thoughtfully.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">dr flisser was very direct with the medical information and took the time to explain to us the process, and options, and what he thought was the issue, unfortunately didn't have a clear cut diagnosis, but the catch all ""unexplained infertility"".  However, he's not the most warm and fuzzy- he's not going to tell jokes and give hugs, but if you're someone who needs to be completely in the loop of the medical knowledge and the process, he'll make sure that happens. Also, the nature of the RMA practice, it's a little like a casting call, does add to the feeling of being a ""number""</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">As I'm under 30 and was having irregular cycles, with no other medical tests pointing to any other fertility issues, we started with clomid.  After the clomid didn't seem to regulate my cycles, we switched to letrozole. 

 After 3 cycles of letrozole at various dosages with no success, Flisser discussed with us other options and helped us settle on adding IUI.   He didn't feel at that point we needed to jump into the invasive process of IVF as due to our age, time was not of an essence.  

After 3 failed IUI cycles and a diagnosis of ""unexplained infertility,"" we again discussed our options.  While, Flisser said there is no medical reason that the IUI wouldn't probably eventually work and that due to our age, we didn't need to rush, he advised that if we moved to IVF we might have success sooner.  In our age group, he's had great success with very few retrieval and transfer cycles (that often there's some unexplained reason why the fertilized egg doesn't mesh correctly, but once embryos are made , the success rate is strong).  Using this information, we decided to  move onto IVF, with PGD (this would confirm that all implanted embryos would be potentially viable).  

We used the antagonist protocol.   We had 25 eggs retrieved, 17 were fertilized, 5 made to freezing at day 5, and 4 passed the PGD testing. With those results, we decided to move forward with the transfer. 

In good news, I'm currently 24weeks pregnant off of our first transfer.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">We were assigned Marlene as our IVF coordinator.  Her job was to help us have a rough schedule, get prescriptions/refills to the pharmacy of our choice, and answer scheduling questions about each part in the procedure.  She was easily reachable by email and was prompt with replying to emails with questions about meds, protocol, and scheduling.  

Most of the nursing staff was incredibly pleasant and understanding and as always there are some standouts.   

Alyssa, was incredibly helpful to me- she's part of the team that you can meet with after monitoring apts for those questions you think of after the dr leaves the room and relaying the instructions after the dr has reviewed the lab work.   She was always compassionate when I felt overwhelmed by the process and was always through when answering questions.  She was also incredibly prompt when responding to emails.

Another standout nurse was Chanel.  She learned my name quickly and always greeted me with a smile and hello and a quick chat.   It was also reassuring to see her familiar face not only in the monitoring apts, but also on the surgical floor with the egg retrieval and transfer.  She just genuinely cared about her patients and making them feel human in a process that is overwhelming and can often make you feel like a number.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Clinic strengths: it's all inclusive and at one location (monitoring, transfer, retrievals are all at the same location).  The clinic can help you with financing and recommending programs to get discounts.  Also, by having so many drs, they're open every day but Christmas which is important with a process so time sensitive. 

Weaknesses: sometimes you do just feel like a number- there are so many women in and out and you see them all so you realize how many people are being treated by the practice.  Because there are so many doctors, you sometimes see one once and never again. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The monitoring hours were first come first serve from 7-8:30am.  Depending on the day of the week and the time you arrived, it could be a quick wait or it could be a never ending line.  On average I would say wed be seen within 20min of arrival and check in.  

Although there were often people waiting, the clinic was efficient with their process of moving people through lab work and ultrasounds as quickly as possible.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Ultrasound monitoring- $275

He was not particularly encouraging based on my high FSH numbers and low antral follicle count.  He was not willing to proceed with retrieval with a low number of follicles ,  which for me seem to be inevitable and with a different doctor at anotehr clinic, l I was able to proceed even though I had only produced four or five follicles and I had a successful pregnancy based on that procedure .  With Flisser there was also a whole situation where he thought I had an ectopic pregnancy  and was recommending that I have a shot to induce a chemical abortion .  I was certain that it was not ectopic but merely a blighted ovum which I had experienced in the past, and knew the symptoms of. I didn't want to take the pill because it would delay our next IVF cycle for several months, which is a bigger headache than it sounds like given the proliferation of days the clinic is closed in January, not to mention the very strong ticking of my biological clock given the DOR.

In the end, I did not take the shot against his advice and it turned out it was not an ectopic but merely a blighted ovum as I had suspected.  

I think Flisser was erring on the side of caution, but this whole situation really left a bad taste in my mouth. He wasn't physically there for the after-hours appointment where the nurse was trying to push the abortion shot on me. He did, however, talk to me on the phone about it, which I suppose is generous of him. 

But in general, the situation made me feel like maybe fertility doctors like him aren't experts in early pregnancy in which case they should really refer patients to someone else instead of trying to diagnose things that are not within their realm of expertise.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response""> Leave RMA quickly unless you have really simple problems.

I wasn't really planning on doing another IVF cycle, but I agreed to go for a consultation with him. At that first meeting, he was able to tell me why he thought the first cycle didn't work, and what he would do differently. He seemed sure that he could get me pregnant. 

We ended up doing several cycles with him. Each time something didn't work, he tweaked. I thought he would want us to go to donor egg after the first failed cycle, but he didn't. The fact that I had low ovarian reserves didn't scare him, and he was willing to keep trying new protocols. 

In the end, we ended up using donor eggs because our chances with my eggs was too low. But it was a decision my husband and I made with Dr Copperman, and neither one of us felt that it was a rushed decision or something that was done because he was afraid of negative results lowering the clinics score.

Birth Control Pills to shut off my natural cycle, then low dose of lupron. Follistrum and menopure were used to stimulate ovaries. Trigger shot of orvidrel. This cycle was cancelled prior to retrieval, because I only had one follicle. It was suspected that the birth control pills suppressed me too much. 

2nd cycle - antagonist with Clomid added. This was my best cycle  - 6 eggs retrieved, 4 fertilized. We transferred 2 good quality 3 day embryos. I got pregnant with a singleton, but ended up loosing the baby at 25 weeks gestation due to early onset preeclampsia and growth restriction. 

3rd cycle - antagonist with clomid. 2 eggs retrieved, 1mature. Nothing fertilized.

Weakness - the Manhattan clinic is busy, and you can wait a while for monitoring. You don't see you doctor unless he happens to be in the office on a day you are scheduled to come in.

Dr Mukherjee was very cheerful and seemed right at the edge of all the research I had done myself. He recommended we start with the medication I had read about for my specific problem. I'm an info-seeker so I continued to pore over my lab results and find new research about specific numbers and factors. I emailed the doctor a couple times with articles that concerned me, and it was clear he had accounted for that data and could explain what applied and did not apply in my case. He was reassuring but trustworthy, in my opinion, and didn't seem overly confident. Just enough that I could get through and feel like ""of course SOMETHING will work, just a matter of finding what will"". </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Do a lot of research beforehand and if you have a question in the moment ask it, don't wait for it to be answered, especially if you think what he said was ambiguous or contradictory or anything like that.

And besides, you're likely paying good money for this, so get your money's worth. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">It's a busy practice and they have limited time to spend with each patient. At the same time, everyone was friendly and courteous and all my questions were answered. Dr Mukherjee replied to my emails quickly and with a meaningful response. The treatment prescribed was not working and I was becoming increasingly frustrated. He was surprised it wasn't working (so, honest) but still thinking of the next step and never gave me a sense of doom. As it turns out the one cycle I did with him worked, so that may give me rose-colored glasses. But overall it was a positive and warm experience which felt more human than ""factory line"". </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Because I have irregular cycles and anovulation, we needed to control the flow of hormones in my follicular phase so that one or more matured appropriately. Because I have PCOS, we also needed to be careful not to stimulate the growth of too many follicles at once. 

Clomid is often prescribed as a first line of treatment to encourage the growth of at least one follicle. In my case, since I have so many follicles on each ovary from having PCOS, I had researched and Dr Mukherjee recommended Femara (Letrozole) which is better at producing a single mature follicle. On Day 4 of my cycle (because it happened to fall on the day of my appointment and he gave me the prescription right then and there, though CD 3 is more common) I started taking Femara pills and took them for 5 days. 

The next step was to return to the office to monitor the growth of my follicles. They were hardly growing, which was unexpected. He instructed me to restart the Femara for another 5 days. Another monitoring appointment, a little growth, but not enough. He said another 5 days of Femara, and alluded to trying injectables next time if this cycle didn't work (meaning either that the cycle was cancelled and no IUI was performed, or an IUI was performed and no pregnancy/live birth resulted). 

The 3rd round of Femara--still in one cycle--nudged two follicles just enough that he decided we could go ahead and do a trigger shot of Ovidrel to ensure I would ovulate when expected and do the IUI about 36 hours later. I gave myself the Ovidrel shot at home on a Sunday night. 
 
Tuesday morning (2 days after Ovidrel shot) I had my IUI and two Saturdays later I got a positive home pregnancy test. I did blood work at the practice with the nurses and my beta HCG and progesterone levels were very good. I repeated the blood work several times before I could have my ultrasound. Around 5-6 weeks pregnant I had my ultrasound with a different doctor and he found two gestational sacs and yolk sacs. A week or two later I had another ultrasound and they found heartbeats, fetal poles, etc. and I was released to my OB/Gyn. Dr Mukherjee recommended a specific Maternal Fetal Medicine practice that he regarded highly for multiples (i.e. twins +). 
</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The main cost was monitoring visits which were about $250 I think, and the IUI itself. Once I was pregnant, the bloodwork was covered by insurance.

I never had to check in at the front desk, because the office manager knew me immediately and would let them know I was there.

The nurses were great, and were very compassionate when a cycle didn't work.  They were also very happy when a cycle did work.  They would hug us as we graduated to our OB.  

Dr. Lederman was the only doctor that I dealt with (there were a few times that I had to have a transfer or a retrieval done by someone else).  He would call with results and would sit with us after a cycle didn't work.  He was willing to work with me and listen to my ideas about what I could do differently.  

As someone who suffered through so many rounds of fertility treatments, I did a lot of internet research.  I would also ask Dr. Lederman what he thought about the latest thing that I read about.  Instead of making me feel like an idiot or just dismissing it, he would listen and encourage me to do what I felt would make me feel better.  I'm not saying that trying the things I read on the internet helped, but if nothing else, they may have put my mind in the right place.

Menopur - used in all cycles
Follistim - used in all cycles
Lupron - used in all cycles
Ganirelix  - used after first cycle due to not using birth control pills ( I have an adverse reaction to birth control pills)
PIO Shots - Used after first 2 cycles due to having better results
Progesterone Suppositories - used in first 2 cycles
Doxycycline - used in all cycles
Medrol - used in all cycles
Metformin - Used after 1st cycle to help with my PCO tendencies

I also suggested taking a baby aspirin and Dr. Lederman included that in my regimen.  

Our first cycle produced very few embryos, due to the eggs be polyspermy.  Dr. Lederman suggested that we use ICSI to eliminate this happening again.  I was able to get pregnant with a singleton on my second cycle and I gave birth to my son.

When my son was 6 months old I started trying again to get pregnant.  I had a very hard time.  I had 2 chemical pregnancies.  Dr. Lederman suggested that we have the embryos tested with PGS after that so that we could ensure that the embryos were were using were viable.  We did one last cycle with Dr. Lederman to retrieve eggs and do a fresh transfer.  Dr. Lederman's group had just been bough by RMA at the time and they had a different protocol for the embryos that was having better results.  We were able to get 5 embryos from that retrieval that were viable after the PGS testing on the 5th day.  We did 3 transfers that didn't work, with single embryos.  Our last transfer we put back the 2 remaining embryos and I was pregnant with twins.

They would be really happy for you if you got a positive outcome.

He was referred to me by a few friends / acquaintances who had positive views of him and his practice. 
 
When my first round of IVF did not yield a large number of eggs / embryos, his adjustments for and throughout the second round showed far better results.  A third attempt may have been even more promising, but we ultimately chose to move on. 

In Dr. Stein's practice, there is not a lot of focus on preparation before cycles or treatment. There was very little advice on nutritional adjustments or supplements. For me, personally, I was looking for more guidance on how to possibly improve my situation from an integrative medicine perspective before jumping into another cycle. 

That said, as far as western medicine, I would recommend him to those that are focused on that kind of treatment.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">If you have questions, continue to ask them. He can be responsive by email. If not, his office will set up a phone consult. 

He is direct and extremely knowledgeable, but I am not sure how much he thinks outside the box. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">While Dr. Stein is very approachable and willing to answer questions by email, phone or appointment, he does have a very large number of clients (as you would expect from RMA NY). I did not always see him during monitoring and when I did, time was often limited. 

Also, while he was very good about tempering expectations, I felt there was a lot of emphasis on only my age and not further exploration of other contributing factors.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">In my first IVF cycle, we used the microflare protocol that starts with the birth control pill. Given my work schedule, I was on bcp for a week longer than standard. I had fears that this would over-suppress my ovaries. I wholeheartedly believe that my fears were valid. The amount of eggs retrieved did not match my expectations given antral follicle count from several day 3 observations. Trust your instincts!!

My second IVF cycle, using estrogen priming, yielded far more eggs. However, we opted for PGD and none of our embryos made it to blast even though they made it to day 5. Given my history of miscarriage, it was the right choice to try to test all the embryos at the time. However, for the next cycle, we will try to transfer some fresh embryos.

After speaking to a couple friends that were also patients of Dr. Stein, it seems that we were all started with the microflare protocol. Personally understanding the variations of our circumstances, ages and fertility issues, I am not sure that starting all of us on the same protocol shows much consideration for individual situations. Of course, we don't know if he does this for all patients but it is interesting to note.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The nursing staff was good. Given the volume of patients, I did not always speak to my primary nurse. I don't even remember her name. They were knowledgeable and responsive but I did not feel like I got focused care.

I was passed between 2 coordinators. So, I never felt that I had direct care as there was always confusion as to which of the 2 should or could respond to me. Again, this took away from focused care.

My best experience was with one of the nurses that drew my blood. Whenever, she was there, she knew my name and expressed compassion. Unfortunately, there were also nurses that drew my blood that were more interested in discussing their weekend plans with other staff than giving me their full attention. 

If you go to RMA, make sure they are clear who is your primary nurse and your primary coordinator.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">RMA has a good reputation, but they have such a high volume of patients, it's almost impossible to get the fully focused care that you deserve during this process. 

The billing department could use improvement with respect to organization and communication. Given the importance of removing stress during fertility treatments, worrying about billing issues is counterproductive to the process. Get to know your billing coordinator and stay on top of them.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Monitoring appointments are only from 7 AM - 9 AM on weekdays. If your monitoring appointment falls on a weekend, you have to go the Eastside office with similar hours.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Standard costs. Other responses here are accurate.

Once all results were back we went back in to meet with Dr. Stein to discuss our options.

We decided to move forward with IUI per his recommendation as he did not think we needed to start with anything too invasive at first, planning to do three rounds before reassessing our options.

Dr. Stein performed our first IUI procedure, and did so clearly explaining each step, and injecting just the right amount of humor into it all to help us feel more relaxed! 

When our third attempt didn't work, we did one more round of IUI while we waited for our appointment with Dr. Stein to discuss what to do next. 

After our fourth IUI procedure, before it was time to take a pregnancy test, we had our follow up with Dr. Stein to discuss next steps. He went over the entire IVF process. We left that appointment feeling hopeful and excited to get that next process started. We felt that we were in the best hands. I was more relaxed after that meeting than I had been since before we initially met with him to start IUI... perhaps that is what helped lead to a positive pregnancy test with our fourth IUI cycle!

IUI requires a few visits to the office each cycle - blood work, follicle monitoring, and the actual IUI procedure itself (you both need to go in that day!). Dr. Stein performed our first IUI procedure, and did so clearly explaining each step, and injecting just the right amount of humor into it all to help us feel more relaxed! While we did not necessarily see Dr. Stein or Eliza at all of those appointments over the three months, we felt very comfortable and in great hands with the doctors and nurses we did see. 

When we had an unsuccessful third IUI attempt, we were obviously upset and disappointed. I spoke with Eliza, who was the support I needed at the time, as I did not know what to do next as I was so accustomed to going in for day 1 blood work to start my next IUI cycle. As our follow up appointment with Dr. Stein was not for another two weeks, she suggested that my husband and I consider trying just one more time so we did not have to spend two weeks just waiting around.

He suggested three IUI cycles. When the three did not work, we met with him to discuss our next options - in the meantime we were in the middle of trying a fourth time as our appointment with Dr. Stein was not for another two weeks after the third failed attempt. He explained that our next options were either trying IUI for a total of six months (2 more times) or looking into IVF. My husband and I did not want to do two more rounds of IUI, so asked that he explain the IVF process to us.

Our third IVF worked, we are now 17 weeks pregnant and we couldn’t be any happier! I'll be honest: this journey was certainly never easy. There were sad and frustrating times but we definitely made the right decision by trusting Dr. Stein and sticking with him and the team at RMA.

Throughout our process, we learned that there are many reasons that your treatments can go wrong; infertility treatment is never an exact science, and Dr. Stein was always candid with us about what he could control and couldn’t control. In our cases, we found out that we had PCOS, endometriosis, chronic endometritis, and a chromosome issue as treatments go. We needed a few attempts to find the best protocol for our particular situation. Given the difficulties of our case, I don’t think we could have gotten our successful results as relatively soon as we did if we had switched doctors midstream.

On a practical note, it was very helpful that monitoring visits (to check blood levels, etc.) take place in the morning. The visits were always efficient and I was never late to work. We also received a follow-up call and instructions promptly on the same day.  Dr. Stein and on-duty nurses/doctors were also quick to answer my emails whenever I had questions or concerns. 

My advice to any couples considering infertility treatment is to take the time necessary to do your own research and ask lots of questions to your doctor. At RMA, our experience was that Dr. Stein would always listen to and answer our questions, even if our concerns or anxieties were more internet-based than evidence-based :-). Make sure you understand the treatment and protocols that are recommended, and why it is that a doctor believes that a given protocol is the best course of action for your individual situation.

Overall we had a very positive experience working with Dr. Daniel Stein and enthusiastically recommend him and the team at RMA.

Based on this initial assessment, we proceeded with an antagonist protocol. During the first retrieval, we successfully retrieved 17 eggs and created four embryos. Of those four, only one came back with a normal assessment form the PGS testing.

The second retrieval was a failure because the dosage of the trigger shot was too low (instructed by the doctor on call, not Dr. Stein).

The third retrieval yielded 21 eggs and 6 embryos. Based on the PGS assessment then, the doctor discovered we had a potential translocation issue. The doctor spoke with the lab to double-check his hypothesis that we had an instance of balanced translocation - and therefore could proceed to embryo transfer - and was very careful. This time we used OPC/LUPTON OVERLAP protocol and it seemed worked for our case as well.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Overall nursed at RMA were very helpful in answering questions.

Throughout my time under his care he always listened, gave his honest opinion and provided options without ever pushing me, which I really appreciated. I was hesitant to jump into any intense treatments so we started with timed intercourse followed by IUIs. I got pregnant within a few months, but it turned out to be an ectopic resulting in emergency surgery to remove my fallopian tube. My husband and I will never forget how amazing Dr Reichman was throughout the whole experience. On a Friday evening, he rushed to meet us at the ER and canceled his own plans for the night so that he could be there with us and perform the surgery himself. This was not something he had to do - and I knew other doctors wouldn't - but that's how much he cares about his patients. He turned a traumatic situation into something much more bearable and assured us this would not prevent me from becoming pregnant. Given how painful the fertility journey can be, we couldn't imagine getting through it without a doctor who cared as much as he did. Even after this experience (and another miscarriage) he didn't push me into IVF until I felt ready, even though he knew it would give us our best chance of success. Of course he was right, and I got pregnant from my first transfer (which he performed.) We trusted him throughout the entire process and he never steered us wrong. We felt incredibly lucky to be under his care and will never be able to thank him enough for everything. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Trust what he says. He truly cares about you as a patient and person and knows what he is doing.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Regardless of the many patients under his care, Dr Reichman remembered every detail of my case. He was always patient, answering all of my questions and calming my fears. He would consistently ask how my husband and I were doing, and was genuinly concerned about the emotional toll that my last miscarriage took on us (which was the result of natural conception, before we followed his recommendation to try IVF with genetically tested embryos).  In every interaction, it was obvious he cared about us as people and understood how trying this process can be. He also brought some much-needed levity that we always appreciated. 

Additionally, I can't say enough wonderful things about his office staff. The receptionists knew me by name and the nurses always greeted us with a smile no matter how early it was or how many patients were waiting. This makes all of the difference when you're starting so many of your days there.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Since I am fairly young, had gotten pregnant once before, and testing showed no concerns with my health or my husband's, we started with timed intercourse then moved on to try two IUIs. We attempted a third IUI with Clomid but canceled once Dr Reichman saw I was ovulating on my left side where my fallopian tube had been removed. I ended up getting pregnant naturally but it resulted in another miscarriage, after which we finally took Dr Reichman's advice and turned to IVF. He was confident that my recurring losses were due to genetically abnormal embryos so he recommended PGS testing, which was the best call - we should have listened sooner. For my retreival we used Gonal-F, Menepur and Ganirelix and I was monitored very closely throughout the whole cycle. Dr Reichman got us great results, but unfortunately after PGS we had high attrition and were left with only 2 normal embryos. He recommended we move forward with another retrieval which wasn't what we planned, but we talked it through and he felt it would serve us better in the long run to start with more embryos so we could alleviate some pressure, and he was right. We got amazing results from my second retreival (same protocol) and we were able to move forward with a transfer soon after (natrual cycle with a frozen day 5 embryo), which was successful.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Christine was fantastic. She always called with my results, returned emails and phone calls very promptly, and answered all of my many questions without making me feel crazy (I was an anxious patient!) She went out of her way to make sure we always had what we needed in terms of meds, and seemed genuinly happy for us whenever we got good news. I loved her upbeat and positive personality.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">We loved the Tribeca office. It was a 5 minute walk from my office which was huge, but I would have traveled much further for the care I received there. Every team member, whether it be a receptionist or nurse, was always patient and kind which makes a big difference when you are struggling with infertility and have to trek in so often. It was never lost on me how hard they work and how many vulerable and anxious patients they deal with all day, and yet they were still always so pleasant. I had to go to the UES location a couple of times on weekends and it made me appreciate Tribeca even more, which feels much more intimate and way less overwhelming.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Very well organized, which was always surprising to me given how busy the waiting room could get.

Dr Reichman also seemed genuinely invested in the outcome of my treatment and my comfort during the process. He goes above and beyond for his patients. He concluded I needed surgery for a fibroid and referred me to a high-profile surgeon at a NYC different hospital. I was crushed to learn the surgeon had a 3 month wait just for a consult; my biological clock was ticking loudly in the background! Dr Reichman personally went out of his way to help me get an appointment with the surgeon 10 days later, and then later high-fived me happily when my post-surgery ultrasound revealed the operation had been a huge success. Prior to that, we had a disappointing outcome with an embryo retrieval, and Dr Reichman called us himself and delivered the news with the perfect balance of no-nonsense, compassion, and optimism about our future.

These were the same drugs that I used at a previous clinic with two other Drs, but Dr Reichman seemed more up to date than the other Drs were with various testing methods, clinical trials, etc. The treatment with Dr Reichman felt more cutting edge. He is very informed, he listens to your goals and puts together a great state-of-the-art plan just for you. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The nursing staff and front desk staff are all terrific.

Our main nurse Christine is a so kind, reassuring, and extremely organized. She always answered my emailed questions quickly and set my mind at ease. I was always so happy to see her at the practice. 
With all the required consent forms and appointments, IVF entails quite a bit of admin which can be burdensome during an already stressful process. The Cornell team is a well-oiled machine, and kept me on track with my medications, visits, etc. Sounds like a small thing but it's extremely helpful. Our previous clinic was disorganized and it was SO frustrating and wasted so much time and energy. 
The Tribeca front desk staff is also extremely kind and knew me by name. They all seem genuinely delighted when my FET was a success, which made that happy appointment feel even more special.

He was optimistic with my case from the beginning, even when I felt pessimistic. I had come to see him having just experienced my very first pregnancy, which became a miscarriage at 10 weeks. I was emotional but had my heart set on doing everything possible to becoming pregnant again. I micromanaged him. I wanted to handle every aspect of my journey, from the IVF protocols to the timing of transfer. I second guessed his nurses constantly. I emailed Dr. Reichman incessantly with compromises, worries, and left-field inquiries. He almost always answered in detail, which is something that I have yet to come across in other NYC physicians who are as busy as he is. He did not have unlimited patience, but he was always willing to sit down and touch base with us to alleviate fears, or to set our patient-physician relationship back on track after an argument.
</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Advocate for yourself. Dr. Reichman is incredibly smart. If your requests are substantiated, he will compromise with you on reasonable grounds.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The Tribeca office staff always remembered my name, and Dr. Reichman kept detailed notes on my case.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">
We dove straight into IVF due to my diminished ovarian reserve. Dr. Reichman had pitched starting with IUI/letrozole, but he supported my more aggressive choice. I insisted on a natural start, resulting in 8 retrieved, 5 fertilized, and 4 frozen. We did not PGS test. The second cycle, he proposed using BCP. I was afraid of being oversuppressed and did not want to try this modification, but he assured me it would give good results. Unfortunately, I developed a lead follicle and he canceled that cycle. The third cycle, he proposed estrogen priming. I also fought him on this. Although I had 7 follicles going into retrieval, only 2 were retrieved. Both were alive at day 6, frozen, and confirmed to be PGS normal. 

I took some time off after the last cycle to undergo several back to back surgeries. In January of 2019, I insisted Dr. Reichman raise a request to the embryology lab for them to transfer the second-best graded frozen embryo in my batch. That FET resulted in my current pregnancy - I am due in three weeks.

</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Hannah was Dr. Reichman's nurse, whom I worked with before she went out on maternity leave. She was always cheerful and willing to help, but in most cases she did not know the extent of my discussions with Dr. Reichman, so I preferred to speak directly with the doctor.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Weill Cornell Tribeca - biggest pro is that the physician performs the monitoring ultrasounds. I was able to see Dr. Reichman at almost every single monitoring appointment during the week. In addition, the clinic is clean, and the calls from nurses during the cycle are consistent and organized. Front desk is very friendly. I chose this clinic due to early monitoring hours before work, and the fact that it was a 5 minute walk from my apartment.

Weakness: you do not get to see your doctor on weekends and holidays unless he/she happens to be on call. My weekend treks up to the UES office were always much worse experiences (i.e., longer wait times, unfamiliar physicians, and several incompetent nurses).</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">If you are willing to be at the office right at 6:30, there is almost no wait time.

I liked that I don't feel rushed when I asked him questions after ultrasound during monitoring (which could be awkward for some). 
Weakness: I have had 2 failed embryo transfer with him. The last one was devastating as I transferred 2 of my last remaining embryos but I didn't receive any phone call from him. Even just to say, ""sorry it didn't work"". The only call I received was from my nurse that my pregnancy test was negative. I had to do a follow up appointment to speak to him about the next step.

However, the nurse communication/instructions could be better. They have different numbers for appointments, Main office # and nurses. For the nurses, there will not always be someone to pick up your call. You will have to leave a voice message. Although they will call you back before the end of the day when you leave a message, during this stressful journey I feel that having someone answer your phone call (may it be to relay a message) feels more ""human"" or less anxious provoking. Also, sometimes you also gets a voice message thru Dr. Schattman's office. When I leave a message, there is always that thought what if my message get deleted by mistake or the voice mail machine acts up. What now? Just my thought. In terms of their monitoring and appointments, they have a different section for both which I like. You don't feel the crowdedness in the morning during monitoring hours if you have an appointment with your doctor. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I don't know that protocol Dr. Schattman used but he started me with Estrogen patches (after a positive ovulation using ovulation predictor kit) changing it every 2 days, till the 4th patch and getting my period. He then gave me letrozole for 5 days together with follistim/gonal-f and menopur. After a few days on those (I forgot exactly), I needed to get ganirelix to prevent ""maturing"" of my eggs. I had 1-2 that is growing faster than the rest. Then they gave me a Lupron trigger prior to egg retrieval. I have about 24 eggs retrieved with 3 embryos making it to freezing. I had one blastocyst transferred in October 2018 but failed and 2 morulas in April 2018 which also failed. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">My primary nurse at Weill Cornell is very knowledgeable about fertility treatments. Although I had difficulty communicating with them. I feel that since they have many patients, sometimes they could loose their ""patience"". They would always return your phone call but you most times have to leave a message in an answering machine and waiting for their phone call. I also feel that sometimes, they are rushed when you are in the phone with them or in person. This infertility journey is as stressful as it could be and we need someone from our team to be there for us to help us get through his journey. I remember one time during in this clinic during monitoring, the doctor (not my primary doctor) told me to give ganirelix since some of my eggs are growing faster than the rest. I thought she would repeat the instructions before leaving. I didn't ask again, I thought I could just ask a nurse. I went and asked for a nurse but the nurse (not my primary nurse) told me, if the doctor told you to do it, do it; ""nothing yet is written in your file so I don't know what the doctor said"". I left and cried but went back to the doctor that did the monitoring. This could have been avoided if the nurse just had asked the doctor what was said! As a nurse myself, I try to bridge that gap between the patient &amp; the doctor. If something was not clear to the patient, I will make sure and even take ""strides"" to ask the doctor about the plan of care. I also feel that they could have an email sent to patients for ""instructions"" during monitoring as to avoid confusions. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Strengths: clinic physically is clean and spacious. They have a separate area for doctor's appointment and during ""monitoring hours"". During monitoring hours, They also have a ""card"" system where you just swipe your card and let them know you have arrived. You don't have to fall in line to ""register"". The egg retrieval and embryo transfer are done in a hospital setting. What I also like it that they have a ""pre-op"" class prior to the egg retrieval, they check your labs, vitals"". 
Weakness: Speaking to billing might not be private. Clinic could get crowded during the monitoring hours. Some receptionist in the front could be more friendlier. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Weill Cornell's monitoring hours was from 6:30 am-8 am so it was convenient for me. I will still be late for work since I start 7 am but I will just have to come to the clinic at 6:30 or earlier. It is a well oiled machined will lots of people taking blood so we move quickly. Dr. Schattman will also try to see me during monitoring hours for the ultrasounds which I liked since it also gives me opportunity to ask him questions. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">for regular appointments with Dr. Schattman, I only paid my copay with my insurance. 
For IVF cycle, please be advised that this clinic might be more expensive that the others. 
their IVF cycle for 1 fresh transfer: 10,500
for any frozen embryo transfer: $ 4,260
ICSI: $ 2, 630
Cryopreservation: $ 1,050 (storage $ 262. 50/quarterly); 1st 6 months waived
Anesthesia fee varies if your insurance covers it but they have a facility fee $ 1005.84 during the day of egg retrieval which is an additional expense. 
</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Weill Cornell Reproductive team has a sheet where you can put it who many embryos to transfer. The recommend embryo transfer for my age was only 1 but my second transfer since the embryos are in the morula stage, Dr. Schattman decided two embryos transfer but it also failed. </div>]"

During the first cycle she stated that she thought our previous clinic overstimulated us and she was confident we could have more success with less aggressive medication regimens to stimulate eggs. The first cycle we had 4 embryos, but only 1 was viable on testing. The second cycle was cancelled. However, when we met with her for the next cycle to discuss the treatment plan, she was much colder. We stated that due to insurance, this is our last cycle and we want to optimize it. She looked at us and said, ""well we go into all of our treatment cycles thinking that."" When we asked for advice she wouldn't give us any suggestions and instead said, ""Well what do you want to do?"" I tried giving ideas based off of treatments I heard of through other support groups, online research, friends such as using Clomid on the male, procedures on myself, etc. She shook her head at all of them and said, ""what else are you thinking?"" So finally I responded, ""Well, you are the professional and this is your area of expertise, I'm only telling you the little research I've done, why don't you give us some ideas based on your knowledge?"" She was reluctant to come up with more suggestions but finally agreed to do a check up and after some time came up with a plan. I felt discouraged like I had to do the work on my own.

We traveled from Pennsylvania to New York and it was all worth it. From the moment we had our initial consultation with him he gave us hope and made us feel like he truly cared. 
I have not had an easy journey with fertility - 2 natural pregnancies both ending in miscarriages, being told by a previous RE my lining was too thin and so never even getting to a transfer attempt, retained products of conception after a D&amp;C by my OB. 
But Dr. Reichman never gave up. I remember starting my IVF cycle with him in March 2018 and during a saline sonogram is when he discovered I had retained products of conception and told me he would have to go in and do surgery after I completed the IVF cycle and retrieval. I started crying in the exam room. Dr. Reichman was extremely comforting, telling me ""I am in your corner,"" letting me know that he would take care of me during the surgery as I was worried about my lining, and that together we would get through this and meet our end goal of having a baby. He is an extremely compassionate and caring physician, but he is also a realist - he is very straightforward with what he thinks. This is a quality my husband and I appreciated; we wanted someone who would be direct and honest. Dr. Reichman is always thinking about what is best for his patients; he individualizes every plan of care to each of his patients.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Don't be afraid to ask questions. He answers every single one of them without making you feel rushed or that it's a silly question.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Reichman is an extremely personable physician. He makes his patients feel like they matter. He takes time at every appointment with you, answers every question you have, and does not make you feel rushed. There were a couple times he suggested we set an appointment for a ""strategy meeting"" - his words - which we loved. He knows every detail about his patients. He remembers everything, even asking about how our trip to Chicago was when we had a follow-up appointment with him. 
His front-desk staff are the nicest and sweetest team members. They remember your name, ask how you're doing, and are always on top of everything.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I was on Gonal-F, Menopur, and Cetrotide, with an HCG trigger shot before the egg retrieval. I can't remember the exact dosages but he had me on a low dose of Gonal-F. I only had 5 antral follicles. We retrieved 5 eggs, all 5 fertilized, 3 made it to PGS testing and all 3 were PGS normal! We did not expect this and were thrilled, as my last miscarriage was confirmed due to chromosome issues.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">My primary nurse that I communicated with was Hannah. She always showed compassion during every interaction or phone call. She answered every question and made  sure you understood your directions and next steps before hanging up the phone. Even when meeting in person about something Hannah never rushed you and was very thorough in her care and explanations. She also replied very timely to emails.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Weill Cornell Reproductive Medicine is a top center for infertility. As I said we traveled from PA to NY to be a patient and it was worth it in every way. I only wish we had done this from the beginning instead of wasting a year with a different RE in PA. 
Dr. Reichman's Tribeca office is absolutely wonderful. The office seems newer with state-of-the-art equipment and the most friendly staff. His staff are extremely helpful, especially if you need support dealing with prior-auths and insurance - they stepped in and before I knew it everything was handled.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Monitoring appointments were very efficient.

While I had a basic understanding of my diagnosis from doing research on my own prior to my first consult (my OBGYN had completed basic hormone level testing which indicated severe diminished ovarian reserve and high FSH and referred me to the clinic), looking back I feel that Dr. Spandorfer could have been more specific and blunt about my chances of success doing IVF and using my own eggs.  At no point would he give us an estimated chance at success given my young age and diagnosis.  He explained that while I would likely only produce 2-4 eggs per retrieval, there was a good chance that due to my young age, there was a chance I could produce a good quality egg within that cycle.    As we progressed with treatment and moved on to second and third rounds of IVF, I often found that he would present options (ex: medication protocols) and I would be left to make the decision on which path to choose.  I would have preferred the doctor to have more conviction and state ""we should go with XX option given this will give you your best shot"".

The front desk employees are not overly friendly.  The doctors handing ultrasounds for follicle growth always seemed to be in a rush and I would need to ask questions quickly to get an answer before they left the room for the next patient.  I never had a dedicated nurse assigned to my case while I was a patient.  Every call would be from a different individual which made it difficult if I had questions on my treatment....there was no consistency.  For my egg retrieval and transfer at the hospital, it was one big waiting game.  The room was full of patients and you were filed into the operating room one after the next.  The process was quite long and there was a lot of down time while waiting your turn.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Cycle 1: estrogen priming/antagonist protocol- 300 units Gonal F and 150 units Menopur;  eggs retrieved: 3
Cycle 2: low dose medication protcol with clomid-&amp;gt;  (150 units Gonal F and 75 units Menopur;  meds were eventually bumped up due to lack of response)  we tried this approach given my body will never produce a large amount of follicles and I had been told by other parties that this is a good approach for poor responders/diminished ovarian reserve patients.  This protocol unfortunately did not work at all and I was left stimming for approx. 18 days without any follicles growing past 10mm and cycle was then cancelled.
Cycle 3:  returned to original protocol- estrogen priming/antagonist protocol- 300 units Gonal F and 150 units Menopur;  eggs retrieved: 1</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">This is an area that could be greatly improved upon.  There should be consistency in the person you speak to during an IVF cycle.  I felt like I needed to give color on my case or background information given I was always speaking to a new person.  For my first failed transfer, the lack of compassion I received from the nurse who called to tell me my test was negative was very upsetting.  There was no emotion or feeling of empathy as she spoke to me and the call last all of 2 minutes.  At times nurses had attitudes and made you feel like you were bothering them if you called with a question.  You would always have to leave a voicemail and someone would eventually call you back.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The reputation for this clinic is extremely strong in the NYC area.

I felt like everyone was competent and I was in good hands but often felt like I was being shuffled along due to the amount of patients.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The clinic has the flow down for monitoring appointments and is run efficiently however, there can be long waits due to the number of patients if you decide to go at ""peak time"".

This was the first time that those options had been offered to me and given the fact that i cannot get an embryo to day 5 in a dish this was comforting. We had one initial converastion to make a plan. It was extended and I never felt rushed. I asked him about the reason that nothign ever made it to day 5 in the dish and he said probably egg quality but not necessarily. He is not didactic in his approach to treatment and has been doing this long enough to remember the days before automatically pushing to day 5 blasts and pgs was the norm. We ultimately decided on a freeze all cycle with the plan to do another cycle immediately following which I ended up not doing because I hated the clinic so much. I told him I thought I had been way overmedicated in my previous cycle and he listened and dosed lower as a result. We ended up having a very solid outcome of that cycle with 10 to freeze.

He likes double ganirelix on theses low dose cycles, but I thouht it may have been over-suppressive so i actually just did one and a half ganirelix instead of 2X a day. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I remember Dr. Davis's manager a lot more than his nursing staff.  His office manager was excellent. The way that Cornell organizes their clinic make me so aggravated that I honestly don't think I had a main nurse. You literally never see teh same person twice- nurse or even phlebotomist. They were all.... fine. It really is truly a factory so the nurses respond to the culture that they are a part of and have no power to change. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Let me start by saying that I hated pretty much everything about the way this clinic is run. it is impersonal. It is a factory but not a well oiled machine. All REs love to talk about how their labs are teh best. Literally every single RE will tell you they have the best lab. And while there are some labs that may be better than others in some ways, for the most part i think it's negligible once you get past a certain threshold of care. So I think Cornell hides behind ""we have the best lab"" argument to avoid actually providing quality continuity of care. The waiting room holds 100 people. You check in with a swipe card. It is incredibely impersonal. They do not run on time. When you get called in you will see random blood draw person- i swear I never saw teh same person twice. Then you will be assigned a room and random young dr will do your scan. I seriously had to ask a few of tehm if they were med students or not becuase tehy looked so young, and again, I never saw teh same person twice. This is a problem becuase everyone measures follicles differently and you are relying on their measurements being given to your dr to decide on what next steps are needed. So if you are deciding when to trigger and someone measures either generously or conservatively it can actually have a major impact on your outcome. I hated that I literally never saw Dr. Davis and they drs doing the scans were so clearly like- whatever- about their job. It is a factory. I also really, really have a major issue with how they handle retrievals. First of all, EVERYONE is required to come to a 6am class and sort of group blood work the day before your retrieval even if you have already done multiple retrievals. They come out with a clipboard and the order that your name goes on teh clipboard is the order that you are seen. So you sit around a conference table with all the women who are being retrieved the next day. Too bad about HIPPA and expectations of privacy- there are NONE. You could end up sitting there with your boss, or your sister in law, or your hairdresser. I actually can;t believe it's legal. Then they call yuo back one at a time to do blood and sign forms. I then refused to stay for the class ofw hat to expect becuase this was going to be by 4th or 5th retrieval which I told them. The nurses were not nice about it all and threatened to cancel my cycle if I messed up anything. I was like- you are handing me a piece of  paper with the extensive instructions of what to do. i can read and I will follow them . And then I left. Then the next day I showed up at 6am again- for a 10am retrieval- which is just obnoxious. Then again, you are called by name and given scribs to change into they put the IV in your arm. And then you are put in a waiting room with all the same women AND their partners, parents etc...  in scrubs... with an IV sticking in your arm. And you wait. Again. And then they call you by name in groups of 3 and take you to a tiny waiting room. There one at a time the anethesiologist pulls you into the hallway (i swear) to have a private converastion about any anethesia you may have. I had 2 very lovely girls I was sitting with and we kinda chatted a bit but honestly, what if you don't really want to be in scrubs with strangers having a convo right before your retrieval? Then they take you one at a time and you see whoever is on call for retrievals that day- you may or may not have ever met them. Then you go to recovery. They wake you up with mandatory pain pills and send you on your merry way. They do tell you how many eggs were retrieved and thats it. Having had a a fair amount of clinic experiences by the time I got there I had a lot of comparisons to other clinics and this model is by a loooong shot, my least favorite. I ended up moving my 10 frozen 2PNs to another clinic because I refused to ever cycle with them again. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">100% a cattle call. See above. I walked in one saturday and there were literally 75- 100 people waiting to be seen.

He has always made me and my husband feel our case was important to him, and that he had high hopes and reasonable expectations we would be able to have the family we hoped for. 

Our situation is unique compared to some others as we live in Georgia and chose to first see him for a second opinion until ultimately deciding he was the best doctor for our fertility journey despite the distance. He wanted to try an IUI first given my age (under 35) and once we returned to Georgia after the procedure, I had a very rare reaction. I ended up in the hospital for 5 days with what was later determined to be endometritis, or uterine infection. Despite being so far away from Dr. Rosenwaks, he and his team of fellows were on top of my case, in close contact with my local OB/GYN who was administering my care. Once I was well enough to travel back to NY, he had me come in on a Sunday and had doctors there to see me to ensure my continued recovery. He also sent me to other top notch specialists when there were still concerns with my health that were somewhat out of his wheelhouse. The infection did delay our treatment for a few months but I could not have imagined going through what I went through under anyone else’s care. 

We had other bumps in the road, having to delay our first IVF cycle in Jan. 2020 because of elevated FSH levels. Luckily we were able to start in February, and despite some severe cramping as a result of stimulation, I did get pregnant. Unfortunately, the pregnancy showed a low fetal heartbeat at 7 weeks and ended in miscarriage by 8 weeks. It was devastating, and still is, but Dr. Rosenwaks has truly been here for us, calling to check in on me and giving me as much information as possible about a plan moving forward despite the current COVID-19 crisis. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Rosenwaks is very matter-of-fact about plans and fertility protocols. But he will answer any question you have. Do not hesitate to ask anything you have questions about, or his opinion on something you heard or read. He will be honest about his thoughts. Even though he no longer performs procedures himself, he is the director of the clinic and has put together an incredible staff of doctors, nurses and fellows who have an incredibly high standard to achieve in working with him. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Rosenwaks is incredibly thorough and looks at every detail of your medical history and asks very specific  questions to best understand your case. His entire staff of colleagues, Nurse’s and administrators are truly the best and are a firsthand extension of his dedication and care. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Rosenwaks informed us from the beginning that I may not get very many eggs from the retrieval because of low AMH/ high FSH levels, indicative of somewhat diminished ovarian reserve. I had a day 2 start after being on estrogen patches to suppress my eggs from having ones grow faster than the others because of my high FSH. I stimulated for 12 days on Follistim 300 units, Ganirelix cycle days 9 to 13, HCG trigger 10,000 units day 14. My egg retrieval yielded 4 mature eggs, ICSI, resulting in 3 day 5 blastocyst embryos. We transferred 1 and achieved positive pregnancy test. I was also taking intramuscular progesterone injections until miscarriage. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Katia, Dr. Rosenwaks’ nurse practitioner is without question, an exceptional human. She is truly Dr. Rosenwaks right hand person, and on top of all of his cases. She is compassionate, professional, and caring all at once. She answers every hard question, calls back when she gets the answers from Dr. Rosenwaks that she needs, and is incredible at explaining anything clearly and concusses with patience and understanding of what you are going through, even if she hasn’t experienced it firsthand. 

Wally (Waleska) is Dr. Rosenwaks’ office administrator, and is wonderful in every way. She has been with him for a few decades and is the friendly voice you need when you need to make appointments for leave word for Dr. Rosenwaks.

Last, I could not be more grateful to Jenny. She is the nurse/ ultrasound technician always on hand for appointments with Dr. Rosenwaks and her positivity and support is everything. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Everything about the clinic medically was incredibly organized. From scheduled appointments, to daily monitoring, it was not often we had to wait very long. I only had once instance in morning monitoring with a doctor doing the ultrasound that I felt was subpar (by only a little) to the others. But all results of morning monitoring and how well I was doing during stimulation was still ultimately in Dr. Rosenwaks’ hands.

My greatest grievance with the clinic is how billing is handled. It was ultimately a mess. They tried to tell me multiple times I had 1 IVF cycle covered by insurance. I told them we spoke with my insurance company numerous times and that was not the case. Now we have extensive bills after they submitted through insurance when we should have been considered as a patient paying out of pocket. We are still working on getting this sorted out. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Often times lots of people waiting during morning monitoring hours. Generally didn’t wait more than 20-30 minutes. One side of waiting room is for scheduled doctor appts, other side is for monitoring. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Still working through this, but IUI under our insurance is 50% covered. No IVF or medication coverage, which right now having everything submitted through insurance which we are now receiving the bills for, comes out for about 23k. This does not included staying in an apartment since we live in Georgia.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Rosenwaks highly prefers single embryo transfer for day 5 blastocysts for women under the age of 35.  </div>]"

Also - 8 months after my failed IVF - i reveived a $3,000 check in the mail from Weill Cornell with no explanation. I assume i overpayed my services/benefits during my IVF (i must have spent $7k out of pocket) and this was reimbursement (so many months later).

Would recommend him to my best friend, in fact I did and she got pregnant right away! I have also recommended him to a handful of other friends, and several are already pregnant! 

Having a doctor that you trust, feel at ease with and also know if you shoot him an email will get back to you VERY soon is a blessing and all you can hope for with your fertility journey.   
Also, Dr. P is sensitive to what is going on in your life whether it be travel for work, fear of needles or both!! He finds ways to make everything as easy as possible on you. 

Truly couldn’t recommend someone more -- was VERY upset when I had my last appointment with him and tried to find out if there was any way I could keep him through delivery! </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Trust him and feel comfortable asking him anything!  He is truly the most wonderful person, if you are having any issues emotional, physical tell him and he will take that into consideration.  I am VERY afraid of needles so the blood draws were not fun for me -- after telling him he would ensure that if that blood test wasn't 100% necessary I didn't have to take it. 
Also, ask him anything because once you do you will feel better - he has a way about him of just putting you at ease, no matter what the response is! </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Nigel Pereira treats all patients as if they are his family. This is a tough and emotional roller coaster but he is there every step of the way to ensure you have everything you need.  His bedside manner is also just what you need! 

 Just one of the many examples of how amazing, Dr. P is - He was away visiting a family member who was sick and still personally called me on a weekend to provide me with an update on my blood results.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I found out a few months into my fertility journey that I had PCOS and needed to see a R.E. Luckily after HSG and sperm testing everything looked good on our end and we started letrozole. We tried naturally the first month. The next 4 months we tried with an IUI (we think one month we were a little too late based on my work travel :/).  We also use an estrogen patch to help with the growth of my lining.  We were hesitant to just do clomid to start because of my lining issues but we wanted to try a mix of letrozole and clomid to see if that would bear fruit.  The first attempt of trying to medicine we saw no progress but we tried it again (this was our last ditch attempt to get pregnant before IVF) and I am thrilled and it worked! I am just shy of 13 weeks pregnant. 

I cannot say it enough, there is NO other doctor I would have rather gone on this journey with.  Dr. P and his entire team were amazing, he is the best doctor and person out there!! </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The nursing staff is amazing! They always see me and give me a big smile and ask me questions about how I am doing. I mentioned this before, but I am very afraid of needles, and they all are so patient and sweet to me. I have even broken down in tears before when I knew my blood test was going to be negative but they know what to say and do. 
Compassionate nurses make a VERY big difference!</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The clinic is very organized, despite having a lot of women go through I feel like I am a priority and trust everything. They have two locations one UES and one Tribeca. I actually love UES but schlep downtown to see Dr. P several times a week - he always tries to find days he is working UES so I don’t need to travel as far. We also get to go UES on the weekend trips so that is a nice treat or for IUI or spem analysis. 

The afternoon following a blood test you get a call from the office with updates on medication as well as next steps if you didn’t already discuss.  

Making an appointment is VERY easy too. DR. P has his own medical assistant, Megi. Megi is very responsive and makes it all work!!!</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I left my prior job and am currently paying for COBRA because the fertility benefits were better than my new job (non-existent!)

I was already well over 40 and didn't want to waste time on IUI or other less invasive methods. We did injectables hormones with daily monitoring, so dosages could be adjusted. I am a high egg producer so we triggered with a lupron and not HCG to prevent over stimulation. We used a natural cycle for our FET - which is preferable for many reasons now that we know how important the chemical secretions are during natural ovulation for pregnancy. Everything was up to date with the current research and with health and success in mind. We did PGS testing by choice since we'd previously had a baby with chromosomal abnormalities and wanted to avoid that outcome. We produced 5 genetically normal embryos from our first cycle, we froze them and transferred one.

Uptown was a bit of haul for us, and you need to go there occasionally on weekends or holidays. I could have lived without those uptown visits, but really that was only a few times, not the end of the world all things considered. It was also a little shocking to not know who was going to do your egg retrieval, but all the doctors in the practice are world class and we ended up liking our retrieval doctor as much as our main doctor.

We also felt he was very transparent and honest about our options. He was thorough while at the same time practical. He caught a polyp that my previous doctor had not. A lot of that is due to the fact that he does his own ultrasound (as do a lot of the doctors at Cornell), which allows for the best possible care.

He recommended genetic testing of the embryos, and we are glad we did because none of our four embryos were normal. We then quickly moved to a second cycle, in which Dr Reichman changed our medication. He used Lupron, which is used for people like me with poor egg quality. This cycle looked a lot better. We ended up with three genetically normal embryos. We tried a natural transfer cycle but again my hormones did not cooperate.

He recommended an HSG due to recurrent chemical pregnancies - something that was not taken seriously at the previous clinic.

Most important, he was kind, compassionate and accessible, which is incredibly important for patients struggling physically, mentally and emotionally with infertility. Dr Pereira went above and beyond in his care for us, typically responding to emails within a few hours, setting up additional appointments if we had questions, and sometimes even calling us after hours or on the weekends to review results or make us feel at ease.

He was also in constant contact with my husband and me after I experienced a rare reaction to progesterone injections. All this in the setting of living 3-4 hours away from the clinic.

Others were multinucleated and did not even approach the blastocyst stage. Trigger shot was done a little early based previous failed cycles with a different clinic, which produced no blastocysts between 2 cycles. 

Second cycle - clomid for five days total, after three days started follistim and menopur. Added cetrotide in after a few days. Hcg was 10000 units again. Had egg retrieval today, sounds like 10 eggs but won’t know until tomorrow how many, maturity, fertilization results. Not sure why the clomid first, other than I was using all donated medications and this is very inexpensive.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The second nurse, Katia, as well as her other colleagues were extremely compassionate and kind.

Compassion and going above and beyond by all members of the care team, especially Shannon C. and Waleska P. 

Weaknesses - there were a few times when we felt like they dropped the ball during our first cycle. For instance, when I met with the nurse to review the IVF instructions, she mentioned consent forms and a packet/folder... we never got those though were supposed to have gotten them when checking in for the first daily monitoring appointment. Communication after cycle failure with our doctor was not great, he would say he’d need to ask the embryologists to review everything and he would really need to think about it, but did not call back with any updates. Two weeks later I finally emailed asking for an update, which was met with apologies for the late responses.   

Things a new patient would want to know - it may be busy/crowded (which was how I felt when I walked into the clinic for monitoring the first time), but they are generally a well-run clinic. Dr. Rosenwaks might not be cheery or delicate, but he is kind, compassionate, and great at what he does. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Some days were very busy and four of us would be called at a time and placed into rooms one by one.

There is a window from 6:30-8:30 am to get the monitoring done, so you show up and check in with the front desk sometime between those hours. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Since our insurance did not cover ANYTHING related to ART, we estimated the whole thing (IVF cycle, retrieval and hospital fees, parking, medications etc.) put us close to $25,000. We also live 3-4 hours away so would sometimes stay overnight, which also added to that cost. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Generally I think he prefers single embryo transfers, at least in younger patients.

We are now under the care of CCRM, the doctor there was very surprised by Dr. Chung's approach to stick with the same protocol after seeing the same results in 3 rounds.  I think Dr. Chung's approach may work with 75% of the patients but if you have a tough/ unique case and requires the doctor to think out of box, you should not go to Dr. Chung.

I'd researched a bit on the internet and chatted with friends, but there was a lot of conflicting information out there and it really seemed like fertility treatment depended so much upon the individual and their circumstance. My gynecologist at the time was extremely unhelpful answering fertility questions — she basically told me to come back in a year if I still wasn't pregnant, and that was that. I was so discouraged and really wasn't sure what to expect with WCM. 

My first appointment with Dr. Reichman was more of a level-set; we talked about my health history, how long we'd be trying and what our options were. From the very beginning, Dr. Reichman made it clear that his objective was to get us pregnant, and he was going to do everything in his power to make that happen. I could tell he was incredibly smart and an expert in his field, which made both my husband and I feel reassured and confident in his plan. 

As Dr. Reichman's patient, I felt cared for and listened to every step of the way. I don't think I've ever had a doctor I've trusted more. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Trust his judgement. Though it can of course be helpful to do your own research or talk to other women about IVF, I honestly never took anyone else's advice over his. If you have a question, no matter how silly, ask it and he will answer. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">From my first appointment to my very last, Dr. Reichman made me feel like my case was a top priority. He always remembered my husband's name, what I did for work, and snippets from our previous conversations. He never compared me to other patients like some doctors do (which can make you feel like just another patient in a long line of patients), unless of course it was relevant or he was sharing an example. Dr. Reichman always responded to my questions honestly and openly. I knew he was working hard and following all of the right steps to get us where we wanted to be. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Over the course of seven months, we did five IUIs with no luck, moving on to IVF in June of 2018. It was a bit of a rollercoaster those seven months — taking meds for two weeks then doing the procedure, then waiting the ten days....and every time is wasn't the answer we wanted. But Dr. Reichman stayed positive. I remember every time I got my period after a failed IUI I would go to see him and his first response would something warm and encouraging. 

After our 5th failed IUI we decided to do IVF and I was actually really relieved and excited for it. Dr. Reichman carefully explained what IVF would entail and WCM offered a helpful course, so we began the process with all of our questions answered, ready to go. All in, the 10 days  or so of medication and daily monitoring wasn't so bad. Mostly it was enormously disruptive to my schedule but I didn't experience any pain or mishaps. 

We got 25 eggs which was a huge success, and ended up with 6 embryo. And as luck would have it, Dr. Reichman was able to do my transfer which made me really happy. That first transfer was successful, and I don't think I've ever been more excited than when I got the call confirming my bloodwork. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I spent a lot of time at WCM. I stopped counting after my 60th appointment. Yet somehow sometimes I would oddly look forward to those early morning appointments, which often required me to get probed and poked for blood work, etc. It was definitely because the staff was SO lovely and friendly, especially the nurse Christine who was clear and concise and had super positive energy, which I loved. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I have only good things to say about WCM. It was clean, the staff organized and friendly. Sometimes the waiting room was crazy crowded and you'd have to wait for a while, but to be expected in New York. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I found that getting there early was always best (and the nurses tipped me off to this), so waiting wasn't too much of an issue. The clinic was well-run, super organized and had an overall welcoming environment. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">In total we paid approximately $20,000 just for IVF. IUIS I believe were about $1,000 each.</div>]"

fertility treatment from the Chief of a well known health system on LI. He advised me that he wasn't sure it was a fibroid, but rather it was a ""mass"". An MRI of the Pelvis showed absolutely nothing but the pain was even occurring during my period. I had a round of IVF in which I had 13 mature egg and all of them fertilized. A grade A embryo was implanted and it didn't take. We were devastated to say the least. I sought Dr. Elias for a 2nd opinion as I knew something was not right. After reviewing all of my documentation he was able to provide a potential diagnosis....not a fibroid at all but rather a blocked Fallopian tube.

He’s super intelligent, passionate about his work, focused on results, data oriented, and a caring, communicative doctor. From our first consultation, he provided us with assurance that we had previously been lacking. The road wasn’t always smooth (2 failed IUIs), but we knew that the likelihood of getting pregnant that way was much lower than with IVF, given the data he presented in the first consult. When we had a hiccup with meds/insurance while starting IVF, he personally found a way to get us what we needed, allowing us to begin the cycle in what was a good month. I can’t ever say I’ve had a doctor that has gone so above and beyond. He was always very receptive to our thoughts and questions, to some concerns we had along the way, dedicated to making sure our experience was as good as it could be. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">If you’re results oriented and respond to data and a logic-based approach, he’s your guy. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Though Dr. Reichman is a busy doctor, I always felt like our questions were answered, issues clarified, etc. I was fairly active on email and he was super responsive. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">2 IUIs, first cycle with Clomid and second with Letrozole. Second cycle elicited a larger egg count, but ultimately, both cycles did not produce a pregnancy. For IVF, we did a frozen transfer to allow for timing flexibility on the transfer (to evaluate the lining of my uterus) and the option to genetic test the embryos. Got 12 oocytes, which led to 10 mature eggs. 8 fertilized, and 6 were viable after genetic testing. Meds prescribed pre-retrieval were Gonal F, Menopur, and Cetrotide. Did the trigger shot the night before the retrieval. Followed the transfer with progesterone inserts. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Worked with Hannah during the IUIs, she was fantastic.

At my consultation, one of the recommendations was laparoscopy and when I went in to try that as an option, she said if I was open to IVF then that would be the better option.

I never got any missed call or message (because I was hoping the clinic would call me back in time and had my phone on my person all morning) but once 9AM hit, I told my husband to just go to work because we couldn’t wait all day, plus the follicles were very small and the doctor (Dr. Reichmann) when he did my ultrasound, had no impression that I would be ready for an IUI. I was annoyed that the woman was more interested in proving she was right than realizing that I missed my third IUI. I did not express that to her, but just said that my husband had to go to work and we would not be coming in that day. I have not gone back for treatments at Weill Cornell, or any clinic for that matter, because this very last experience left me discouraged and very stressed.

Also extremely bright and has a nice bedside manner. However, he overlooked something that could have saved my husband and I months of trying to conceive. Since I was diagnosed with PCOS on my first visit to him, he assumed that the problem was me and therefore did not recommend that my husband get tested as well. After 6 months of Letrozole (which worked very well for me and got me to ovulate on the first try) and not getting pregnant, we finally pushed for a semen analysis (although he didnt recommend it yet) and found out that my husband had a low sperm count, at which point Dr. Reichman recommended IUI. After 3 IUI's and still not pregnant, WE asked Dr. Reichman if he thought it would be a good idea to see a reproductive urologist and he said it couldn't hurt and gave us a recommendation. We ended up seeing the urologist who told my husband that he had a double varicocele on both testicles and he had surgery to remove them. Now it has been 3 months post surgery and still not pregnant but at our last IUI a week ago, his sperm count had trippled. Howeevr, no we are finding out that there may be another problem with his capscore (ability of sperm to fertilize the egg) and the only way to deal with that is through IVF, however we want to wait at least until 6-7 months post-op to start IVF. In my opinion, Dr. Reichman is a great doctor, but he should have told us from the start to get my husband tested, because you never know if its just one persons fault or both until you get tested. If I had a freind going to see Dr. Reichman, I would recommend that she push to have her husband get tested on the first visit to avoid any further complexities and to make the process go faster. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">get your husband tested on the first visit even if he doesnt recommend it</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Reichman is always extremely responsive to emails (answers usually right away) and questions I had while at the office for ultrasound appointments and bloodwork. However usually when I am there for ultrasounds the visit lasts less than 5 minutes and he doesn't ask if I have any questions and doesn't always explain what he's seeing in the ultrasound. However, when we first started seeing him, we had an hour meeting with him to discuss the plan and we just had another hour meeting with him to discuss potential IVF, in which he took the time to explain everything to us and answer any questions.

Dr. Reichman says normal couples TTC have a 1/5 chance of getting pregnant every time so he thought we should do that for 5-6 months. 7th month we did IUI after finding out that my husband had low sperm count, although he probably wouldve waited to do another cycle or 2 without IUI if we hadnt done semen analysis of my husband. Then we did IUI for 6 cycles. last 2 IUI's I was on clomid instead of letrozole so I would ovulate more than one egg and have a better chance of conceiving </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">They were great, really responsive and nice and friendly. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">busy office and you have to come in early, sometimes a wait but never more than 30 minutes.

My experience was always one of an efficient morning with caring people getting things done (reminded me of a family environment getting ready to go school / work in the morning).</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I have had 7 rounds of Clomid and 4 IUI’s. My body responded well the first month to Clomid (I believe it was 50mg), but the second month only 1 or 2 follicles so the third cycle the prescription was increased to two tablets. This worked well for the last 5 cycles. Everything she prescribed made a lot of sense. Our insurance does not cover IVF - and, if it did we probably would have tried IVF after 2 IUI’s. She told us that the percentage of IUI working goes down each time, but she worked with us with what made sense financially. Because our insurance deductible was paid, we continued with IUI’s and Clomid through the rest of the calendar year. Now we are gearing up for IVF in this new year.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Holly the nurse who helps with prescriptions and such is super helpful - responds well to emails and is very informative. The other staff - Connie (manager?), Lindsay (nurse who assists Dr. Melnick and takes bloods), and Jersey (front desk) are all very nice and work really well as a team.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The facilities are great. The waiting area has nice light and comfortable seating. The clinic is quite big and feels very different from seeing Dr. Melnick at her office, which is a few blocks away and quite small (but, also new and very nice!).
Even though there are comfortable couches, due to it’s size - it feels like a hospital. I have had to wait quite a while a few days. My first trigger shot, I somehow ended up waiting for like 2 hours (there was a class - it is a teaching facility). After that, my husband always gave me the trigger shot. All of the staff are very nice.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I now am out-of-pocket that I’m starting the process for IVF and I just paid $600 for my sounding. The IUI procedures along with all the bloodwork and ultrasounds were paid by insurance and I saw some very bizarre negotiations between the clinic and the insurance so I don’t have straight numbers for them. All of my medications needed pre-authorization and I would pay out of pocket mainly due to timing for Clomid, which is quite inexpensive. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I haven’t really gotten to a conversation with her about this yet. She said that it’s most efficient for the clinic to fertilize all of the eggs that are extracted and freeze extras - but we didn’t talk about how many would be transferred.</div>]"

She did my first IUI, and then the 2nd cycle I asked to do a double IUI, both of which were performed by nurse practitioners.

One thing I will say is I feel like the timing of the IUIs may not have been ideal.  First cycle was only 22 hours post trigger (which seemed early), and 2nd cycle had IUIs at 26 &amp; 51 hours (2nd seemed really late).  I would prefer they teach you how to administer the trigger shot at home on your own so you can get the timing closer to 36 hours (my IUIs were all in the morning about 9:30-11).  We're still awaiting results of 2nd cycle, but if it didn't work I'm going to push for that.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The clinic is busy and they talk fast.  Be prepared with questions for each visit with her, or you can call &amp; talk to her assistant (Diana) or the nursing staff.  Especially when it's your first cycle I feel like you need to do this or you may wish later on you'd done things differently (it's expensive you want to maximize your odds of success each round).</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Based upon the process thus far, we are happy we chose Dr. Kang.  She has a nice demeanor, and is very easy to talk to but also professional &amp; clinical.  I've been fortunate to see her for all my monitoring ultrasounds at CRM except one (which was with an RE fellow).  Given the volume of patients they have at the clinic, she is good with remembering our specifics and has been helpful in keeping our spirits up during what can be an emotional, difficult process.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">First cycle, I went in for baseline bloodwork &amp; ultrasound on Day 2, then took 100 mg Clomid/day for Days 2-6, monitoring bloodwork &amp; ultrasound Days 12, 13 &amp; 15, and trigger shot on Day 15 with IUI next morning (22 hours after trigger; 2.25 hours post collection).  Had 3 mature follicles (16, 20, &amp; 21) on day of trigger.  Did not work and Dr. Kang said afterward that clomid had resulted in thinning of the uterine lining (endometrial stripe was 6.8 when triggered), so we would try letrozole/femara next round.

Second cycle did baseline bloodwork &amp; ultrasound on Day 4, with 5 mg letrozole/day for Days 4-8, monitoring bloodwork &amp; ultrasound Days 11 &amp; 15, and trigger shot on Day 15 with double IUI next 2 mornings (26 hours after trigger, 1.5 hours post collection, &amp; 51 hours after trigger, 2 hours post collection).  Had only 2 mature follicles (21 &amp; 14) on letrozole but better uterine lining (9.4), but given my age if this cycle doesn't work she recommended going back to clomid to increase our odds with more follicles.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Thus far in my treatment at CRM, I have not felt like I had one particular assigned nurse or clinical coordinator.  Would be really helpful for them to establish a single point of contact up front for clinical questions/issues, and in particular if you could communicate with them more directly via email, secure message etc.  Sometimes you are not in a workspace conducive to being on the phone talking about your treatment, and at those times having an alternate method by which to communicate with their staff would be invaluable.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Weill Cornell has a large volume of patients, and it's not cheap.  But hopefully you get top notch treatment and that will make it all worthwhile.  For daily monitoring, come as early as you can (ideally before 7 AM) to get in &amp; out more quickly.  Also, it seems in 2019 they have enhanced their financial collection efforts - I had not even invoiced yet for coinsurance from my 1st cycle and they were asking me to pay the balance prior to starting my 2nd cycle.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Our insurance has a $30K lifetime max for infertility treatment so I've been tracking costs of everything really carefully.  Would recommend putting it in a spreadsheet right away because there will be A LOT of insurance claims and it can get very confusing.  Here's how it breaks down thus far (total for both husband &amp; myself):
o Diagnosis (physician consult, bloodwork/ultrasound, semen analysis &amp; HSG test) = Billed charges ~$5,700; after discounts our insurance paid ~ $3,200; our cost sharing (deductible &amp; coinsurance) ~ $900.
o Genetic Testing (through Mt. Sinai Genomics/Sema4) = Billed charges ~$20,500; after discounts our insurance paid ~ $1,400; our cost sharing ~ $500
** I think the billing staff at CRM said if the genetic testing was not covered by insurance it would only cost a few hundred dollars each, so was completely shocked by the enormous amount billed to our insurance.  Wish they would have told us about that in advance (and fortunately our insurance confirmed genetic testing would not go toward our $30K lifetime maximum).**
o IUI cycle #1 (medical) = Billed charges ~$4,600; after discounts our insurance paid ~ $3,300; our cost sharing ~ $300; 
o IUI cycle #1 (Rx-clomid &amp; ovidrel) =  after discounts our insurance paid ~ $70; our cost sharing ~ $130
o IUI cycle #2 (medical-estimate) = Billed charges ~$4,700; after discounts our insurance paid ~ $3,500; our cost sharing ~ $400; 
o IUI cycle #2 (Rx-letrozole &amp; ovidrel) =  after discounts our insurance paid ~ $50; our cost sharing ~ $120</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">N/A - have not discussed since we are only doing IUI so far.</div>]"

While the monitoring appointments typically went quickly, we never felt rushed -- Dr. Reichman patiently answered all our questions both during appointments and over email. Finally, Dr. Reichman performed our last transfer himself -- the attention and care he took to make sure every last detail was in place was next level. In our experience with Dr. Reichman -- through the ups and downs of our IVF process -- it became very clear to us that he is one of the best, most humane, and deeply caring medical professionals we have ever worked with.

Being in a larger practice also had pros such as an in-house genetics counselor.  The nursing staff and admin staff were very responsive, and I always got calls back quickly when I had questions or concerns.  The only slight negative in my whole experience was that monitoring hours sometimes got backed up so there could be a bit of a wait in the mornings, but this may partially be because I tended to show up towards the end of the monitoring window.

While this can be convenient for monitoring (I've gone to three locations to accommodate my schedule) it does mean information can fall through the cracks between offices. The biggest pain point in using this clinic is they are totally clueless on making the consent process go smoothly. On each of our three retrievals they have always requested some new consent at the 11th hour that causes tremendous stress for my husband and me. It makes no sense that I can be at one of their offices every single day and without fail they have some urgent need for a form less than 24 hours before retrieval. To try to make the third time the charm, my husband accompanied me to their UES location so we could meet personally with the consent person and ensure every form was signed and appropriately witnessed. We even told her if there were forms we might need that she wasn't sure about we'd be happy to submit those for safekeeping. Even still, we were made aware of more forms that needed to be signed and witnessed four days later and another form a day after that.

She has a philosophy of giving anything reasonable a try for a few months before moving on to a new plan, which worked well with my desire to avoid invasive interventions if possible but helped me not waste too much time. Whenever there were bumps in the road (adverse reactions to a new drug or injection, etc) she changed course appropriately, and was available by phone to check in or squeeze me in for a visit first thing in the morning.

She never rushed me when I wasn't ready to do different treatments. Even when I could tell she was very busy my visits were never too rushed, and she called me back after work or set up separate appointments for times when I had additional questions. She was optimistic and positive during treatment cycles. She took into account my readiness for different interventions and the specifics of our exact situation when coming up with and changing treatment plans.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">5 unsuccessful IUIs: 3 with clomid, one with letrozole that gave me an adverse reaction, and one with a higher dose of clomid that then caused me to have ovarian cysts so we stopped using that drug. Before any IUIs, she removed a uterine polyp she found. Then after those didn't work, my husband had a varicocele repair (minor male factor). She was then ok with us trying on our own for 3 months. After that the plan was to do 3 more IUIs, but we never did the third one because at that point I'd had negative reactions to both clomid and letrozole. 
IVF: low dose of follistim, menopur, and ganirelix. Lupron and hCG trigger. 33 eggs retrieved, many (I think 23) embryos produced using ICSI, one transferred, and 7 of good enough quality to freeze at day 5 or 6.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I mostly spoke to Evangeline, and then later I think they switched from people having one nurse to patients not being matched with a single nurse.

All doctors I saw were excellent. I didn't feel like my IVF cycle would get messed up because of human error given how often they do them.
Weaknesses: Sometimes I felt they were expecting me to end up doing IVF (which I ultimately did, but at the time I didn't appreciate that feeling). The upper east side location is extremely crowded at many of the monitoring hours. You often won't see your doctor and you'll see many different nurses.

There was sometimes a wait but never too long. For IVF it was during monitoring hours, and the wait time was very variable.

The upper east side location, where I'd have to go on weekends, was more crowded and had more of a feeling of a huge line.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">For us, each IUI was somewhere around $500-700 out of pocket. All IVF costs, including drugs and ICSI, for us were about $18,500.

The second round, we only got 3 eggs out of what looked like 10 follicles growing.  I think I ovulated the eggs early, but of course, she wouldn't tell me that.  And she allowed me to believe it was a problem with my eggs.  Those two rounds of insurance covered IVF went up in smoke due to her lack of experience and attention to detail.  I always sensed I had a carrying issue, cause I've had chemicals and not real miscarriages.  I asked for the receptivity and ERA tests on my lining - Melnick told me those tests weren't necessary.  My second private doctor (with YEARS more experience than Melnick) has been able to retrieve 11 eggs, with at least four making it to day 5 blasts. I got these numbers two retrievals in a row.  Melnick only retrieved a total of 5 eggs over two retrievals.  My current doctor also did the biopsies on my lining and discovered I have endometriosis - something Melnick didn't think to look into - even after requesting testing.

The treatment was timed intercourse with Clomid, which we did 2 cycles and then moved to Clomid with IUI for 2 cycles and 1 with Letrozole.

Trigger used was Lupron and HCG. We got 4 embryos from this cycle, 12  eggs retrieved, fertilization rate not ideal. We did a day 5 fresh transfer with 1 embryo and froze the other 3. The fresh transfer didn’t take, so we moved to transfer 1 frozen, this also didn’t work. Based on the results from IVF round 1 and the transfers, the recommendation was to try and bank more embryos, Dr. Pfeifer moved us to an increased dose of Gonal-F 225 adding in Menopur and Cetrotide on day 4, Lupron and HCG trigger on day 9. We got 26 eggs, 14 mature but 0 fertilizer and I had OHS. We regrouped after I recovered and decided to transfer both of my remaining embryos via a programmed cycle (using estrogen patches and adding progesterone shots). I did get pregnant with one baby from this cycle, but lost the baby at 8 weeks after hearing the heart beat at 7weeks. We took a 4 month break after that and started again with a cycle ( 75 Gonal and menopur at the same time, adding Cetrotide on day 5) Trigger on day 10 with Lupron and HCG.

My previous fertility clinic was ignoring a serious complication from a D&amp;C they performed after my miscarriage, and Dr. Reichman immediately took action. During this emotionally and physically difficult time, Dr. Reichman was compassionate, caring and confident. My husband and I immediately knew he would be the doctor that would finally bring us our baby. And thus started our year long journey with Dr. Reichman to conceive (successful journey, I'm almost 24 weeks with our little man thanks to Dr. Reichman). A seemingly cut and dry ""lean PCOS"" case at my old clinic, I went from an easy case to an unresponsive and quite complicated one quickly. But Dr. Reichman was always up to the challenge, whatever curve balls my body decided to throw our way. We ultimately moved to IVF and Dr. Reichman expertly guided us through the process; careful not to overstimulate me as I was at high risk of OHSS, but aggressive enough that we have amble embryos in the freezer for our future family. Having now been at the two leading fertility clinics in NYC, I can say without any hesitation that Dr. Reichman is truly an exceptional doctor and person that raises the bar for the standard of care. He is one of the smartest, most caring doctors you will ever see. He earnestly cares about his patients, their mental health during this difficult process, and the outcome. Unlike other fertility clinics, he makes it a point to be the person that sees you every single time you come into the office, and to answer all questions that you have. Not only does he perform every ultrasound, but he will perform every procedure in your fertility journey from an HSG to a hysteroscopy. In what can sometimes be a scary and intimidating journey, it was such a relief not to be passed around to a million different doctors and to always see him for every aspect of the process. It also helped me build a sense of trust and faith in him, which was well-deserved. You'll be hard pressed to find an RE with more impressive academic credentials than him. He is forward with his well-reasoned opinions about your treatment, but also lets you have some say and control in the process where appropriate. He is always reachable by email, and no question is too small or stupid. His protocols are specifically tailored to each patient - you will never feel like you are being thrown into a boilerplate protocol that isn't designed to your needs. And that is because Dr. Reichman takes the time to really think about his patients, what they need, and the quickest but safest way possible to reach the end goal. He always told me to try not to worry and to let him do the hand-wringing, and he was right. I remember him calling me after work hours one day during stims because he was had been thinking about my blood work from that day even after the nurse had already called me with instructions and had decided to slightly adjust my dose for that night. That is the kind of doctor he is. I am so grateful that I had a doctor who I could trust implicitly to get me through this process. Do yourself a favor and just make an appointment to see Dr. Reichman - you won't regret it.

I found writing them down or noting them in my phone made it easy to make sure I didn't forget anything. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">For IUIs I was on lextrozole + trigger shot, and then letrozole+menopur+trigger.

She always provided clear instructions and promptly returned any messages I left with questions. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Cornell is one of the leading fertility clinics in the US for good reason. It is a well-oiled machine and the lab is extraordinary. The classes and genetic counseling in order to start IVF were organized and easy to sign up for. I loved going to the Tribeca office, which I felt was a warmer, friendlier environment than the main UES office, and more organized. I also felt like the wait times were much less at Tribeca, I don't think I ever went more than 10-15 minutes past my appointment time before being taken back. Also the patient coordinator, Amanda is excellent. She was always reachable and extremely helpful. Don't be afraid to call or email with any questions!</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">My insurance covered the injectible medications and most of the monitoring appointments. It did not cover PGS testing or freezing of the embryos. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Reichman prefers to do single embryo transfers if you elect to do PGS testing. At first I was hesitant because I just wanted to be pregnant, but in hindsight this approach is for the best.

Dr. Reichman called me and firmly told me not to do the second d and c and that it could affect future fertility, and offered to do a hysteroscopy instead.

I am now under the care of another doctor and have already been diagnosed with PCOS among other things, which I am being treated for, but which never came to light at Cornell.

After our final meeting with him post 2nd IVF, he still have no idea if it was an egg or sperm issue.

He talks to me in a way that I understand what is going on, but also that shows he respects my intelligence as a health care professional. 

Dr. Goldschlag also has a way of lightening the mood without coming off as uncaring or harsh. He jokes with me about my reliance on Dr. Google, and he always is up to date on all the studies and new tests I bring up and what is good about the studies or what was lacking in them and why he does or does not buy into the findings. I like that he is constantly researching and learning and not just doing the same thing over and over. No two of my protocols have ever been the same (until this current cycle bc the last cycle we did I got pregnant with my daughter and we are hoping to recreate that!!), he is always taking my latest hormone levels into account and tweaking everything so I react to the meds the best way possible. 

Also, he always gives my husband and I a few minutes after a monitoring appointment in the room to ask questions and talk about what is going on in order to make sure that we are comfortable with everything. It can be very hard to reach anyone in the office, and almost impossible to reach him on the phone, so I like that he gives us that time. 

Another thing he has started doing (I am not sure if this is for everyone, but my IVF cycles were not like this), is scheduling monitoring appointments with him specifically, so I am on his schedule and know when I am going to be seeing him so that I do not have to wait as long, and there is a continuity of care, as opposed to seeing which ever MD is on call that day for ultrasounds, and then it taking several days before I see him again and can get my questions answered. 

Dr. Goldschlag is also EXCELLENT when the cycle fails. We have had multiple cycles fail - very, very difficulty failures - and the way he handled it, my emotions, my husband's emotions, he was very straight forward and honest with us about our bleak situation and what the next steps were. I appreciated the honesty and when he was not being straightforward with me at one point I called him out on it and from then on he gave it to me like it was. I feel for myself and my husband, it is better for us to know the truth from the outset than for us to be under the assumption that we are going to have this amazing experience. 

Overall he was very willing to work with us and ultimately he was able to help us get to our goal and give us our beautiful daughter. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Give him a chance to get to know you before  you assume he is too quiet or hands off. Once I got to know him a little better and we were all able to relax around each other, it got much easier. 
</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Goldschalg and I get along very well. He has a very calming presence and helps bring me down off my crazy (sometimes hormone induced) tantrums about why it is not fair that I was not getting pregnant. He was very patient with me, always answered all my questions, talked to me about all the options and why something would be a good/bad/or ok idea for treatment. He always said that he would be willing to do anything I wanted, but he wanted me to listen to his opinion on the matter before making decisions. He knows that I am a healthcare professional and brings it up regularly, in explanation for decisions and for why he is explaining things to me in a scientific way. He talks to me in a way that I feel I understand what we are talking about, but that he respects my intelligence and research on our diagnosis. 

When we had a cycle fail with no viable embryos, Dr. Goldschlag called me several days in a row, sometimes multiple times a day to update me on the situation and make sure I was ok. We spent over an hour talking about the results and what we were going to proceed with and he did not hang up the phone until he knew I was ok, and we had scheduled an appointment to meet and go over everything, despite it being a holiday weekend. 

I know a lot of people who have cycled with Dr. Goldschlag sometimes are not pleased with their experience because they feel like a number, but I think that is more due to the size of the clinic. Cornell has hundreds of patients cycling through on a regular basis and if you do not stand up for yourself and advocate for your care, you may get lost, but if you are able to do that, you will get excellent care at a top rated clinic. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">As an Orthodox Jew, Cornell has a specific protocol they use to help push off the egg retrieval until a little farther on in the cycle (called the Mikva Protocol), to help shorten the period and keep any spotting at bay. 

Started with estrogen patches for a few days, then added a Ganirelix shot for three days, then started Menopure and GonalF, then added the Ganirelix back in, then triggered with HCG. My dosages were incredibly low bc of my VERY high AMH levels. First cycle was extended (I dont think the dosages were high enough and I was injecting them incorrectly so I wasnt getting the full dose). 

Second cycle was the same overall, but higher dosages and I had better quality eggs (more mature) than the first cycle. (Cycle failed due to Male factor component)

First IUI with clomid - did not respond well to Clomid, poor follicle and lining
Second IUI with Letrazol - started with 5mg a day for 5 days, three days off, then bumped up to 7.5 mg a day for 5 days. Went in and had 2 beautiful 24mm follicles (one on each ovary) and lining was almost 9mm. Triggered with 10kHCG and IUI the following day. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Jamie - Only had her the first cycle. She called me the first day and the last to let me know it failed but other than that I always talked with Allison. She gave me the wrong info which had to get changed and was thankfully caught before I gave myself the wrong meds. Was weird hearing from her that my cycle failed when I literally had nothing to do with her. She was no longer with Dr. Goldschlag when I came back six months later for my next cycle. 

Allison - Was there from my first cycle (she caught Jamie's mess up) all the way until my successful pregnancy. She often seemed overwhelmed, probably because of Dr. Goldschlag's caseload and how many phone calls she had to make. She always returned phone calls, and gave clear instructions. She was also a lot more down to earth than some of the other nurses I came across there, which was nice. She also was SOO happy when she got to call me with my positive pregnancy test after our fourth cycle, we were both crying on the phone together, because she had been with me through it from the beginning. 

Cheryl and Tamara - Dr. Goldschlag's nursing team this time is a little more haphazard, but they call me back and they seem to have things together. I dont have a real feel for them yet because I just returned to the clinic in the past month, but so far nothing bad to say. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The clinic is HUGE. If you are not ready for that, either find someplace new, or prepare yourself to advocate. If you are in their face and vocal you will have a better experience because they will know who you are. 

That being said this clinic also specializes in taking cases that no one else will touch. They are not as concerned with their success rates and only taking patients who will improve their rates, rather they are willing to give almost anyone a shot and they will adapt their protocols to meet patient's needs. 

One thing I like is that they have team meetings and come up with protocols as a team, not individual doctors making decisions on their own. This is comforting because you know that they are checking each others work. 

Something else that could be a little discomforting for patients is that because there are so many patients and the clinic is part of the hospital, not everything takes place in the clinic. Somethings take place in the radiology dept and then the lab, egg retrievals, and transfers happen in a surgical center in the hospital (I liked this because it was just IVF procedures happening there so no one else was walking in and out and you knew the nurses and front desk people did this all day every day). Also, the Andrology lab is on a different floor so you have to take the elevator and walk around with the sperm sample in a paper bag from when they give it to you to when you give it back to the nurse and have the IUI done (a little weird for people who know what is in the tube and see you walking around with it). </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">What I do now is schedule an actual appointment, show up then and get seen within 15 minutes of that appointment. 

At the same time and what I used to do was show up anywhere from 6:30 to 9 am and sign in and wait in the waiting room to first get called for bloodwork and then ultrasound. The MD you see for the scan can be any of the doctors in the practice. Their system is automated, so there is a computer system that tells the tech who the next patient they are taking for blood or ultrasound is and what room to put them in. This keeps things moving assuming patients are not missing in the bathroom or grabbing coffee outside at the cart on the sidewalk. Sometimes there can be close to 100 patients waiting to be seen though, which can make the wait take several hours. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">My IVF was covered by insurance but the cost at the time was approximately $12000 for IVF with ICSI (we also did Micro-TESE in conjunction which was $15k out of pocket)

I did an IVF cycle with 8 days of stims (Menopur, Follistim, and starting on day 4, ganerelix as an antagonist).

Because of this, and my risk of OHSS, Dr. Pfeifer took a more conservative approach to the stim meds. I never did more than 150 units of follistim per day, and then I also had menopur and cetrotide. And then progesterone in oil going into transfer.  They retrieved 13 eggs, 9 mature, 8 fertilized. By Day 3, they were concerned none would make it to day 5 in the lab so we transferred fresh at day 3. Neither took.  I had 2 embryos make it to freeze. The first transfer was positive but ended in miscarriage. Second transfer was positive but ended as a chemical pregnancy. We will be going for a 2nd egg retrieval in 2019 and I know she is going to up the meds a bit to try to get more eggs. We will do a day 5 fresh transfer (my decision, not the doctor's) and then PGS test the rest of the embryos that make it to freeze. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">My nurses for my retrieval and first two transfers were great. Compassionate and happy to answer questions. With my last transfer, it seemed like I had a different nurse every time I called or was called back. And none of them were the same as my first transfers.  That just meant that I felt like I was being passed off. Crystal was always good, but I think they switched her off my care at some point and I got people who didn't always seem to know what they were doing. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">This clinic runs like a well-oiled machine. They know what they are doing and do it well. The morning bloodwork feels a bit number like--but they have a massive amount of people to get through in a short time. Tribeca is definitely better about being more human and caring than the main office in the upper east side--and it's so much more peaceful and quiet. Be aware that your doctor will not necessarily be the one doing your procedures. Each clinic's doctor is assigned to a specific day since there is only one surgical room. The doctors I've had though for retrieval and transfer have been great. Also know that your ultrasounds will not necessarily be with your doctor.  And on retrieval and transfer day...you will wait.

Super annoying watching people that arrived an hour after you go in an hour before you.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Not a cattle call. It was a well-oiled machine.

Medications were about $6,000-8,000. Hotel for 3 weeks was about $6,000. FETs were about $4,000 plus medication and hotel.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Pfeifer is very smart about it.  She prefers to transfer just one, but will allow 2 if you really want. She moreso bases it on age and circumstances. I'm under 35 so I only transfer 1. At 35, 2 would be okay.

The only weakness, is it can be difficult to get someone on the phone if you have a question.  I usually have to leave a voice mail, and then they call me back a few hours later.

Dr Elias then said we should hold off on the lap and try some clomid cycles, some with IUI.  They didn’t work and finally I told him I wanted the lap and to move to ivf which he agreed to readily. Turned out my left tube was completely blocked, Black, twisted, a total mess and had to be removed.  I wish Dr Elias had been more aggressive and gone with his gut feeling after the HSG that the tube was not right and recommended a lap from the beginning (which I would have been fine with) - especially since previous to developing the tube issue developing, I’d always gotten pregnant on the first month of trying (although many ended in miscarriage). I wasted 7 months and a large chunk of my insurance money on IUIs and clomid cycles that were never going to work with that tube. At the age of 42, the wasted 7 months was the hardest to swallow.

From the moment we sat down in our consultation, it became clear that he was not only an excellently trained physician, but was also passionate about his specialty, and sincerely empathetic towards his patients.  This combination allowed me to truly relax and leave myself in his hands (e.g., no more endless googling!), in a way I never really did with my first doctor, and I think that made a difference in our outcome, if only by improving my mental wellbeing as we went through our cycle.  We saw him at every single monitoring appointment, and when questions arose, I emailed him directly, and heard back without fail in a few hours or less.  From what I understand from friends, these are unique qualities to find in a doctor at the top clinics in NYC, given the huge numbers of patients they churn out.  In short, even before our first (and only) cycle was finished, my husband and I were thrilled with the level of care we received from Dr. Reichman.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">If you find yourself overwhelmed by science or statistics, don't be afraid to ask questions.

He needed no prompting about any of my personal details, or what our plan was.  And when I had emotional moments, the level of compassion he showed me was well beyond what I expect from even the best-trained medical professionals..</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">We saw Dr. Reichman after completing four cycles with another doctor.  On the surface, Dr. Reichman kept the same protocol, as I had a good response to the drugs: 5 days of .5mg of letrozole, an HCG trigger shot, and an IUI.  My monitoring appointments at CRM, however, were much more frequent.  I believe we had four or five ultrasounds before Dr. Reichman decided I was ready for the trigger shot, which ultimately took place a few days later in my cycle than previous treatment.  This meant my uterine lining was thicker than it had ever been, and we had one great sized follicle plus another potentially mature one.  He also timed the IUI differently than my previous one - this IUI took place about 28 hours after the trigger shot.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I didn't have a great deal of interaction with the nursing staff, as I did not undergo IVF.  I called a few times with questions, and they were very helpful in their responses.  I wasn't assigned a specific nurse, but when you start treatment at CRM, you receive contact information for your specific doctor's team, including nurses whose duties are divided and specified.  The nurse I typically reached out to (based on these descriptions) was frequently out of the office (it was during the summer, so this may not be the case year-round).  When I left messages on Dr. Reichman's general nursing line, however, they were always quick to call back.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The Tribeca office of Weill Cornell CRM is a hidden gem.  The facilities are new, the waiting room is never packed, and the front desk staff are wonderful.  My husband and I visited the main office on the UES once, for our IUI, and it was a night-and-day contrast to Tribeca - incredibly crowded, seemingly somewhat dated, and huge.  Given the large number of doctors and patients, I would be surprised if they are able to support the same continuity of the Tribeca office (as in, always seeing your doctor for each monitoring appointment, which was amazing!).  I suppose if there is one downside to the Tribeca office, it is that on weekends, holidays, and for procedures like an IUI or embryo transfer, you will need to visit the UES location.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">My husband and I had recently moved and were waiting for our new insurance to kick in during our cycle with Dr. Reichman, so we paid entirely out of pocket.  Our costs were about $5500.

Clomid and Letrozole, 2 egg retrievals and 1 embryo transfer.  I am currently 12 weeks pregnant with my first child all thanks to Dr. Reichman! 
After trying Clomid and Letrozole for a few months, I was eager to begin IVF.   I would like to point out that Dr Reichman did regard me as one of his more challenging IVF patients.  I'm very petite with PCOS and a very high AMH so I had to be carefully monitored while stimming to avoid OHSS.  I saw Dr. Reichman every day for nearly 2 weeks and he was very good about explaining what the different levels from blood tests meant and his strategy for setting the dosage of meds each night, even during the holidays.  As all readers will be aware, this process is very involved and quite intense, and I definitely felt that Dr. Reichman was with me all of the way.  I was 35 at the time of my first retrieval and I have to say I thought we would be done after a single egg retrieval since my AMH was so high.  We were disappointed when the numbers quickly dwindled from eggs retrieved, to mature eggs, then fertilized, to the ones that made it to day 5. We were only able to get 1 PGS normal embryo from the 18 retrieved eggs. I knew Dr. Reichman was disappointed as well.  He outlined what we might try differently if we chose to do another retrieval and was always optimistic he could give us the family we wanted.  Not that I had any reason to doubt Dr Reichman, but more because of the time and money involved, I sought a second opinion. I met with another renowned clinic and the doctor there actually said my protocol was excellent and that she would not have done anything differently to Dr. Reichman. That doctor also said Weill Cornell is an excellent fertility center.  That was very reassuring and we decided to do another retrieval with Dr. Reichman.  I began Metformin (even though I don't have diabetes, some say it helps with egg quality in PCOS women), weekly acupuncture, and drastically changed my diet.  I waited 4 months in between egg retrievals since it takes 90 days to recruit a primordial follicle.  The second retrieval resulted in 2 euploid and 2 mosaic embryos.  With 5 total frozen embryos, we decided to try a frozen embryo transfer. 
I am currently 12 weeks pregnant and looking forward to seeing Dr. Reichman for the next FET. The ART process is very complicated and there were so many things I had questions about.  Dr. Reichman patiently helped me weigh the pros and cons of each decision and he went out of his way to treat me and put my mind at ease.  We are very grateful to him.
</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The morning monitoring sessions go quickly.  Do your research and have all your questions ready to go.  Weill Cornell is one of the best and therefore one of the busiest clinics. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Reichman always responded promptly to emails.  There were many ups and downs during this process and he took time to have multiple sit downs to regroup and strategize throughout the process.  I felt like he genuinely cared about our case.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Few months of Clomid with trigger shot, then Letrozole with trigger shot (no IUI).
Very low dose follistim, menopur, ganirelix for egg retrievals with all Lupron trigger to avoid OHSS. 
Letrozole to prep for FET followed by 10 weeks of progesterone suppositories.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Hannah was my primary nurse, but you will often have a different nurse call you each day.  At first I was weary about speaking with a different nurse each day, but they are very well organized and able to answer all your questions. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Being one of the best clinics, it's also one of the busiest.  It's not the place to go if you need hand holding.  Patients do not have any contact with the Embryology Lab which I found frustrating at times, but rest assured they are top notch. Dr. Palermo, the developer of ICSI is the Director of Andrology Lab here.  Your doctor can also contact the lab for any specific questions you may have.

Morning monitoring hours are extremely busy. I went between 6:30am-7:30am every morning to avoid waiting and I preferred the Tribeca location.  You need to be extremely proactive with your insurance and coverage, especially if you need anything from the Pre-Certification team, who were not very responsive and often times dropped the ball.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Always go between 6:30-7:30am to avoid waiting and crowds.  Front desk demeanor at the Tribeca location was always very pleasant.  Tribeca office a much nicer experience than UES office. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Base price approximately $17,500 for an IVF cycle before cost of ICSI, embryo storage, anesthesiology fee, hospital fee and meds.  There are also a series of tests needed prior to starting IVF that can add up.  Total price varies for each patient and I would say ours was between $22,000-$30,000 for each round of IVF with an insurance ART life time max coverage of $10,000, which was of course maxed out within the first IVF round.</div>]"

My obgyn recommended that I see Dr. Reichman or Dr. Pfeiffer for IVF. Dr. Reichman had better reviews but his assistant never called me back, so I ended up seeing Dr. Pfeifer. At 40 years old, my AMH was 2.29 and my FSH was 7.18, so we thought it would be ok to start with 3 IUI. My first two IUIs were unsuccessful. Dr. Pfeifer then found a small fibroid which she removed surgically. I thought this might be preventing me from getting pregnant so we tried 2 more IUIs which were unsuccessful before moving on to IVF. I’ve done 3 ivf cycles using the antagonist protocol, with adjustments and significant improvement with each cycle. For IVF#1, I had 5 follicles and 7 eggs retrieved, 7 mature, 5 fertilized, but there was fragmentation with most of the embryos. For IVF#2 (four months after IVF#1), I had 9 follicles and 7 eggs retrieved, 5 mature, 4 fertilized but the quality was much better – no fragmentation. For IVF#3 (seven months after IVF#1), I had 9 follicles and 16 eggs were retrieved, 13 mature, 12 fertilized and 6 made it to blastocyst. Two were transferred on day 5. Four were PGS tested: 2 normal and 1 mosaic. So far I have had a favorable experience with Dr. Pfeifer. At some point, I asked Dr. Pfeifer if DHEA supplementation could help and she was neutral on it, she said the research isn’t conclusive but it if I wanted to it wouldn’t hurt. I ended up doing my own research and taking DHEA as well as other supplements and my cycles have improved the longer I have been taking the supplements, although I'm not sure if it is the DHEA or something else. I am personally doing a lot to try to improve egg quality, as far as diet, exercise, supplements, acupuncture, yoga, meditation and herbs and educating myself about avoiding fertility harming toxins, and having emotional support of close friends (who have gone through IVF) and family. My second and third cycles were also a lot easier for me mentally since I had been through it before and knew what to expect and was much more adept at administering the medication.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Pfeifer is a great doctor and you are in good hands. My advice is more in general about IVF: Be sure to have a lot of support from friends and family. Take time to nurture yourself, and educate yourself about IVF so you know what questions to ask. Take the time to educate yourself on what diet, exercise, lifestyle and supplement changes you can implement to improve egg quality because there is a lot you can do. ""The Infertility Cure"" and ""It Starts With The Egg"" are good resources. The CCRM fertility supplement list is also helpful.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Pfeifer is a kind and compassionate doctor.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">IVF#1: For my first round of IVF, my protocol was 325 to 400 iu Gonal-F for the first 5 days, then 250iu Gonal F, 150iu Menopur and 1 vial Cetrotide for the next 5 days, and HCG trigger on day 11. I only developed 5 follicles, mostly on my left side, which was not as good a response as we thought I’d have. However, Dr. Chung did my retrieval and we were able to get 7 eggs. All 7 eggs were mature, 5 fertilized and we transferred 4 embryos on day 3 by Dr. Schattman. Dr. Pfeifer said that most of the embryos had fragmentation, so it would be best to transfer them on day 3 since it didn’t look like they’d survive to day five. The four that were transferred were one 10 cell, and three 8 cell. One of them was grade 1.5 (which is the highest) and the other 3 were grade 3 which are “so-so” quality. The cycle failed and I spoke to Dr. Pfeifer about what we could do to improve the next cycle. She said it was remarkable that all of my eggs were mature, even though I had some follicles under size 10 and 11 and that she’d trigger me earlier next time, with a lead follicle between the size of 16 to 17, since my eggs appear to mature at a smaller follicle size. She said she also would have me start Menopur sooner. She explained that they aim to have 90% of the eggs be mature. She said this could help with the egg quality because if you are triggered too late the quality could decline. Later on in my research, I learned that there are studies proving that older women usually do much better when they are triggered at a smaller follicle size. IVF#2: I started taking micronized DHEA (25mg 3x a day) along with other supplements 2 to 3 months before my 2nd IVF. I also saw a fertility acupuncturist 1 to 2x a week who prescribed me custom herbs to take before and after ovulation, did yoga regularly, and I tried to cut down on exposure to bpa/phthalates/fragrances, the use of household plastics and plastic food containers/water bottles. I had a better response for IVF #2. My protocol was 300iu Gonal-F and 150iu Menopur daily, with Cetrotide added mid-cycle. When I triggered, I had 9 follicles (6 on the right and 3 on the left) – which was 4 more than I had with IVF #1. On the morning of my trigger my follicles on the right were size 17.8, 16.8, 16.6, 15, 14, 11.4, and on the left they were size 15.3, 14 and 14 and my E2 was 1944. However, only 7 eggs were retrieved by Dr. Kang. 5 of the eggs were mature and 4 fertilized but they didn’t have the fragmentation that embryos had during my first cycle. All four were transferred on Day 3 and Dr. Pfeifer did my transfer. We were hopeful, since all 4 embryos were graded 1.5, which is the highest grade, but I didn’t get pregnant. I met with Dr. Pfeifer and I asked her a lot of questions, such as should I be tested for natural killer cells, should we test for dna fragmentation, are there any other tests I should do and should I try an ultrasound guided transfer. She said she didn’t believe in natural killer cells and didn’t think any other tests were needed. She said she didn’t think an ultrasound guided transfer would make a difference, but we could do it next time. Also, she said she was happy with how my second cycle went and would keep my protocol the same, except she would have me use the Estrogen patch before my next cycle. IVF#3: I had my 3rd cycle of IVF two months after my second cycle and it was the best so far. The number of eggs retrieved doubled, and the number of fertilized eggs tripled compared to my previous cycle. My protocol was the same as IVF#2 except I took the estrogen patch 6 days before I started stims, changing it every other day. My AFC on day 1 of my period was 12, with 6 follicles on the left and 6 on the right. After 10 days of stims, the morning of my trigger I had 9 follicles, 4 on the right (size 16.3, 16.2, 14.5, 12.5) and 5 on the left (size 17.6, 16.8, 15.2, 17.5, 14.6). My lining was 11-12 and E2 was 2440. I was triggered with 5,000 HCG. Dr. Kligman did my retrieval and 16 eggs were retrieved, 13 were mature and 12 fertilized. This was amazing considering I never had more than 7 eggs retrieved or 4 eggs fertilize. Dr. Pfeifer was surprised with the results since my response was significantly better with virtually the same protocol. This was the first time I had enough eggs to push to day 5. On day 5, I transferred 2 blastocysts grade 3AB and 2.5AB via a fresh ultrasound guided transfer by Dr. Chung, with a visiting doctor from Taiwan present. On day 6, I was told I had four extra blasts which were PGS tested. Two weeks later I was told that 2 were normal and one was mosaic, and I had the option of knowing the genders. Unfortunately, the fresh transfer was not successful but I am feeling hopeful after my recent follow up appointment with Dr. Pfeifer. She said she expects a 60% success rate for each frozen embryo and would recommend a single embryo transfer, and she is encouraging me to do a number of tests that should improve my chances for success. I did a lot of research on questions to ask and tests to do after a failed IVF cycle. I asked if I should do a saline sonogram (to check for fibroids), hysteroscopy, endometrial biopsy/scratch, endometrial receptivity array, and be tested for an infection or blood clotting disorders. Dr. Pfeifer said I should do an saline sonogram (between day 6 and day 10 of my cycle) and depending on the results, we would or would not do a hysteroscopy. She discussed the endometrial biopsy/scratch and endometrial receptivity array and said that it could possibly aid in implantation. However, since I had irregular cycles in the past, I would need to do a mock cycle with estrogen and progesterone prior to doing this test, so I'd have to wait another month before I could do this test since I need to start taking the estrogen on day 2 of my period. She didn't think I was not getting pregnant because of an infection since my white blood cell counts are normal, but she agreed to have my blood tested for clotting issues. She was so pleased with my improvement in more than doubling the number of eggs retrieved and the significant improvement in egg quality that she took notes as I shared with her what I did differently. I told her that I continued with acupuncture and yoga which I strongly believe contributed to stress reduction, and that my husband also made positive changes in lifestyle and also took supplements which I found supportive. I shared with her a very long list of supplements that I had been taking after the first failed cycle, including 500mg of Ubiquinol, 100mg of Pycnogenol, 75mg of DHEA and several others. I stopped taking certain supplements during stims and in the two week wait. I continued to try to avoid exposure to bpa and other toxins. I started doing more cardio and meditation, changed my diet to include more protein and good fats and less carbs and less gluten when possible. I also incorporated more warm, cooked foods, especially vegetables and bone broths. I tried to keep my carb intake under 40% but it realistically ended up in the range of 35% to 45%. I cut out caffeine except for chocolate. I had dark chocolate frequently and I cut down on alcohol except for a few glasses of wine on a few occasions socially. Dr. Pfeifer believes that diet, exercise and sleep are all very important to one's overall health and she encouraged me to keep doing what I am doing.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The nursing staff at Cornell is excellent, particularly at the Tribeca office. You are in great hands.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Others have said it and I agree. Cornell is a well oiled machine. I don't think I've had to wait more than 15 minutes to be seen for monitoring. I've found every doctor and nurse at Cornell to be genuinely kind and compassionate. Only once did I meet a doctor who seemed to be in a rush and that was Dr. Spandorfer. He wasn't unprofessional, but he seemed rushed during my ultrasound and didn't count or measure as many follicles as the other doctors. I have heard that the labs at Cornell are among the best. I have confidence in the labs, doctors and nurses at Cornell.. Cornell also does day 3 transfers and will transfer untested embryos. A friend that went to RMA said that they only transfer PGS tested embryos for women over 40. The main weakness is that everything is communicated over the phone whereas online or email would be more efficient and if you have a question for the nursing staff, you need to leave a message for them to call you back. Also, not sure other clinics do this, but the day after your trigger shot, you need to go to the York Avenue office for pre-op at 6:30am which is very early since my trigger shots were usually 11pm to 12pm.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">A well oiled machine. At the Tribeca office, I usually arrived between 7:45am and 8:10am and I never waited more than 15 minutes. Usually it was 5 minutes or less.

I learned my lesson that if you arrive after 8am at York Ave. you may need to wait a long time.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">4 rounds of IUI plus 2 rounds of IVF totaled $48,000. I paid about $13,000 out of pocket after $35,000 in fertility benefits/insurance was used ($25,000 for treatment and $10,000 for medication). Note that fertility medication for the first round of IVF cost approximately $11,500 with insurance covering the first $10,000. When you use insurance, the prices of the drugs are somehow inflated. For the second round of IVF, I purchased the same amount of fertility medication, but since I was paying out of pocket, it only cost around $4,000 instead of $11,500. I do not have the total costs for the third IVF cycle yet.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">For a 40 year old woman, she would recommend transferring up to 4 embryos for a fresh day 3 transfer (untested), up to 2 on a day 5 fresh transfer (untested), and 1 PGS-tested normal embryo for a frozen transfer.</div>]"

If you have questions, he will answer them and give you the time you deserve, but sometimes on the spot it can be overwhelming and you're not necessarily sure what your questions are.

My first interaction with her was very unpleasant and I hung up crying. I left a message for a call back, because you never get a live person, and she never called me back, which was extremely stressful with the time sensitive nature. I then had to wait another month, which was fine because she stressed me out so much, I felt completely overwhelmed and needed to take some time to process everything. Every interaction with her has been unpleasant and I have felt dismissed. I explained to her that I needed a specific pharmacy for my insurance to cover the medications and she claimed, ""We never had that conversation."" My prescription was called in to the specific pharmacy, after being called into a different one, so obviously we had a conversation about it. She was very curt on the phone, which makes a stressful time even more stressful. She was also very rude with me when I asked if my file mentioned to try and call after 3:00pm, because I'm a teacher. She made it clear that that's not always going to be possible. I said I understood that, I just wanted to know if it was in my file because I had asked the doctor's assistant to make a note of it. She is so quick to talk over you and doesn't hear what you're asking. She has taken an already stressful time in a woman's life and made it much more stressful, which is terrible. Just because she deals with this everyday and it is easy for her, she needs to understand that this is overwhelming and patients have questions. It was a very upsetting experience. 

That being said, Dr. Goldschlag's assistant, Shanise, is lovely and has gone above and beyond to make sure my questions get answered and that I feel comfortable with the process. I mentioned my interaction with the nurse and how upsetting it was to feel invisible and dismissed and she really stepped up and has helped with the process. She told me that I should always contact her directly and she will get my questions to the right place and get back to me with the necessary information.

Two months later I met with Dr Reichman and knew he was a good doctor and cared about his patients on a personal level. He listens to you as a patient, and offers his expertise in a straight forward but kind way. Our insurance does not cover infertility and he was great about keeping that mind while treating us.

We lowered my dosages accordingly throughout stimulation. Because of our age, and no found issues he kept the ivf cycle very simple. We did not want to do a lot of add ons (testing, assisted hatching, etc) as our insurance doesn't cover anything and he was great about not pushing those on us. He did strongly encourage us to only transfer one embryo, which I was fine with! Our cycle with him was very different in the fact that we did less medicine, and stimulated for a shorter amount of time then we did with our Utah Doctor.

I did appreciate she taking all precautions before going through with any treatments (in my case there was some suspicion that my uterus bicornuate uterus so she recommended I go through an MRI to confirm. Also when I reported feeling extremely emotional when she prescribed clomid she switched me over to letrozole, which worked much better. She listed to my life situation and recommended an altered plan to proceed with IVF while my life (work and school responsibilities) got sorted out. My only kind of negative comment about the treatment strategy would be her lack of enthusiasm towards supplements. After doing some additional research I asked her thoughts on adding CoQ10, she was very unenthusiastic and said it couldn't hurt, but she also said that the vitamin/supplement industry is a multi-million dollar industry, etc. when I inquired about vitamin E and melatonin. I was a little taken aback, but respect her feelings.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The front desk/reception staff (who also helped with insurance follow-up) was direct, but overall ok. I quickly learned it was a busy clinic and they did the best they could. There was a Practice Specialist, who was very personable and a good listener when the issue with the assigned nurse arose. The nurse I was assigned to, however, was very curt on the phone and insisted on phone only follow-up, even though email was preferred for my partner and me. After a mandatory IVF orientation class, when my partner asked a question, she laughed at him (there were other couples there too) and as she apologized after seeing our faces she laughed through her apology. I did not want to jeopardize our treatment and did not bring it up with the staff or doctor.  I inquired about being switched to another nurse coordinator but was told that they were short staffed and we'd have to continue working with this particular nurse. From here the issues with follow-up got a bit delayed and unacceptable to the point that we decided to put our IVF on hold due to communication issues between the insurance/billing office and our insurance. I would say that a patient has to do all the legwork between the insurance and the clinic, and it can get quite complicated and unfortunately, the clinic does not offer too much guidance, so you are really on your own. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Strengths: the clinic is clean, presentable, state of the art, accessible. They do have really good doctors that listen and seem to care when you are with them (time is limited however as they all seem to have a heavy caseload). The front desk/reception is friendly and helpful once you get to know them. They offer genetic counseling (we took advantage of it and the counselor was very informative and helpful, glad we did this). 
Weakness: when it comes to billing and insurance the patient is left on their own to tackle. When we first joined we could communicate with the clinic via email (where we could email in questions, paperwork, etc.) however in the past year they switch out to everything being handled via phone. The assigned nurse we got also refused to communicate via email preferring to do so via phone. This did not work for us due to work/school commitments, so having email communication was preferred. Another weakness would have to be that information (in our case insurance pre-requirements for IVF) never got to the right person in time, so the patient was left to do multiple follow-ups with several people about the same thing. I wish the office would be better coordinated. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Luckily all of our IUI's were covered by my insurance.

He was always present at appointments (meaning mentally), checked to make sure I was doing okay, made sure all my questions were answered, and went the extra mile to make sure things were seamless.

He was always responsive when I reached out and took the time to answer any questions I had when I had appointments.

Dr. Davis was generous with his time. After we became his patient, we could schedule a visit with him within a week of when we called for an appointment he also followed up all phone calls to his office and provided time on the phone to answer my questions. Even though Cornell is a group practice, it was obvious that Dr. Davis was making the decisions about the day to day changes in my cycles. He adjusted his schedule so he was the physician who completed the retrieval for both of my cycles with him.  While I have not been successful with him and we are moving on to donor eggs, I had the best experience with cycles with him. 

 I felt like an individual patient with him rather than just someone who the standard  protocol was not working for them. He was very engaged with adjusting the cycle. We did day 3 transfer, which was not offered by our prior RE, we also tried a co-cultured cycle with him. He was always very truthful in his expectations of success and we never felt like he was trying to sell us or convince of a procedure that he did not believe would potentially improve the cycle.

He definitely is not forthcoming when it comes to providing information and a treatment plan, he only provides bits and pieces as time goes along, I think that is the case because he really studies you as a patient and makes decisions as things progress and he makes adjustments accordingly. I would definitely be going back for future pregnancy help.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I would tell a future patient to not expect that Dr Rosenwaks would ""hold your hand"" through the process and as hard as it is just to just simply trust him.

We attempted the same a 2nd round and it was a negative test. After that, I pleaded to start IVF because I knew that would more likely be successful and I was impatient. He was on board and he gave me extremely low doses of the stimulation drugs to prevent on complications. He is very cautious.

Dr. Reichman took a very close look at why I was miscarrying and noticed two separate issues that other doctors had missed.

I realize this is the process for new patients to rule out all possibilities of why you are infertile, but I felt a little dismissed since I came to him with a mound of paperwork from previous doctors. I guess I more expected him to go over my history and perhaps see if something from my past was causing the issues. 

Everything came back normal and unfortunately I was diagnosed with unexplained infertility and I was to start Clomid. I am the type who wants to know everything, and when it is happening, but I felt like it was very hard to get answers. He didn't explain the process or next steps, and at my next appointment I was told I would be getting an IUI and my husband needed to be available. I was so overwhelmed. I felt like i relied more on friends for answers, than the doctor. 

Also, the office at Cornell caused me the most stress of the entire process.

When my first 2 transfers didn’t take (with other doctors that were scheduled on those days), Dr. Reichman made sure to perform my third transfer himself, and now I have a wonderful baby boy as a result. 

Dr. Reichman never hesitates to level with you (always with compassion) about what’s going on and what you’re expectations should be. I loved that about him, but you must be prepared to potentially face hard truths. 

One last thing... Dr. Reichman is incredibly responsive by email, which is wonderful considering the number of questions that can come up as part of the process.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Don’t hesitate to make an appointment with him and take his advice on a plan of action!</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Reichman was just wonderful.

I immediately began my transfer cycles after my 2 retrieval cycles, and unfortunately the first two transfers didn’t take (they were natural transfers - single embryo).

He is also a bit more cautious, which I personally preferred...slow, steady and ultimately successful. I was blessed to deliver my daughter in 2013 and am now pregnant with #2 - to which I owe Dr. G all the credit in the world. 

The one red flag for me was the fact that neither he nor his nursing staff ever identified my weight as an obstacle. My weight, at one point, dropped dangerously low and was never once flagged as an issue/nor was it ever mentioned that I should be seeking help before continuing to cycle.

WARRIOR REVIEW</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Be prepared that you will not see Dr. G at every monitoring appointment. BUT, you can always schedule time with him.

Also, Dr. G takes a more cautious approach to treatment and protocols. If you are looking for an innovator or someone very aggressive, he may not be the right doctor for you.

WARRIOR REVIEW</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Cornell's practice as a whole is more like a factory. You sit in a packed waiting room every day with countless other women, see a rotation of nurses and fellows and don;t really build warm relationships with staff. The transfer/retrieval process is even worse - sitting for hours in a small waiting room wearing nothing but a robe, watching other women go in and out of the operating room, etc. It is not a warm and fuzzy place.

Dr. G himself, on the other hand, is very warm and caring. He called me personally both times I miscarried, had an open door policy, and always remembered small tidbits I had shared. I think he is a wonderful doctor - his personality doesn't jive with the setting.

WARRIOR REVIEW</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">My protocols remained fairly similar each time, as I was responding well to meds.

For all IUIs, I was on either menopur or follistim - &amp;gt; 5th IUI resulted in a successful pregnancy.

</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I found the nursing staff at Cornell to be hit or miss. Some of the nurses are super on top of things, promptly return phone calls, and are great at building a a semblance of a relationship.

Others have been awful, providing incorrect instructions, taking forever to call back, seeming very overworked and stressed.

The nurses also rotate so frequently that it is hard to build real, caring relationships. And, it is extremely frustrating that you can NEVER reach anyone directly.

WARRIOR REVIEW</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Cornell is like a factory - but they are highly successful. You must be super prepared to be a self advocate and follow up on EVERYTHING - from billing, to questions for nurses, to staying on top of your protocol and meds.

The environment leaves much to be desired, with the awkwardness of the waiting rooms [in clinic and in hospital], lack of anonymity, lack of any type of patent coordinator.

i stuck with the practice only because I loved my doctor.

I had just done two FETs that were unsuccessful and wasn't sure what to do next since my embryos were in DC and I was living in NYC and felt like maybe I needed more extensive treatments and didn't want to travel to DC for them. Dr. Reichman was great about taking over my case and helping me feel like I wasn't alone in my struggles. He determined that I needed to have another hysteroscopy because the shape of my uterus was still abnormal and he thought that another hysteroscopy might fix the thinness issue and fluid issue (I had already had 4 hysteroscopies at this point - complicated story). I was hopeful that removing any remaining scarring would solve the issues. Another doctor I had seen for 3 of the previous hysteroscopies didn't think that removing additional scarring would help. He thought the uterus was good enough as is structurally but that I was now having a functional issue with my response to estrogen. I was willing to go with Dr. Reichman's plan since I had just had 2 unsuccessful FETs after working on the functional issue with estrogen therapy and wanted to try something new. Dr. Reichman did my 5th hysteroscopy. It did not go as planned. Dr. Reichman said my uterus was completely scarred shut, he didn't cut away any scars because it was too risky, and he couldn't place even a pediatric balloon in there. I was so so upset about this result. I mean I knew I had some scarring on the left side but I didn't think it was that severe - had I really just done 2 FETs of good embryos to a uterus that was completely scarred shut? We decided to do a 6th hysteroscopy with Dr. Reichman and his colleague Dr. Schattman one month later. I think Dr. Reichman liked the plan of collaborating with Dr. Schattman since he wanted what he was seeing to be confirmed by a colleague. This hysteroscopy went well - the big scar on the left that we knew about was removed and a balloon was placed. The second procedure at Cornell was successful in that my uterus appeared to be a normal shape one month later on saline ultrasound. However, after taking letrozole for a month and then clomid the following month to see what my lining would look like at ovulation time (a mock natural cycle), it was determined that there was nothing left to do about my thin uterine lining and fluid issues. If my lining had looked good either of those cycles, we would have scheduled another FET. Because it didn't look good (4mm-ish plus fluid), my husband and I had sex around ovulation (no pregnancy resulting). I think Dr. Reichman didn't actually go into my uterus during that first hysteroscopy; I think he went into the muscle under my uterus (something called a ""false passage""). I brought this up after the first hysteroscopy with him and he didn't think that was what happened. And we didn't really talk about it after the second hysteroscopy. I think we were both just really hopeful that the second hysteroscopy would fix my problems. Oh my goodness. Doctors are really just people and hysteroscopies are mysteries. All I know is that I was counseled to pursue a gestational carrier during those dark days after the first hysteroscopy and that was actually a good thing because I started the process of coming to terms with my uterus really not being something that I can fix. Wish we'd had better results, but I think I've tried the functional issue approach and I've tried the structural issue approach and neither seems to have worked so I am moving on. In summary, I didn't get the results I wanted, but I still think Dr. Reichman is a good doctor and a good person too.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I don't have any advice. He's great because he's very accessible but also part of a state of the art practice. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Reichman is very kind and caring. I went to him because a friend recommended him. She liked his bedside manner. I also liked his bedside manner. I could tell that our visits truly affected him and that he felt genuinely sad for me when he had to give me bad news. I think he teared up while talking to me and said some really nice things like ""You will get your second child."" It was all very human. And the Cornell practice overall felt like a state of the art facility plus individualized care so that's a great combo.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I think I described them above. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I didn't really deal with the nursing staff that much. I mostly communicated directly with Dr. Reichman in person or over email for my issues. I actually went to Dr. Reichman specifically because I wanted ONE person who would be dealing with my thin uterine lining plus fluid situation. I was really tired of seeing different doctors and nurses each of whom would invariably say something different and bad about my uterus and didn't really understand my medical history.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I'm repeating myself - I think the strength of a place like Cornell is that you are going to get a lot of individualized attention from your doctor plus a state of the art medical facility. Also the doctors there confer with each other which is great. You really can't go wrong at Cornell.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Most of my treatments were medical (Asherman's Syndrome) and not ART and therefore covered by my insurance. Cornell happens to be covered but not in-network so I was paying higher co-pays, etc. Also we switched insurance mid-year and had to meet our deductible so I did end up paying several thousand dollars for my care (the hysteroscopies were about $500 each), but it was not unreasonable. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I believe Dr. Reichman is pro eSET. </div>]"

He did the surgery to remove that tube and ended up removing the left tube as well, as it was also diseased and he did not want it to cause another miscarriage (I had one a year ago, likely due to the blocked tube). He did an excellent job on my surgery - I had laparoscopic surgery years ago to remove my ovary due to a dermoid cyst, and my recovery was MUCH worse then. I had very little pain and healed quickly after the surgery. We started IVF the next month. Dr. Elias did my retrieval even though he wasn't scheduled to do so (he was on call in the office) which I really appreciated. There was a possibility I was going to need to have a trans-abdominal retrieval and he wanted to be the one to do it. Thankfully, that did not happen and I ended up having 8 eggs, which was much higher than either of us expected. We had also expected to need to do a day 3 transfer, but we were able to do a day 5 transfer of a fresh embryo and then freeze the remaining 3. Unfortunately, the transfer was not successful. We plan on trying a frozen transfer with the remaining embryos and are hopeful we will have success in the coming months. I really like Dr. Elias - I find him to be very statistics focused, and he is well-read about all of the current research. My only complaint is that sometimes I find him a bit hard to understand as he has a bit of an accent and speaks quickly. However, that has not impacted my care in any way. I highly recommend him!</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I did not realize that I would need to go to the Upper East Side office so often - you have to go there for all procedures, classes and weekend monitoring.

That being said, I like having access to the Cornell team but able to see Dr. Elias in the Mt. Kisco office which is smaller and less intimidating and factory-like than the UES office.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Elias knew me and my situation and I never felt like a number. His staff in Mt Kisco also knew me and they were all very kind and helpful.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I used 225 UI of Follistim and 150 of Menopur and then added in Ganirelix towards the end of my stim cycle.

I saw her once at my initial meeting and then during weekend monitoring, I ran into her in the blood work room. She remembered me and was very sweet.

I also interacted a lot with Jessica and Joanne at the Mt. Kisco office and they are both lovely.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I really like going to the Mt.

I also really like that I saw Dr. Elias every time I was there, as I know many others who did not have that experience of seeing their specific doctor. My only complaint was that I didn't realize I would have to go to the UES office so much - and the parking there is super expensive, and the drive can be challenging.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">If I was going in for monitoring at Mt.

I work at a school and I'm supposed to be in at 8:15, so I needed to go in early; however, on a day when I didn't have to work I went in later and the wait was not bad at all.

When my husband and I showed up at his office with an unexpected severe MFI diagnosis, we were in a bit of shock and did not know what to expect. He was kind and empathetic, but did not spend much time on exploring why or how this issue came about. Had we been hoping to attempt to fix the problem naturally (or get satisfying answers) before moving on to ART, this might have been a problem for us. But we were looking for the fastest and most efficient route to a baby and Dr. Spandorfer ( very appropriately and capably) focused his attention his areas of expertise and helping us move forward quickly. While our interaction with Dr. Spandorfer during our fresh cycle was fairly limited (due to Cornell's pooled monitoring/procedure method), I felt like he was reachable if I had any questions and knew that he was the one reviewing my file daily and making the important calls. When our first cycle was successful but ended in a miscarriage, Dr. Spandorfer showed much more compassion than I expected for a doctor at a high volume fertility clinic (and more than I had gotten from any of my regular obgyns in the past) and became our single point of contact for all future appointments and procedures. While it is true that he is very efficient and aware of keeping to a schedule, this benefits his patients and I never found him unwilling to spend time if i had questions or engage in friendly conversation.

Resulted in positive pregnancy test but subsequent 1st trimester miscarriage.

As everyone notes, it runs very smoothly for a high volume clinic and the staff, doctors, equipment and facilities are all top notch. Monitoring hours are early enough that I was rarely late to work. Its true that it is not a hand holding clinic. I watched Freedom Med Teach tutorials on injections, researched the protocols my doctor had me on, called the nursing staff if I was unclear on any instructions and was reached out if i had any questions or concerns that weren't addressed in regular interactions. The need for self-initiative did not bother me personally.

My first IVF cycle, I was taking 300 Gonal-f + 150 menopur, which resulted in only 2 follicles and a canceled IVF. We ended up doing another IUI instead, which was also unsuccessful. For my second IVF cycle, my dosage was reduced to 225 Gonal-F, and 75 menopur, later adding cetrotide before retrieval.

I was an out-of-town patient which made communication and remote testing complicated at times. That said, Dr. Pfeifer had at one point provided me her cell number and has since allowed me to text her- though I try to respect her privacy and do so sparingly. I did, however, find this to be especially helpful at times when I needed something urgent, or in the event I was unable to get through to her via e-mail or get through to one of the nurses or on-call physicians (weekends, nights, etc.) The shear fact that she trusted me with giving me her cell number shows how much she cared for me as her patient.  We had success after a frozen blastocyst transfer in June of this year, after a failed fresh 3-day transfer in March (2nd IVF cycle), and failed TESE/initial IVF cycle with a frozen embryo transfer. Dr. Pfeifer is always very approachable with questions, but at times, it seems she struggles to keep up with her large patient load as it can take multiple attempts to get a hold of her. That said, she is always more than willing to help and listen when you do! It requires a lot of patience and persistence, but worth it when you do get through to her.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Persistence is key when getting through to her directly. Due to the high volume nature of the clinic, you really have to be your own advocate as everyone is vying for time with her. Being in high demand is not a bad problem to have, but wish that Cornell would hire more physicians to lower the patient to provider ratio.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Cornell in general is a high volume clinic so that alone can make you feel like you are a number, however, whenever I had 1:1 time with Dr. Pfeifer by phone or in person, she always made you feel important and valued.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The first IVF cycle, we used injectables (Follistim, Ganirelix, and Menopur). The second cycle we were able to use what we learned from a failed frozen cycle to modify my protocol to produce better results. During IVF round 2, we went with a lower initial dose and continued that dose for a majority of the time, which while it sounds counter-intuitive, produced almost double the number of eggs retrieved (16). It was somewhat discouraging to find out that only half of the eggs were ""mature"", but we had two 8 and 7 cell embryos transferred and another which made it to Day 5/6 to freeze, which ended up being the one that worked.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Evangeline was, for the most part, great to work with! I got to know her after our FOT cycle and continued working with her on our second IVF cycle. She was typically responsive to my calls and emails, more so than the first nurse I had been assigned with our TESE and first egg retrieval. She once called someone else and left them a message with my protocol, which was concerning. I addressed it with Dr. Pfeifer and she addressed it with her. During our 2nd IVF cycle, Dr. Pfeifer had made a last minute addition of Lupron to my protocol, and due to insurance and timing, I was going to have to pay out-of-pocket for it from a local pharmacy. Evangeline was able to locate some in storage at the clinic and provided it to me free of charge.

One of the downsides of the nursing team is that they are all located at the Upper East Side location, so if you are seeing Dr. Pfeifer in Tribeca, you might not get to meet/see Evangeline in person.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Beautiful and comfortable state-of-the-art facilities. Tribeca is often a lot more efficient when it comes to bloodwork and ultrasound. Make sure you do your homework and get pre-certified if your insurance requires it. Sometimes you feel like a number during morning monitoring, but in my opinion, it also helps you feel reassured that you're going to a place where lots of others are trusting them with their care. Even if you don't get to see your doc. for monitoring, the other physicians I have also liked are Dr. Schattman, Dr. Kang and Dr. Melnick. Be advised that your physician likely won't do your egg retrieval or transfer as they all rotate OR days so it just depends which day you're ready and you'll get the doctor on-call.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Pretty painless at Tribeca office.

Only 1 of 6 was of good enough quality to freeze, so in hindsight was the right decision.

He was blunt, cut me off so abruptly when I misunderstood something and seemed irritated. No compassion at all, just told me like he was giving the weather and left me sitting there with my pants off on the table as he rushed to the next patient. I felt so vulnerable and it was awful. He was however, always willing to have me come back to do a sonogram and blood tests. I was clear from day one that I was against donor conception for very personal reasons. He not once, not twice, but three times pushed it after I was 100% straightforward that I'd either not have children or adopt if that was my only option.

He is always responsive to my concerns and questions and provides straightforward and honest answers (he is not one to sugar coat).

I can't recommend him highly enough.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Do not wait to make an appointment - if you want to see him, the sooner the better.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Even though the practice at CRM is huge, everyone I met with treated me with respect and kindness. There are literally hundreds of patients waiting in the monitoring room each day yet I did not encounter any frustrated doctors, nurses, or other staff. Whenever I met with Dr. Davis, he was completely up to speed on my treatment.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I started a protocol of 300 cc follistim, 150 menopur for the first 12 days of my cycle - around day 8 as I was getting ready for the retrieval, he prescribed ganirelix to prevent me from ovulating. I was monitored every day or every other day with blood work and then ultrasounds. I did not have any side effects, which I am so grateful for. I was triggered on day 13 and retrieved on day 15, closely following my natural cycle. Dr. Davis retrieved 14 eggs, 11 of which were mature. Of the 11, 8 fertilized with ICSI, and 5 went on to be blastocysts. I transferred a single embryo on day 5 - prior to the retrieval we discussed my desire to transfer just 1 embryo if possible. I was thrilled to get a positive blood pregnancy test on day 28, and now have an additional 4 embryos frozen for future use. Dr. Davis did not recommend genetic testing in my case because of family history and age; he explained that it was an additional step to freeze and unfreeze the embryos and that in my circumstances, the risks were not worth doing it.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Katie is an excellent nurse and always answered my questions within a few hours. She is super thorough and organized - nothing ever fell through the cracks with her. I saw her frequently, but other nurses often did the blood work monitoring or ultrasounds. They were all great. Like Dr. Davis, Katie was always completely up to speed on my treatment, which reassured me that my case was being followed personally.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Many other patients have described CRM as a well-oiled machine. It is, which, when it comes to IVF, is a great thing. Having experienced both kind of clinics - more personal vs more automatic - I prefer this environment. Everyone is super nice and professional, but the automation keeps things moving smoothly. With this volume of patients, everything has to be timed to the minute. Despite the high volume, the obvious compassion and level of training from everyone - the billing team, receptionists, nurses, doctors - makes you feel like a person.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Super efficient. I do not live close to the clinic in Manhattan (I am about 2 hours away) so it was a pain sometimes getting there in the morning before 8:30. However, I never had to wait long to see someone (less than 15 minutes) and was always in and out. Everyone super nice and professional. Usually there are between 75-100 people waiting. The Mount Kisco location is closer to my house, but unfortunately not as efficient. I think they only have 1-2 nurses there, and usually only 5-10 people waiting, but much longer wait times (usually 30 minutes or more).</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Medications - $14,000; IVF - $10,500; ICSI - $2,700; Hospital Fee - $1800; Embryo cryopreservation - $1100 per year; Individual consultations/visits with Dr. Davis - $550 each, probably around 6-8 of those total including initial consultation and follow up after achieving pregnancy</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">In my first consultation with Dr. Davis, I expressed to him that I wanted to transfer just 1 embryo if possible. He noted my wishes and said that realistically he could transfer either 1 or 2, but it depended on the embryos themselves: how many were fertilized, and how they looked on day 3 post-fertilization. This made sense, and post retrieval he and my nurse Katie kept me aware of how they were doing and how likely a day 5 transfer would be. Happily, 5 embryos made it to day 3 and looked good enough to wait until day 5 for a single embryo transfer.</div>]"

If she is not there you will see the other doctor she shares the office with. Once we moved from IUI to IVF I felt more like a human - and more attention was paid to my case. The monitoring hours are very rushed and you don't have the chance to ask questions or get detailed answers from her - but you get a call from your nurse every day after blood work and ultrasound and they are great resources for questions.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">We had unexplained infertility which is so vague and annoying that its even a ""diagnosis"". I did the HSG scan, blood work, genetic testing and my husband did seamen analysis - all came back good. We then did two rounds on clomid, with IUIs - one with trigger shot - and one round of letrezol with IUI. All were unsuccessful. I went for daily monitoring and blood during all three cycles. When we moved to IVF I had more ultrasounds, and then moved to injectables: Gonal F,  Menapur, Gonarelex with a trigger shot. I also took some antibiotics. We opted for ICSI, and the embryos were transferred day 3. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The nurse was nice and called every day as expected. She always had the information I needed and would answer questions. The one major issue is you can almost never get her one the phone if you miss a call or have an adhoc question.

The set times for monitoring are nice if you need to schedule but the walk in times are also good b/c you can get in early before work. On the weekends you have to go to the main building on the UES and it can be very crowded in there.

He also understood that finances played a part in our decisions and helped us decide to not waste any more money on IUIs since we have no insurance coverage our money was better spent on IVF. When I was having a hard time with the nurses he put me in touch with a head nurse to oversee my case which made me feel like he heard my complaint and really tried to fix the situation.

Goldschlag suggested we not waste any time since my husband and I had been trying on our own for a year. I felt he took the time to really look for any causes -he saw a slightly misshapen uterus and then sent me for an MRI which helped to rule out some factors. We did 3 IUIs with injectables and then moved on to IVF at Goldschlag's recommendation. We did our egg retrieval and have transferred one bastocyst and are currently in the dreaded TWW. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Shanice the coordinator is somewhat cold in the beginning but I think it's party due to the sheer volume of patients she has to coordinate. I did not like the fact that I ALWAYS had to leave a voicemail and then was called back. I never got a live person. This was extremely frustrating for me. I would have preferred some form for email ability since these are personal calls and very difficult to take in a small work office setting.   Half way through I was assigned a new nurse and had a terrible first experience with her. I told goldschlag about not and he addressed it with her and we worked through the problem. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The strength is that they have great labs and great doctors. The negatives is that it is a total factory. If you are looking for a lot of hand holding through the process this is NOT the pace for you.

She was also able to spend more time with me when I had an appointment as opposed to the monitoring visits.

I do wish I had more time to spend with Dr. Kang, but she did encourage me with my personal situation from the get-go.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Don't expect to have long appointments with her. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The place is definitely a factory, so the face-to-face time is usually quite short. Dr. Kang, however, is very good at still making me feel like she knows who I am. She's always very warm.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I started with natural IUIs because I have regular cycles and had good ovarian reserve etc. My ""advanced"" age is a factor we considered throughout as well as being single. 

I tried IUIs three times and all failed. I used donor sperm so my egg quality was seen as a factor. I had a blocked Fallopian tube as well, but after repeating the test, it eventually opened. To help with egg quality, she recommended I try CoQ10.

We were going to try a medicated IUI, but based on my attempts, my age and egg quality, we went to IVF after failed IUI #3. I am just starting that cycle but it is much more complicated. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Jennifer (IUI nurse) was great. She was usually available when I called or at least gave me a call back that same day. Super organised and willing to answer my questions without rushing me off the phone.

Diana, the care coordinator was also super helpful and she worked pretty seamlessly with Jennifer to schedule my IUIs and other appointments.

The IVF team is different and I am just getting started there. The nurse I was assigned, Sarah, is different from Jennifer and a bit less warm and more ""rushy"". While I haven't had many interactions with her yet, so far I am not as satisfied as I was with the IUI nurse. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">It's so busy. Monitoring hours are between 6:30 and 8:30 am so the waiting room is usually crowded. The staff is good about getting everyone checked in quickly and the nurses are constantly calling patients in so there is movement in the ""line"", but you just have to wait. The nurses drawing blood are quite skilled so the blood work is usually quick and painless. The system works like clockwork.

The IUI scheduling didn't work out that great for me. They tell you to arrive by 8:30am, which is when the andrology lab opens. From there, if you are using frozen sperm, it is an hour-long thawing process, but it can be a long wait. For one IUI, I didn't actually get into the room for the IUI until after 10:30am (which I did not expect) so I was stressed out. I saw at least two other women in the waiting room who were also complaining about waiting for a long time. I don't know what they were in for, however.

I would recommend that if you have other obligations, try to reschedule those obligations for hours later or another day if you go for an IUI.

This did not work for me as I work full time in client service and can't be available when a nurse decides to call me back. There was no email or online portal. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Cornell certainly has a factory feel to it. I felt the front desk was quite rude or dense sometimes; for instance I once was told to come in for a blood draw but wasn't told what time to come in. I called and asked if I could come anytime and specified that I was on my way in as we spoke. When I arrived ten minutes later they told me that they actually close for lunch between 12 and 1pm. Other times I would go in and the front desk would act annoyed by me checking in or tell me that I was at the wrong check-in desk of the two available as if this is something I'm just supposed to know. 

The monitoring hours are early and a narrow window - they were 6:30 to 8:30 am on weekdays when I went here. This wasn't convenient for me personally. 

The worst part about my experience was the poor communication between staff and patients. There was no online portal or email; you had to leave a voicemail for your nurse coordinator and then wait for her to call you back at a random time during the day when you may or may not be available. It was maddening for anyone trying to balance a busy work life with fertility treatments as well as being ineffective. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">100% covered by insurance </div>]"

The downside of having monitoring hours only from 6:30-9am means that the wait could be long. I tended to go on the later end of monitoring, closer to 9am, so my time there was about 20-30 minutes. There have been times I've waited close to an hour for monitoring.  The clinic is clean, spacious, and well-run.  If I needed to talk to billing, they would try to accommodate me while I was there.  There is also a genetic counselor in the office.  Cornell also closes down for a couple of weeks, two times a year, June and December.  This is to recalibrate all their equipment.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">monitoring hours were from 6:30am - 9am. I had flexibility with my schedule so that allowed me to go later.  the wait was about 20-30 minutes usually, with busy days up to an hour.  i would prefer more flexible hours.  the volume of patients here is so high that there are women waiting in line as early as 6am.  The nurses call out your name when it's your turn, but the waiting area is so big, sometimes you can't hear them. And sometimes I was afraid to use the restroom in fear that I'd miss them calling my name. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">approximate total for one round of IVF cost me about $22,000+.  That includes medications which were around $5-6k. I was able to lower the estimated medication costs of $8K but receiving donations from friends that had unused medications.  To use the hospital at NY Presbyterian (for retrievals and transfer) cost an additional $1100.  The cycle itself cost about $10K, then additional fees for ICSI, embryo culture, egg freezing, and some other items I can't remember.  </div>]"

On day 2 of the following cycle I began IVF injections. For 4 days I took 150IU Menopur and150IU Gonal F. On the 5th day we added a Ganirelix injection (to make sure one egg did not become overly dominant and cause ovulation) and that continued through the 9th day. On the 10th day of injections (Day 11 of my cycle) I took 40 units of Lupron and 5,000 units of HCG (to ensure ovulation).

The egg retrieval took place on day 13. 21 eggs were collected, 15 of those were mature and all 15 were successfully fertilized with ICSI (ICSI aids in the fertilization process and often produces better results than just laying the sperm on the eggs). 

We then waited 5 days to see how many embryos survived so we could send them in for PGS testing. It is necessary to wait until the embryos grow to a certain amount of cells so they can be biopsied. 

We then waited 2 weeks for the PGS results (1 out of 12 embryos can back unaffected with out genetic issue). 

On my next cycle Dr. Schattman did a natural frozen embryo transfer, he explained that in the absence of any other fertility issues natural transfers tend to have the best odds. I had a positive pregnancy test 6 days after my transfer which resulted in one live birth of a healthy baby boy.

What she failed to discover was that I do indeed have a mild case of PCOS. She was aware that my younger sister had a strong case of PCOS and never bothered to run any additional diagnostic blood work (testosterone levels, hemoglobin a1c), which are suggestive that I have it. If she had not been so dismissive, my issues might have been treated simply with metformin. Instead, I had 5 unsuccessful cycles with her over the course of a year. Complete waste of time. 

In addition, when it came to my thyroid, which was slightly elevated, she started me off on too high of a dose. When we later dialed it back, my body had become resistant to the lower dose. She should have been more measured in treating this condition.

I took 100 mg of Clomid from days 4-8, then went in for a saline sonogram (not the normal course of action in an IUI, but they had to make sure my uterus was clear of scar tissue from my previous c-section) on Day 10.  At Day 10 they noted that my follicles were large, but my lining had some catching up to do.  I went back in for monitoring on day 11, they drew blood, saw my lining had grown a bit more and my follicles had gotten bigger.  I was called that day and directed to take an Ovidrel trigger shot on the evening of day 11.  I had an IUI on the morning of day 13.  Two weeks later, I had beta blood levels drawn and got a positive.  Dr. Pfeifer had me come in for two ultrasounds - one to confirm an intrauterine pregnancy at 5 weeks, and another to confirm viability (fetal heartbeat) around 7 weeks.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Evangeline, or sometimes Devon, would call with any instructions or explanations and they were always very clear.

This is important because you don't often see your own doctor - you see whomever is in charge of monitoring hours on a given morning, and the doctor who does your retrieval is whomever happens to be on call that day.  So I only saw Dr. Davis for my initial consult and one time when he happened to be doing monitoring hours.  But I thought that all of the nurses and doctors at Cornell were excellent.  Everything went exactly as described, all of the staff were 100% on top of giving me clear instructions every day, and I never had to wonder what was going on or feel like I didn't know what to do next.

Dr. Davis himself is great.  He took a lot of time to explain the options to me, and provided data on probability of success in detailed terms that I really appreciated.  I am a scientifically oriented person, and I found that a few other doctors who I consulted with really glossed over the data, when I wanted to hear hard credible facts.  Dr. Davis respected me and provided the information I wanted.  He is compassionate but also got right to the point.  And most importantly, I have full trust in his medical abilities.  I was never scared that I was going to be overstimulated, because Dr. Davis and his team made it seem like they were doing an excellent job of monitoring me closely.  

I was not a complicated case, so maybe this isn't all due to Dr. Davis' skill, but I got a beautiful result, more than I even expected, with basically no side effects.  I was just thrilled that I decided to do elective egg retrieval and freezing, and I would 110% recommend Dr. Davis and Cornell to anyone else considering it.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Set aside time to do some research on where to obtain the drugs - first have the Cornell nurse call them in to see if your health insurance will cover them, and if not, research a pharmacy with the best retail price.

It took that cycle to discover I needed a trigger to ovulate, and we repeated Clomid 100mg+TI the next cycle, when I successfully ovulated.  The following cycle we stepped up to IUI.  Our 3rd cycle with Dr. Spandorfer I didn't respond to the initial dose of 100mg so was bumped up to 200mg (I think?) and did ovulate, again IUI.  In December, continuing with 200mg/IUI I had visual disturbances on the Clomid, which Dr. Spandorfer took very seriously, and gave me the IVF talk. Due to my very high AMH, he was not open to doing injects IUIs with me, so we went to IVF+ICSI after our final IUI cycle was a bust.  We did a standard antagonist protocol with ICSI.  Started at 125iu FSH, went down after bloodwork monitoring, then back up, then down again, added in 1 vial Menopur/day after about 5-6 days, along with Ganirelix.  Triggered with 5,000iu hCG.  23 retrieved, all 23 mature, which I think says something very impressive about Dr. Spandorfer's management of my crazy PCOS ovaries.  16 fertilized with ICSI (which is around the 70% fert rate ""they"" look for with ICSI).  I developed mild OHSS ahead of the transfer, but Dr. Spandorfer had me come in for close monitoring to ensure the transfer would be safe.  We did a 5dt of one blastocyst (Dr. Chung did it - he was lovely and very encouraging) and were able to freeze an additional 7.   I realized I was successfully pregnant when my OHSS returned (moderate this time - incredibly unpleasant).  The upside of the OHSS was that I got a bunch of early ultrasounds to confirm an intrauterine pregnancy by 4 weeks 6 days, onward. I was released to the care of my OB by 7+ weeks, and the result is my almost 4-month-old daughter who's sleeping in her crib as I type this.

The only negative aspect of my experience was that I felt he considered me as an easy case since I was young and did not investigate why I was not getting pregnant before starting me on fertility treatment.

He also did surgery to remove my right tube - and i have recovered with no issues and the tiniest scares.

Weaknesses: During what was the most painful (physically and emotionally) time - during my ectopic pregnancy - he hardly checked in on me, I felt totally in the dark, he was very cavalier about surgery vs. drugs to remove, and once the surgery was over didn't call to check up on me that night or the next day. I had a very bad reaction to anesthesia and the hospital was forcing me to leave…if he had called i'm sure they would have treated me differently. And then when I got home I was panicked that I felt so bad, was bleeding, etc - and felt like I didn't know what to expect/what was normal/what wasn't.

Right now I'm deciding if I want to stay with him for future treatment or see someone else in the practice.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Realize this is a first for many of us - the struggle, the delight, the disappointment - and to be better about communicating with patients - giving them the general context, the options and the details.

Like when I first found out my pregnancy was not viable and I would miscarry he said ""This is a good thing -you can get pregnant"" - or when I later had to have surgery for what was an ectopic pregnancy he seemed very cavalier about removing the tube.

Literally, actually.  The waiting room had natural light coming from big windows as opposed to being a cramped crowded dark space space. The facility was clean with new looking equipment as opposed to the other facility I'd been a patient at.  And I found Cornell to be much more efficiently run.   To answer the number versus human question a bit more directly, Spandorfer was really not phased by my high FSH  and low antral follicle count. Unlike my doctor at my previous clinic, Spandorfer told me he would be willing to go ahead to retrieval even if we only managed to produce one bag he said it was my decision.  That made me feel like he respected my agency and like he wasn't fixated on statistics. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response""> I'm a bit hazy on the protocol specifics.

One thing I noticed it was different from the other clinic I attended is that they would call you up for monitoring by first and last name.  The other clinic would just use first names presumably for anonymity.  I found that kind of stupid because of course you could see the person, so if you know them you know that they're there for infertility.  But I also found the use of first names only at the other office in the monitoring hours to be subtly infantilizing.  It did mean at Cornell that I noticed a colleague was there and I might not of noticed that she was there if she hadn't been called up to the desk by first and last name.  But I didn't think this was a big deal since obviously were all in the same situation so it's not like I'm going to go gossiping to our mutual colleagues that she was at my infertility clinic, thus outing myself as a fellow infertile.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response""> I have insurance from the state of Massachusetts --"" Romney care ""-- which provides excellent coverage so I was not too aware of the price per procedure .</div>, <div class=""review-question__response""> We had a different doctor for the transfer I think his name was Dr. Cho . I was in the surgery room and he said something like, ""Did Dr. Spandorfer talk to you about transferring one or two embryos?""

It was a process, and my husband and I felt like Dr. Kang was on our team. When the first IVF transfer took but then ended in a chemical pregnancy, we were sad and frustrated, but Dr. Kang made us feel like there was always a plan, always a goal to focus on, and we would just keep adjusting the plan until we reached our goal.

I wasn't looking for a therapist or a friend, I was looking for a doctor who would guide us through this process and work with us until we got there.

We felt like she gave us all the information we needed to make decisions and keep moving forward; she didn't confuse us, and she was able to relay info and options to us in a way that we completely understood, even if it was complicated. She thoughtfully answered every question we ever asked, no matter how silly or basic.

He then told me that since I was now over 45 and had even worse ovarian function, getting pregnant with my own eggs would now be virtually impossible, and I should consider adoption or donor eggs.  

I agreed to move to donor eggs, but said that while we were doing all we needed to do to make that happen, I wanted to go back to doing unmedicated IUIs on every possible cycle I could, so as not to waste even a single, potentially good egg while waiting.  He agreed to do it because I insisted, but swore it would never work.

During our first visit we explained our previous history of a chemical pregnancy and a miscarriage and were concerned that there was a problem with me holding onto pregnancies. Dr. Pereira was quick to explain that was not the case and that it is common for a single miscarriage to happen. Post minor hiccups with the billing department we were then stuck by our insurance not covering for our IUI's but just TI (Timed Intercourse) cycles before we could graduate to IVF. Dr Pereira again also discussed the denial of the IUI authorization with the insurance. Once we were sure that IUI's wont be covered we started with the TI cycles and the first 2 cycles were negative and I was starting to lose hope but Dr Pererira assured that it was just a matter of time. Luckily, we were able to get a positive result on the 3rd round of treatment and I am currently at 13 weeks. During our visits to the clinic Dr Pereira showed warmth and excellent bedside manners and was very sensitive when relaying messages of failure during the first 2 attempts. He was always available over email to answer any queries or concerns that we had and would always reply within few hours even over the weekend. Overall I strongly vouch for Dr. Pererira and was sad to leave his office when we graduated at 10 weeks to our OB-GYN. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Trust him completely, he knows his job very well and you will be in excellent hands during this journey.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">With Dr Pereira, we had a refreshing change in the way we were treated than our previous clinic.

Dr Pereira never failed to show excellent bedside manners during all our visits and was also very sensitive in conveying news that our first 2 cycles were not positive. He never treated us like a number and even suggested us to not redo the same tests which were done on us by the previous clinic a short while ago.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">With a history of PCOS and after 3 failed IUI attempts , were not sure if we should directly jump to IVF. Due to the huge costs associated we wanted to give TI/IUI few tries and Dr Pereira completely supported this decision.

Once the egg was of a suitable size we used to self-administer Ovidrel injections as advised by the doctor or nurse. The 3rd cycle TI cyle yielded a positive result.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Chrystal was our nurse during the treatment but we co-ordinate only on phone.

He made it clear from day one that ours would be an uphill battle and that he would be with us every step of the way. He outlined our challenges, was very candid about success rates, and asked thoughtful questions to guide us toward an action plan. Each visit from that point forward involved conversations about our progress as well as strategizing our next steps. Dr. Reichman's feedback and intuition helped us to make difficult decisions about the genetic testing of embryos, fresh versus frozen transfers, and whether to commit to additional cycles to increases our odds. 

Dr. Reichman's professionalism is unparalleled. He is quick to address inquiries via email and he makes sure his nurses have everything they need to fully support patients. Thankfully, while skilled, experienced and confident, he is never arrogant or smug, and he doesn't hesitate to consult colleagues for additional opinions. For example, my sonogram once revealed something that caused Dr. Reichman to question the need for a medical procedure that would have delayed our cycle (but if necessary, we wouldn't have hesitated to do). After reviewing past cases and seeking counsel from a trusted colleague, he decided to forego the procedure and proceed as planned. We greatly appreciated the time he took to truly consider all the factors and arrive at a decision we all trusted as the right one. 

Through it all, Dr. Reichman was honest, pensive, warm, empathetic and supportive. And he even managed to infuse a bit of humor into things at just the right moments. IVF is an emotionally and physically trying process. Being in Dr. Reichman's care made the difficult times more bearable and the good times even sweeter. We are currently pregnant and are forever grateful to Dr. Reichman and his stellar team for their strong work and endless support.

Be prepared for candor, and know that it is in the name of earning your trust. He deeply cares and he is committed to helping you achieve your dream of becoming a parent. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">From the beginning, it was clear that Dr. Reichman was invested in us as a couple and would do everything in his power to help us grow our family. He was always honest, warm and empathetic.  We found comfort in his words, even those that were difficult to hear, and we viewed him as our third teammate in our fertility journey.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">We did three rounds of IVF. Admittedly, the details are a bit foggy, but each round involved injections of Gonal-G, menopur and cetrotide.  Our doses changed according to the results of my bloodwork and the number and size of developing follicles revealed in sonograms. I distinctly remember delaying the start of a cycle based on a sonogram following my most recent period. Dr. Reichman didn't feel the timing was right and chose to push to the next month, which ended up being a much better month follicle-wise. Each round is a learning experience and our results improved every cycle. 

Our first frozen embryo transfer did not take. For our second transfer, Dr. Reichman decided to do a ""programmed transfer"" where we would manipulate my hormones. While my progesterone levels had historically been fine, he chose to prescribe nightly progesterone shots five days before the transfer, 10 days following the transfer (until the results of the pregnancy test), and since we are pregnant, through the first trimester. This was done as a precautionary measure to support the lining of the uterus (until the placenta takes over and produces its own hormones). Additionally, I have worn estrogen patches throughout this time since my estrogen has been consistently low. As my estrogen has increased, the number of patches has decreased in the last week.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">We had extremely positive experiences with the Weill Cornell Tribeca nursing staff and we can't see enough about the quality of our nurse, Christine Lu. She is extremely organized, reliable, communicative and compassionate. We looked forward to hearing from her, appreciated her thorough instructions, and always knew she had our best interest in mind. Christine was aware of the fact that we did not have our insurance was not covering our IVF treatment. As a result, she worked with us to organize our pharmacy visits and purchases to keep our costs down and avoid waste. 

We truly appreciated Christine and were so grateful for her responsive, support and endless care.

You might have to make these early morning commitments on a few weekends and quite a bit on weekdays. Prepare your partner to be involved in it too.

He is direct and says things as they are, which is also my style so it was greatly appreciated.

We did 2 back to back retrievals to make sure we have enough embryos, always using ICSI and microfluidics. 1st retrieval - 4 eggs, 3 mature, 3 fertilized, 2 made it to Day 5 and came back PGD normal. 2nd retrieval - 5 eggs, 5 mature, 5 fertilized, 4 made it do Day 5 and PGD normal. Then we did 3 back to back single embryo transfers. 1st natural FET - negative, 2nd natural FET - chemical, 3rd programmed FET - chemical. Dr. Reichman was surprised we didn’t have successful pregnancy yet, so he completely switched the approach. We did another IVF (10 eggs, 10 mature, 9 fertilized) and did a fresh transfer of 2 8-cell embryos on Day 3. It was a negative again, so he did a hysteroscopy to rule out uterine factor. We then proceeded to another IVF, this time using testicular sperm to circumvent the male factor. We had 7 eggs, 5 mature, 3 fertilized, 2 made it to day 3, we did a fresh transfer of 2 embryos (8-cell and 6-cell) on Day 3, which ultimately succeeded.

Retrieval is ~$10, hospital fee/anesthesia ~1K, PGD testing ~$4K-6K (depending on #of embryos), frozen transfer ~$4K. IVF with fresh transfer was around $14K all in, TESE and hysteroscopy were fully covered by insurance so can’t remember the price tag. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">In general, Dr. Reichman has preference for a single embryo transfer especially when embryos were tested.

So when we tried for another child it was surprising and shocking when we were not able to, each miscarriage was extremely difficult for us.  From the first meeting with Dr. Reichman, he laid out a path for us to figure out what was going on. Long story short-I was diagnosed with ""secondary infertility"" due to scar tissue in my uterus from a D&amp;C procedure (after 1st miscarriage in 2017) and a condition called Asherman's syndrome (as a result of the D&amp;C).  Dr. Reichman performed a hysteroscopy to remove the scar tissue successfully and guided us throughout the IVF procedure.  He is a phenomenal doctor, smart and precise.  I felt very safe and trusted him 100% with good reason - he is great.  We decided to do ICSI with PGT due to me being a carrier for Fabry's disease and later frozen embryo transplant using 5 day old embryo.  Because of his careful guidance and treatment we were able to successfully get pregnant after the very 1st transfer (which we did in early March 2019). Our family is blessed and we are so thankful and forever grateful to Dr. Reichman and the entire staff at Weill Cornell CRM - as just few short weeks ago we welcomed a healthy baby boy into our family.

His confidence gave me strength.  He is extremely knowledgeable in his field of medicine.  He is prompt and thorough, yet he takes his time to make sure that you understand every aspect of the situation.  He is friendly and caring.  Excellent bedside manner.  Gentle during procedures.  One of the best medical professionals I have ever dealt with.  I trust him with my health 100% and would recommend anyone I care about to him.  He is absolutely amazing.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Trust him.  If he says there is a chance for a successful pregnancy then follow his lead.  I was at the point where I had no hope.   I went to the consultation because my husband really wanted to go.  After a few miscarriages, I didn't think anything would work.  Dr. Reichman didn't sell me a dream or make promises in any way.  He told us our options and made us think about it.  We chose to move forward and from day one Dr. Reichman guided me through each step.  Everything he said or expected to happen, happened.  I'm not saying that every patient will have a success story, but he knows what he is doing.  I can't imagine him leading a patient on.  He is upfront but gentle when discussing your medical condition.  It took me a little while to have confidence in him, but once he gained my confidence I knew I was in the right hands. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The physician is compassionate, empathetic, yet confident.  He takes his time with you and explains every detail step by step.  He makes it a point to know his patients and reach the best solution to each situation with them.  He guided my husband and I regarding insurance coverage and what would be the best option for us not to get overwhelmed with financial responsibility.  It's not about the money for him </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">In my case, my eggs were poor quality.  Which Dr. Reichman mentioned, could be a possibility, during our first consult with him.  He recommended Genetic Testing.  We knew I could conceive but we couldn't control which egg was being fertilized.  By having the eggs Genetically tested, we were able to transfer the healthiest egg.  So I took injections for a few weeks, went for the egg retrieval, waited for the lab tests, had the genetic testing done, and finally had the egg transfer.  I am now almost 2mo pregnant and all is going well.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The nursing staff are amazing.  The whole team is organized and professional.  They are friendly and take their time with you.  They smile when they greet you.  They actually seem like they love their jobs.  Nobody has ever been rude, unfriendly, or unkind.  They promptly return calls and walk through each step to take next.  They make sure they consult with the physician and know every necessary detail before they contact you.  Each conversation or given direction was executed professionally and accurately.  They're knowledge and dedication make every experience and visit run very smooth.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The clinic is very clean.  It is a warm environment.  Patient information is all kept private.  The fact that the team is so organized, helps with waiting times.  You will not sit in the waiting room for 1hr wondering if anyone forgot about you.  They are on point.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Monitoring appts, as well as most other appts. are all done first thing in the morning.  Monitoring is very frequent.  It is very convenient for the working woman.  You can get all your monitoring done and report to work without a problem. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">With Dr. Reichman's suggestion, I upgraded my insurance to a plan that covered 90% of the infertility treatment.  Everything done in the office was covered.  Majority of medication and medical supplies were covered. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">In Dr. Reichman's opinion, I didn't need multiple embryo transfer.  I'm glad he chose the approach that he did.  It was perfect for my individual situation.  May not work for every patient but it worked for me and that's all that matters. </div>]"

His manner is friendly but professional, and he is even-keeled and confident in his expertise. His interactions are straightforward and matter-of-fact with enugh warmth and compassion for the experience. I've always felt quite comfortable wit Dr. Reichman. 
However, morning monitoring hours are not the best time to ask Dr. Reichman detailed questions. He will answer them albeit slightly more brusquely than when you meet with him for a consultation or other appointments. He's very responsive over email. He is, I would say, mostly focused on the fertility treatment as a direct option; he is less concerned with or focused on addressing underlying issues of infertility. He is mission-driven and mission-focused. If you want a more holistic approach (that takes your body's fertility and health into more detailed consideration), Dr. Reichman may not be your first choice. He may be taking these factors into careful consideration, but that wasn't necessarily clearly communicated during my IUI and IVF processes. Overall, I've always trusted his advice, and he has always encouraged me to ask any questions or share any concerns.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Clearly communicate any and all concerns/questions you may have, even if they may seem minor or even if Dr. Reichman does not bring them up.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Monitoring hours are difficult for everyone involved. I'm not sure if anything can be done about these procedures (whether the lab can push back their hours), but it's early in the morning, there's a packed waiting room full of women being called in large batches; it feels like a cattle call. Dr. Reichman is slightly more brusque and rushed during monitoring hours (understandably so). He is patient enough to answer all questions, but there's a lot of pressure and urgency to get undressed, dressed, and ask questions efficiently and succinctly.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">During IVF, Dr. Reichman ordered a protocol of almost-daily monitoring (usually ultrasound and bloodwork). He was erring on the side of caution, which was a comfort, as I was at risk for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). He prescribed low dosages of Gonal-F and Menopur, increased dosage, then lowered dosage by 10-15 units according to my bloodwork each day. I injected the trigger shot on day 14. Fourteen eggs were retrieved two days later. Five embryos were cryopreserved, one was a fresh transfer on day 5. The embryo successfully implanted. 
He was very careful with my dosages to avoid OHSS and clearly explained the risks and possibilities. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">My primary nurse is great overall. Most of the nursing staff at Weill-Cornell Tribeca are great; most were friendly, professional, and very kind. One nurse (name is slipping my mind) who regularly drew my blood was very kind in particular. 
I rarely saw my primary nurse and care coordinators in person, but they were available to me by phone. They are not responsive via email, phone is best.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Feels like a cattle call some mornings, most mornings are very efficient and painless, overall staff is great--professional, friendly, efficient.
You'll find the people you want to deal with on a regular basis.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Mostly efficient and convenient to my schedule (6:45-8:30 am). There were a few (mostly rare) occasions when it felt like a cattle call, long-ish wait, then rushed.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Had to pay out of pocket for all IUI treatments. There was a discount for same-day payments.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Yes, Dr. Reichman strongly recommended a transfer of a single embryo and explained the risks of multiple embryo transfer to my health and the embryo's chances of survival. I completely trusted his judgment and rationale. I appreciated that he is mission-driven and practices extreme caution. He wants to be able to deliver a healthy (as safe as possible) pregnancy, not a risky one.</div>]"

Not only did Dr. P reinstate our hope in ever having children, but he thought that we should give an IUI a chance because our original diagnosis of poor morphology was potentially not as bad as initially thought.  Dr. P’s instinct was spot on because our very first IUI with him worked!  Aside from our miracle we felt confident that he is a doctor who would always know what to do next when unexpected outcomes come up, and his incredible knowledge and confidence was obvious.  Not to mention, he is an all-around awesome guy (and funny too)!  We will definitely be back to him (if we need) for baby number 2 and HIGHLY recommend him to anyone struggling with incompetent doctors and a complex fertility case.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. P wanted to observe my eggs naturally for one cycle to see how large the follicle gets to better help us time the trigger for IVF.

We did a bit of research on Fertility IQ before choosing a clinic &amp; doctor and were not disappointed by our choice.  Knowing time is extremely important we didn't want to waste time in not-a-great-experience.  We wanted a doctor with a solid reputation and results.  Right from the first consultation we were pleased by the amount of time Dr. Choi spent with us, including detailed explanations of all required testing, fertility treatment options including risk factors and percentage chance of success, and any limitations.  Again we had done a bit of research on infertility before any appointments so we were able to jump right into conversation with her.  She heard our concerns and addressed them.  She was very factual and speaks quickly, so we always needed to be paying close attention.  I brought my notes from home and my recent cycle dates on paper and she appreciated it.  
Two times, after testing results were received, we would send detailed questions/concerns into the Facility's nurses inbox and Dr. Choi called directly in reply.  She allayed concerns, not with any pretense of guaranteed results, but reminding us there was likely not any one factor that would determine full success or full failure.  We appreciated the personal touch. 
Dr Choi's protocol selection for me was spot on.  The research we did on our own shows it was slightly aggressive but had it not been we would have not likely gotten the same results.  The egg retrieval experience was good as well. She also always called with results (with any thing more than normal monitoring instructions).   Dr Choi and her staff also worked with us patiently as we changed our minds a couple times regarding how we wanted the IVF cycle to proceed (fresh vs frozen transfer; PGS testing or not).  She said, ""I'll do what you guys want to do,"" so it made us feel heard.  Ultimately we went with her recommendation; and we feel we got the best results we could have.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Do your own research and homework outside of your treatment recommendations, more for your own understanding.

She remembered our situation, concerns, and addressed them in subsequent appointments.  She also went out of her way to say a quick hello even if we were only in office for blood work or monitoring.  It made us feel like we were ""her patients."" </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I was diagnosed with a slightly lower egg supply (diminished ovarian reserve), with high FSH.  My AMH is considered normal/age appropriate... somewhat of a conundrum.  So designing a treatment protocol that would wake up enough eggs but not make me overstimulate was important.  
The protocal included...
Estrogen priming, Menopur, Follistim, later added in Ganirellix, and 2 trigger shots.  I didn't overstimulate and was pleased with the number of eggs retrieved. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr Choi's primary Nurse, Emily, was very competent as well.  Once we were working with her during the IVF cycle, we felt much more assure we were in good hands.  She was always organized when we saw her and was always quick to reply thru the patient portal.
We did have have some back and forth discrepancies with the patient care coordinator and the financial coordinator during the testing working up and before moving forward with the pricing/decided treatment.  Sometimes we felt things got tacked on that we didn't ask for.  I can imagine some people pay for services that aren't needed.  We really had to advocate for ourselves that what were getting and paying for only what we wanted.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">CCRM's strengths are its Doctors, Embryologists, and technologies.  The money goes primarily to these areas.  The business office &amp; team could be organized a little better (8 of 10).

Each thing got worked out, but it took a couple emails/phone calls.  Once we were fully in the IVF cycle, the injection protocol, monitoring, egg retrieval, and follow up all went smoothly.  This is when we really became a ""fan"" of CCRM.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The IVF cycle costed around $16K.  This does not include the initial consultation

It's nice to have someone ask questions about ME and not just about my fertility issues.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Our first two protocols were letrozole + Ovidrel trigger followed by specifically timed intercourse. With diminished ovarian reserve due to age, this rationale was to get the best egg response and time my cycle. We also added luteal support with progesterone inserts and estrogen patches. Unfortunately, we didn't conceive. Dr Levine then suggested trying an IUI which would increase our chances slightly, but get the sperm at least closer to the egg -- if that was the conception issue. We did the same medication protocol with letrozole (great response from my body), ovidrel trigger followed by a specifically timed IUI. We used a fresh sperm sample the day of the IUI with no male factor issues. Unfortunately, this didn't lead to conception either. Dr Levine has no adjusted course which my husband and I really appreciate. He didn't push us one way or the other actually -- he simply informed us of our options. We decided to skip another IUI and move into IVF due to my age, ovarian response and success rates with IVF. We started with a month of estrogen priming followed by a cycle of menopur + cetrotide + clomid + dexamethasone + gonal f + and will trigger with lupron + novarel when the time comes for retrieval. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The nursing staff is fantastic. They greet you in the lobby with a smile and genuine concern for how you are. The women you take your blood are fast. Trust me, from someone who faints, they are quick, kind and in and out! The nurses for the ultrasound are smart and efficient. The IVF nurses are also kind and answer all questions efficiently. I will urge you to stay on top of your own medical care. As wonderful as the nurses and providers are, things can get missed. Be proactive about asking questions when you either don't understand or think they gave you conflicting information. I had to inform them several times about a medication allergy which was fine; there are a lot of nurses and they share your medical information between them. I have learned to be patient while one nurse might not be up to speed.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The clinic's strengths are many. The front receptionists and administrators are fantastic. They always pick up the phone, rarely put you on hold and get back to you with the information you require. They are fast to book your appointments and share details on schedules. Very accommodating. As I mentioned, the nursing staff for bloods and ultrasound are fantastic. The facility is clean and modern. Instruments and rooms are clean and up to date. Sanitization is on point. Communicating through their encrypted portal via email is great for lab results, emails, questions, general billing questions. 

I would say be proactive about your health. Since at the end of the day, you've spent time, finances and emotion on this journey. Own it and communicate with the clinic often. Things can get missed due to patient volume and the time to catch up on a patient's background. The longest response times were from billing, consent forms and insurance pre-certification departments. They eventually assisted, but it was difficult to connect with them. The IVF nurses were great, but I definitely needed to stay on top of things. If something was amiss or instructions were conflicting, it would initially drive me crazy! Now, I'm much more in control and don't rely on them to reach out first. I would recommend the patient call or email them proactively. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I would recommend you ask for the billing costs. They sent a complete list of all procedures, codes for insurance if you have it, and the costs associated with each item. Costs for timed intercourse cycles were low -- medications were under $5. Trigger shots were closer to $200. IUI procedures were around $1K. And IVF is around $23K including PGS testing, biopsy, ICSI and assisted hatching. Medications we shopped around for the best prices at local and other pharmacies.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">We haven't gotten to the FET stage as of yet, but I believe the clinic prefers FET over fresh embryo transfers. I also believe that eSET is the preferred method, but would suggest you chat with Dr Levine about your questions and concerns.</div>]"

The positives.  She will respond to your emails/calls and you will actually see her and get to know her as your doctor.  She absolutely knew us as people and as patients.  She is approachable, intelligent and was quick to admit when our case went beyond her comfort zone at which point she referred us out to a consulting specialist.  

The downsides:  She felt very rushed, careless and not as thorough as we would have liked. She contradicted herself on multiple occasions.  On one occasion, she performed the wrong kind of sonogram on me.  The nail in the coffin was the fact that she failed to make note of the medications that the specialist (who she referred me to) prescribed.  As a result, she prescribed me two medications that I was already taking.  

When our case became complicated, she justified proposed treatments with anecdotal stories instead of studies. This made us feel like she wasn't willing to dig deep for answers and was instead relying on whatever evidence jumped to mind.  

Ironically, we felt that she was at her best when she called to give us bad news (failed IUIs, IVF cycles and chemical pregnancies).  At these moments, she slowed down and provided us with thoughtful unhurried responses to our questions.  

We did not get pregnant with Dr. Knopman and I don't know if that is the result of her care.  If I'm honest with myself, I don't necessarily think it is.  What I do know is that in the end neither my husband nor I had confidence in her attention to detail and the stakes were too high to risk having a detail fall through the cracks.  We've since moved to another clinic and feel much more confident that we are getting the level of attention we should be.  Even if we don't ultimately get the outcome we want, we feel better about the process than we did with Dr. Knopman.   </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Be prepared to speak up and advocate for yourself.  I think Dr Knopman genuinely wants the best for all of her patients, but I suspect she is just super busy.  Don't be the patient who gets shortchanged and demand the time/answers you need.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr Knopman gave the impression she really cared about you.  She knew my name and was extremely friendly, but in the end we felt like in the ways that mattered most she wasn't paying attention.  On one occasion, I came in for a saline sonogram and she performed a standard transvaginal ultrasound.  On multiple occasions, she provided one response to a question only to provide a different one later (e.g. - do supplements have an impact on sperm quality?)</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The women who do morning monitoring (particularly blood draws) are truly the best part of this clinic.  They are so kind and compassionate.  I genuinely looked forward to seeing them.  With rare exception, the doctor's nurses were also wonderful and very friendly.  Occasionally prescriptions did not get called in, but they seemed pretty on top of it.  I've heard horror stories of nurses at other clinics and you won't get any of that here.  You might like one more than another, but they are all caring, component and pleasant.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The clinic is beautiful and monitoring is a breeze. Almost everyone there will know your name.  This makes the process of going through IVF so much more pleasant.  That said, we came here based on the stellar reputation of CCRM and we quickly realized we were at CCRM New York, not CCRM Colorado.  It became clear after having a consult with Dr. Schoolcraft at CCRM Colorado that they are doing things differently there.  For one, while CCRM NY offers acupuncture, they never once mentioned the benefits of complementary therapy (supplements, acupuncture, etc.)  and even seemed to poo poo it.  They market themselves as a super personal and they are in the sense they know you, but medically speaking it feels a little bit like a factory.  I don't think I got any more of a personalized approach there than I would have at any other major NY clinic.   </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">We spent approximately 50,000 on 2 egg retrievals and 3 transfers at CCRM excluding meds.  </div>]"

Since I have been through several cycles (at another clinic) I knew what to expect at the steps along the way. I found myself asking the nurses and coordinator for information that they should have been telling me. I was giving them personal information twice because they said they didn't have it (but I had given to someone else) One visit they thought I was only getting blood, no sonogram and only knew I needed the sonogram because I said something. Even after discussing it they thought I was on a different day of stims. All instructions are emailed through their portal which is very nice to not be on edge waiting for a phone and thinking you might miss it. It is easy to print the email and then have a checklist of meds until your next visit. The only set back is if when you don't get a message. Once I called because it was 4:30 and I still hadn't gotten my instructions. The nurse said she already sent it and I just didn't receive. So you still have to be on top of that.
Although their are a few setbacks overall the staff is very friendly and willing to help.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Morning monitoring are scheduled appointments and are usually called within 5-10 mins of appointment time. If you want to see your doctor for monitoring you have to tell them when making the appointment. If not, you just see the doctor covering AM monitoring. 
If you know you are going for blood and ultrasound and a nurse tells you differently question it. They could have inaccurate information. Although the clinic is on the smaller side, confusion can still happen! </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">CCRM was very detailed with billing.

She does not hand hold. It is incumbent upon the patient to do their research, she does not go into detail about certain plans and treatments, but does offer those plans as suggestions. I think one of the hardest parts of going through IVF is the education that grows deeper at every stage and the understanding that it's not up to your doctor to give you that education. Your doctor is part of your support system but they aren't your only support system. Their role is clearly defined and Dr. Knopman stays within those boundaries. She is compassionate and accessible when necessary. She doesn't respond to every email, but not every email is always necessary for her to respond to. She includes nurses and other staff when questions are better suited for those individuals. She is not warm and fuzzy but she is kind.

Because it was our first time seeing a RE, he started with a very thorough diagnosis procedure and recommended that we attempt IUI first, explaining to us the success rate of this procedure compared to the slightly more invasive IVF procedure. After a few IUI attempts that were not working for us, he recommended that we move on to IVF, which we did, ultimately achieving success on our first embryo transfer. 

Dr. Levine’s approach to our case was personalized and data-driven. He cited up to date studies pertaining to the procedures we were involved in and was very thorough and knowledgeable in answering all the questions I had about the whole process. As an academic myself, this was very important to me, as I knew I didn’t have time to read all the relevant scientific literature on the protocols and procedures we were about to experience.

Dr. Levine performed my egg retrieval procedure, which was flawless. I experienced minimal side effects and there were much more eggs retrieved than I anticipated. The pre-op and post-op communication was amazing.

Dr. Levine is very well connected and has amazing contacts in the NYC area. As I developed thyroid issues early in my pregnancy he recommended a great list of endocrinologists that I could choose from, based on my health insurance coverage and preference. He also recommended a long list of great OBGYNs at graduation and made sure I checked out to an OBGYN he trusted upon graduation.

The plan was for him to produce eggs that I would carry. As soon as we sat down with the Doc we knew we were in the right spot.  She never lied or filled our hearts with false hopes, but she did make it clear that she wasn't willing to give up until we were holding our baby.  As many who have traveled this road know it is not easy, it's an emotional rollercoaster and very personal.  It is the most vulnerable who will ever feel.  You sit there and discuss yourself in full detail and can't help but feel like you're a failure because you can't do what ""normal"" people do.  The Doc never made us feel like failures, not even when outcomes beyond anyone's control weren't what we hoped or planned for.  When it turned out that my husband just could not produce eggs that were viable the Doc shared in our tears, but never let us feel like that was the end.  We discussed new options and directions at length and she was always willing to listen to all of our ideas no matter how crazy they were.  She made herself available at all hours so that we could do conference calls, she even stepped out of a dinner party one time to call us because that was most convenient for us.  She never left us in the dark and we never felt alone.  She made us feel comfortable with every step, test and procedure. She was so dedicated to us that even after being dragged on the ground by a taxi, the morning of my retrieval, she got her head stitched up and walked into the room ready to make a baby for us.

This just would not have been possible if it weren't for Dr Talebian or ""Doc"" as we like to call her.  Both the Doc and the staff became like family.

This experience had been totally inhuman, awful, and ineffective. 

I remember crying after my first appointment with Dr. Levine, because he treated me so warmly and compassionately from the moment I stepped into his office. I remember he spent a full hour with me discussing not only my case history, but who I was a person, what I liked to do during my free time, how I had been feeling about my fertility issues, etc. He didn't rush me, and he repeatedly allowed there to be pauses so I could ask more questions. 

Dr. Levine and his team wrote everything down for me, always. I know this seems so simple, but I can't tell you how reassuring it was to have a plan and to have that plan documented in writing. Dr. Levine gave me his personal e-mail, and he ALWAYS responded or called me back, even when I e-mailed late at night. I remember receiving a call from him at 8pm, 2 minutes after I had e-mailed, when he was clearly in the middle of a family dinner.

She's extremely knowledgeable, kind, and accessible. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Go for it!</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">When I first called CCRM in New York, the very pleasant receptionist, Stephanie, made an appointment for me to talk by phone with Dr. Talebian. When we spoke, Dr. Talebian was straight forward and suggested I move on to IVF after three failed IUIs due to my age and my lack of positive pregnancy tests. I explained that I lived on the west coast, was considering spending a few months in New York, and I was open to doing IVF during my stay, but wanted to think a bit more. She gave me her direct email address and told me to reach out with any questions. Our phone call was about 20 minutes long and I was left feeling like I had a straightforward plan for next steps with a kind, clear doctor. I was also impressed that she praised my local clinic and doctor where I had IUIs. When we decided to come to New York, I sent CCRM NY an email to tell them I wanted to establish myself with their clinic and was surprised when a couple of days later, Dr. Talebian called me directly to talk about next steps. Since we've met in person, I've sent her a couple of emails and she's gotten back to me within a couple of hours at most. I'm sure she gets the same questions all the time, but she's been incredibly patient with us and answers questions with clarity.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I'm just starting my first IVF cycle. Dr. Talebian has me on an estrogen patch for about a week before my first suppression ultrasound and blood work. Then, I'll start on 300 units of Gonal-F and 2 vials of Menopur along with an oral steroid. My husband will start a round of antibiotics when I begin my injections. Depending on how the stimulation goes, I'll start the Centrotide and eventually do an HCG trigger shot and Lupron.
They told me that after the embryo transfer (hopefully we will get some!), I'll be doing progesterone shots. She also said that a daily baby aspirin would be something advisable after an embryo transfer.
As far as the fertilization, she told us we could do a mix of ICSI and PICSI. This helps give potentially damaged sperm the best shot at making a good embryo.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The nurses as CCRM have been pleasant and prompt. They helped me track down medication, figured out billing, and let us use extra testing syringes to test what it feels like to give a shot. The only flub happened during our first appointment when they had both of our names wrong. The last thing you want at a fertility clinic is to get someone else's name on your paperwork or sample!</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The clinic is beautiful, clean, and spa-like. The waiting room has never been packed, but I have seen many couples waiting in the blood draw area. The receptionists are great.

Dr. Levine is extremely approachable, warm, professional and compassionate.

You are a person and not a patient. The wait in the morning for monitoring is negligible compared to other clinics but more importantly, they are warm, professional, approachable and accommodating.

My only constructive feedback for him would be about managing expectations. I was told upfront that my outlook was very good, and 8 months later am still not pregnant. As long as you manage your own expectations, you are in the best hands. Keeping my fingers crossed for the rest of my journey! </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Manage your own expectations and be prepared with questions.

We were lucky enough to have gone to him straight away after recommendations from friends, and avoided the horror stories of ""feeling like a number"" at other clinics. 

He immediately establishes a rapport, can relate to you personally, and makes you feel like you are the only patient that matters during that time. He thoroughly answers all of my questions - day or night, in person, phone or email - and encourages me to ask them. I'm especially impressed with how promptly he returns my emails.

While I have still not gotten pregnant and am actually seeking a second opinion due to my unexplained diagnosis (just curious what a fresh perspective might uncover!), I feel super confident and comfortable with Dr. Levine. Just trying to be patient :) </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Letrozole and Ovidrel injection; second cycle = Letrozole and Ovidrel injection before IUI, Progesterone suppositories and Estrogen patch post-IUI; third cycle = Clomid and Ovidrel injection before IUI, Progesterone suppositories and Estrogen patch post-IUI (resulted in chemical pregnancy); fourth cycle = same as third - Clomid and Ovidrel injection before IUI, Progesterone suppositories and Estrogen patch post-IUI.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The nursing staff at CCRM is top notch.

They are super flexible on timing and only once have I ever experienced a longer wait time. 

Con: It is expensive. Like, really expensive. I am very fortunate to be able to come here but most people cannot afford this level of care. Hopefully in my case it will be worth it but at least CCRM has assured me total peace of mind throughout this entire process. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Each visit is $250, with ultrasounds billed at $295. It is not covered by insurance, although they will submit it for you and it should count towards your deductible and out-of-pocket/out-of-network maximum. 

Blood work is a $25 copay with additional lab billing that's usually (for me) around $10.

On our first visit, he discussed many different protocols and the types of patients who are successful in each.  He is very well versed on the fertility literature and studies and as such, he is able to offer both the most successful protocols and able to tweak them slightly to improve our success.   He never ordered frivolous and expensive tests.  Every question I posed to him was answered with science backed evidence.  He explained the rational for every step of the embryo transfer.  His optimism helped me believe we were going to have a baby.  When I was having serious doubts about continuing what I thought was sure to be an unsuccessful cycle, he encouraged me to continue the cycle, and it ended up being our most successful one.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Ask lots of questions.  He'll have the answers and it will put your mind at ease.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Levine always made me feel like he genuinely cared about me and the success of my fertility treatment.  He came in on his day off to do my egg retrieval because he recognized I was nervous about it.  He often came in on Saturdays to monitor his patients.  He was incredibly thoughtful to ask about my life outside of fertility treatments and then remember those conversations at later appointments. Throughout my entire treatment Dr. Levine treated both my infertility and the emotional toll it took on me.  When I asked him at our initial consult how I could better manage the stress of this process, he offered solutions and talked through different coping mechanisms. He allowed my husband to stay the room (which didn't feel like a sterile hospital exam room) with me during the embryo transfer.  It was really comforting to have my husband there and allowed my husband to feel part of the process.  Lastly, he always made time for me if I had a question.  He is very responsive on email.

While I initial objected to the injection, he showed me studies indicating the progesterone injection produced more live births.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I felt like everyone at CCRM knew me and were rooting for me.  All of the CCRM nurses are very well versed in fertility treatments.  If I had questions, they always knew the answers (or would go find them out -- even speaking to the embryologists to get accurate answers).  They were able to explain why I needed some medications over others.  They answered all phone calls by the end of business day.  When I needed to pick medications up at other pharmacies, the nurses were expeditious in calling in the medications.  The OR nurses were very empathetic -- my egg retrieval was on a cold January Monday and the nurses warmed up the bed for me so I wouldn't feel cold.  The front desk staff is very warm and friendly.   They knew my name and were very friendly both in the office and on phone calls.  They were very helpful in making appointments that worked with my schedule.  Lastly, the phlebotomists, especially Lori, were wonderful.  She always asked me how I was feeling and I felt like she was my biggest cheerleader for me at every appointment. 
</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The CCRM staff is exceptional; everyone (including all of the doctors) knew my name and my case.  Every doctor there is warm and incredibly smart – I felt lucky knowing these people were caring for me.  CCRM does not feel like a medical clinic.  The waiting room has couches and music; the exam rooms (especially the embryo transfer room) doesn’t feel sterile.  I initially didn’t think making a monitoring appointment would be important.  But having waited for over an hour at other clinics for my monitoring, I now appreciate how nice it is that I never waited at CCRM.  They have lots of appointments and could always fit me in.   I also appreciate that they don’t over monitor you so you could try to live a normal life during this process. The only weakness is that CCRM is expensive compared to other clinics.  But for me, they were also the most successful. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">CCRM does not take insurance and is expensive compared to other clinics.  But we paid for 1 expensive but successful cycle at CCRM and paid for 4 less expensive but unsuccessful cycles elsewhere.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Levine’s goal is for each person to have a baby in the healthiest way possible.  As such, we implanted one embryo.  He had no reason to believe in our case that implanting 2 embryos would increase our odds of having one baby and furthermore could produce twins, which is higher risk for the mother and babies.  I was very nervous that our embryo was a grade 3.  He provided comfort to me by explaining how embryos of this grade aren’t as traumatized during embryo transfer and often implant better.  As I noted before, during the actual embryo transfer Dr. Levine explained his rational for the exact location of where he placed the embryo in the uterus.  This gave me a lot of comfort in knowing that everything he does has a specific purpose.</div>]"

In fact, he called me over the weekend from his cell phone to talk about the importance of listening to your body, and that taking a break in treatment was totally normal.

My wife and I are in our mid-late 30s and had been trying for our first child naturally for 8 months.  Naturally, my wife and I were getting anxious and dreaded each period, which when it came, we were back to the drawing board.  They didn't tell us having a baby was supposed to be this hard.  We did some research and found Dr. Levine at CCRM.  We learned that CCRM was a famous clinic from Colorado and people would fly there from all over the world.  Dr. Levine had just opened a branch in NYC after training at all the best places (e.g., Cornell and NYU).  We had an initial consultation with Dr. Levine that lasted about an hour and a half.  We were very impressed with his facility – it was private, it was calming and everyone we encountered was so sweet.  I was pleasantly surprised how much time the Dr.  took with us.  Dr. Levine had all the tests available to him and explained to us that all the traditional metrics suggested both my wife and I should have no problems conceiving - but yet we were having problems. Dr. Levine took the time to get to know us and my wife both on a medical level and a personal level – what is my wife’s medical history, but also, what drives us, what do we like to do for fun, etc...  We thought we were visiting with a friend.  My wife went into the meeting pushing for IUI of IVF - she was tired of waiting and wanted to get pregnant ASAP.  I was not as alarmed, but I was worried that given my wife's state, that the Dr. would proceed with the more expensive approaches without exhausting less invasive avenues.  Our experience with Dr. Levine was quite the opposite - he took time with us and was focused on less invasive approaches before turning to IUI, IVF and other treatments. 

Through our initial casual meeting Dr. Levine was able to deduce that my wife tended to have a lot of mucus in her sinuses and, moreover that it was thick. Dr. Levine explained that sometimes thick mucus could prevent the sperm from reaching the eggs - I guess sperm can't swim through thick mucus - who knew?  Dr. Levine suggested that that my wife take standard over the counter Mucinex once a day for a week during ovulation as a first step.  Guess what - we were pregnant within a week!  A true miracle.  Dr. Levine guided us through the first 8 weeks of my wife's pregnancy which was such a comforting experience.  We saw Dr. Levine once a week for 8 weeks and each week we learned more about the development of our baby, what to expect and all the time, knowing that we were in the best hands.  Dr. Levine continued to reach out to us through the entire pregnancy, even when my wife's care was turned over to her OBGYN.  And thank goodness he stayed in touch with us.

At 37 weeks pregnant, we got some of the worst news a family can get - my wife was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer.  Things were sort of a blur for a while, but we had to have the baby as soon as possible so that my wife could undergo scans and treatment.  Luckily my son was full term because my wife had to be induced within a few days after diagnosis.  We now have a beautiful healthy baby boy who is the light of our lives and, while all sorts of people played a role, much of the credit goes to Dr. Levine.  My wife had to commence treatment right after our son was born.  The treatment raises all sorts of questions related to future fertility - did we want to have more children?  Is there time to harvest eggs?  Could my wife even carry another child?  What are the risks?  The questions and the decisions were overwhelming.  At times they still are.  But Dr. Levine has been with us the whole way.  Advising us at every step - what are our options, how can we maximize our options while not compromising my wife's health?   And he does this over the phone, via text message, during the weekend - basically whenever we need it.  He is compassionate, extremely knowledgeable and proactive - he knows the difficulty were/are going through and he rises to the occasion.  He was in constant communication with my wife's OBGYN.  Quite frankly, Dr. Levine went above and beyond - and he does this as his standard practice. 
During these last several months, my wife and I have engaged the medical system more than we ever thought we would and we are constantly moved by the quality of people that provide care.  Dr. Levine is in the absolute top of this class, and I would recommend him and his practice to anyone any time.

From the moment you walk in the door and greet the receptionist, to the nurses drawing blood, to Dr. Levine you are treated like a person deserving of respect and time.

We saw a heartbeat at 6 and 7 weeks, but during the 8 week ultrasound there was no heartbeat. I also had a SCH during the pregnancy, but ultimately the cause of m/c was undetermined. Repeat loss panel was performed. Only thing that came up was that I was homozygous for MTHFR. I changed my diet and used Lovenox with next natural FET. A 7-day 6BB was transferred.

Dr. Levine was optimistic and confident from the beginning that he could get us pregnant. And he was right!</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I knew from a prior physician that I had diminished ovarian reserve (DOR). Brian correctly identified that I also had a luteal phase defect in that after I ovulated, the second half of my cycle was very short - on average only 8-10 days. This wasn't long enough for an embryo to implant even if my egg was getting fertilized. I had been treated with Clomid (despite a thin lining) and estrogen pills by my previous fertility specialist. He switched me to Letrozole (doesn't thin your lining), estrogen patches (works better than the pills), and progesterone suppositories which helped to lengthen my luteal phase. I truly think that was the key and if we had done that sooner we wouldn't have had so many failed cycles before finding the right combination of meds that finally helped us to get pregnant.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Liz was always very responsive to emails and helped coordinate sending prescriptions to different pharmacies depending on where my husband or I were that was convenient for us. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The office is gorgeous.

My husband also really enjoyed the coffee and snacks in the waiting room :) The staff was very well coordinated and very efficient. Each visit I had an ultrasound and blood draws and they always happened consecutively.

I think this plan worked well for us because we got a diagnosis and started the treatment process with the treatment being covered by insurance. We quickly switched to Dr. Levine after the initial testing and I am so glad that we did. He is worth every penny.

But, one other thing to note - I'm currently 7 weeks pregnant with a chromosomally perfect soon-to-be son.  That's entirely because of Dr. Levine's abilities as a doctor - he took us from no viable embryos to a pregnancy in less than 6 months.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">If you have questions, don't be afraid to ask, even off-hours over email.  He'll respond in less than a day (sometimes even less than an hour!)</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Levine was extremely caring and responsive while I was in his care.  We did 2 retrieval cycles with him with full chromosomal testing.  The first cycle failed to produce any healthy embryos and we were devastated.  Dr. Levine spent a long time carefully explaining what the results meant, and also what he learned from them about our specific situation.  He gave us some recommendations for how to proceed if we wanted to cycle again, and also what he thought our chance of success would be going forward. He recommended we take time off to help us heal psychologically, and was clearly concerned with our well-being overall.

During our second cycle, he carefully monitored every step, and tweaked things as needed. He is incredibly responsive over email, and makes himself available for calls or questions regardless of whether it's a weekday or business hours. Dr. Levine is warm and friendly, and good at explaining the science behind things, which mattered to us as well.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The first cycle I believe was fairly standard - menopur and follistim. I had 10 eggs retrieved, 7 were mature, 6 successfully fertilized, 2 made it to blastocyst for testing, but 0 were healthy.

Dr. Levine had me take 2 months off between cycles so that I could take some steps to improve my chances. I did acupuncture 2x a week, took a large CoQ-10 supplement daily, cooked nearly all of my meals myself with an eye towards minimizing insulin responses and eating unprocessed foods, reduced my work schedule and generally reduced my stress level.

For the second cycle, he did the Lupron antagonist protocol.  I only had 6 eggs retrieved, but all 6 fertilized.  All 6 made it to blastocyst.  3 were healthy.  We have transferred 1 of those 3 (which is now a 7-week pregnancy), and have the other 2 cryogenically frozen for future children.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The nursing staff was kind and responsive. They provided good education regarding medication and how to administer it. They get to know you as a person and genuinely care about your treatment and how you're doing.

The nursing staff sometimes struggles drawing blood (though, to be fair, I have notoriously difficult veins).  In addition, sometimes the communication regarding drug changes and refills had to be initiated by me instead of by them.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">This clinic offers highly personalized and sophisticated fertility treatments. The space is relaxing (more like a spa than a clinic), clean, and conveniently located in Manhattan.

When we were first choosing a clinic (after a disastrous 3 months at Columbia's practice), I called CCRM NY with some questions.  Instead of directing me to their website or SART data, they actually were able to put me on the phone with the head of the embryo lab! She spent about a half hour on the phone with me answering all kinds of questions about IVF in general, and their specific practices. It was an impressive level of access, but that is just par for the course with CCRM NY.  If you are a patient (or even a possible patient), they treat you with incredible attention, respect and consideration. It's basically the difference between a 3 Michelin star meal and McDonalds. I would recommend them to anyone considering fertility treatment. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">For a retrieval and frozen embry transfer cycle, including ICSI, embryo biopsy and cryopresevation it was about $22,000.  In addition, the CCS testing ran anywhere from $500-1,500 (depending on how many embryos).

Note that if there isn't a viable embryo (so, no transfer), about $4,000 of the $22,000 could either be refunded to you or applied to another cycle.

None of this includes the medications.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Levine highly recommended an eSET because we had a very high quality embryo to use. He said that the other two embryos were a bit lower quality, and so if we ever have another transfer, we may want to consider doing both at once to help improve the odds.

That said, he is generally opposed to multiple embryo transfer, as it is less healthy, even if it can help the odds.</div>]"

He wanted to leave no stone unturned and made sure that I had hysterosalpingogram performed and recommended an excellent doctor to do it.  He recommended my husband have a karyotype.  He looked into my prolactin levels and wanted to make sure to address the slight elevation.  He wanted me to look into my questionable aspirin allergy in case I needed anti-coagulation in the future.  He was very, very thorough.  We agreed to do a frozen cycle although we were more interested in a fresh cycle.  It seems they don’t do many fresh cycles there.  They also encourage we do PGD testing.  Given our past experience with high numbers of 5 day embryos (13 blasts in 4 cycles) and only 1 normal by PGD which was transferred but did not work,  we did not want to do PGD testing this time around.  The only unexpected issue was that we expected a lot from the laboratory and the incubators there at CCRM which he explained were top notch.  Given we agreed to a frozen cycle, they pushed our 7 embryos past 5 days which had never been done with the previous IVF clinic we used. He explained they looked good at day 3 and then started to slow down and then basically stopped developing.  So we never got to the transfer stage.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">It seems their standard is the frozen cycle with PGD testing.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">He spent a lot of time with us during our consultations.

Not only did he treat ME like a human, but HE was an authentic human as well. We communicated like normal 2017 humans, via email and text, on the regular.

Our journey began in a state of panic when my wife learned that her ovarian reserve, her FSH levels pointed towards essentially a diminished ovarian reserve, poor egg quality that helped explained a couple of miscarriages she had naturally.   Through online research, we determined that her numbers may not even qualify us for many IVF clinics because the possibility of a pregnancy was very low and naturally clinics would see that working against their success statistics.  Dr. Levine didn't once use numbers to determine whether he would see us or treat us.  He made the time right away and sat down with us and focused on listening to us.

At our very first appointment, Dr. Levine focused on asking very detailed questions about our history, our family history and my wife's pregnancy history.  What we most appreciated was that while he clearly understood our numbers, he took the time to understand our priorities, and why the pregnancy was important to us.   After listening to us for a while, he very thoughtfully pondered our options and then explained them to us.   He gave us a clear understanding of our chances and then laid out a plan for how to start.   

My wife and I left the office feeling hopeful that at least we were going to have a strong partner in this journey irrespective of where it led us.

Thereafter began a year long journey that started with an IUI and two IVF cycles.  At each step of the way, Dr. Levine took the time to talk to us personally and explain us the process, the risks and the chances of success.   He also took the time to give us clinical depth about why we were seeing certain results such as a disappointing first IUI and no embryos from the first IVF cycle.  

After our first IVF cycle, we were at a very disheartening cross-road about whether to keep trying or abandon our efforts.   Dr. Levine gave us not just the positive courage but a solid, scientific and statistical understanding and the exact treatment that he planned to pursue based on the learning from the first cycle.   He also coordinated some natural treatment for my wife such as accupuncture and yoga where he made personal calls to the acupuncture doctor to coordinate the treatment path.

At no point did Dr. Levine pressure us to jump right into the next cycle.   He cautioned towards making sure my wife's body was ready.   We took our time and then resumed another cycle that commenced in a positive pregnancy for my wife (currently 11 weeks and 4 days).

Now we have transitioned to an OB GYN and Dr. Levine on his own makes an effort to stay in touch about my wife's progress.   

We can go on and on but all in all i would advise anyone that few (if any) are lucky to go through an IVF and get straightforward results.  It is always a journey.  Every patient is unique, and brings their own circumstances.   You want a doctor who is going to meet you where you are in your journey.   Dr. Levine is exactly that doctor.  </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I would say take the time to do your research and ask questions.  It is important for Dr. Levine to know that you are personally engaged in the process.   However, don't push your own method or agenda based on your research.  Dr. Levine is experienced, knowledgeable and has done thousands of retrievals and transfers.   Don't read into his youthfulness and positivism any more than he always you to leave happy from his office (no matter how hard the circumstances).   He knows what he is doing, is advised by a very strong team and will keep your interests in mind.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Not once in our entire experience with CCRM NY team and specifically Dr. Levine did we ever feel like a number.  Every interaction whether it was making an appointment, following up on a billing question, requesting directions on medications and/or most importantly the time we spent with Dr. Levine was with utmost respect, care and compassion about our specific situation.   It was always amazing to see that everyone always knew where we were in the cycle, the protocol we were following, our history and our concerns.  Dr. Levine was almost never in a rush.  He took the time to talk to us , hear us and always responded to our questions whether in person, via email or sometimes even text messages when we were nervous.   I would go as far as saying that my wife and I felt like we were the ONLY patients at CCRM because of the love, care, and time we received.   We are so grateful to Dr. Levine and his team for the journey they brought us on and the results they delivered.
&amp;lt;I will call out that the online survey here does not allow for ""Current Active Pregnancy"".   As such we have selected Live Birth - Singleton as the option even though my wife is 11 weeks 4 days pregnant at this point&amp;gt;</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">We started with an IUI with Clomid treatment that did not result in a positive pregnancy.   We were aware the chances are low.
On the first IVF cycle we used a standard protocol of Follistom, Menopur and Lupron shots every day, followed by an HCG trigger and retrieval.
On the second cycle Dr. Levine used a protocol of Follistom, Menopur, Cetrotide and Lupron towards the end, that resulted in many more eggs and higher quality as we had fertilization.  Calcium and ICSi were used to help with Fertilization.  Following the genetic testing, he put my wife on birth control pill for 5 weeks, with lupron shots the last 2 weeks in the evening.   Leading up to the transfer and thereafter he used a combination of progresterone shots, supposetries and estrogen patches.  &amp;lt;happy to provide more detail if you need it&amp;gt; </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">The nurse, care coordinator is a crucial part of the team and the process as you go through an IVF cycle.  At CCRM we found the staff to highly professional, well trained, caring and most importantly very responsive to all our questions.   The nurses always took the time to explain the treatment, laid out a specific calendar customized just for my wife, and did a great job of giving us instructions based on her blood work after each visit.  

I really can't think of any weaknesses.   On occasion the timing of instructions could get a little delayed because they received the blood from us late and/or it was very busy.   However, they maintained a very high standard of always getting us instructions for treatment every day.   

As anyone who has been thru this journey would tell you - needles become your close friends, and often an unnerving part of the process.  The nurses at CCRM showed us and even at times administered the shot for my wife so i can see and then follow at home.   

When my wife finally got a positive result, the team at CCRM reached out personally and congratulated her and gave her very warm greetings.   It just goes out to show that these are people who really love what they do and want every patient to go home with the results they want.   They make each patient feel like they are the only ones at CCRM.

The best part about this team was that they all backed each other up and everyone knew our history and our protocol.   There were 4-5 nurses but each of them knew our case, and any one of them could answer our questions.   That was tremendous.  It also helped if any one person was out of office. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">I'll say that the clinic itself is only as good as the people and doctors that work there.  To that end, all my comments to now about Dr. Levine, his team and his nursing team truly speak for the value and experience of CCRM NY.  
With that said, the clinic has amazing facilities.  They are located well, easy to get to (particularly when you have to go there frequently), have world class facilities and a very good embryology team that is very responsive when you are trying to get a daily status on the embryos development.   
Another SUPER important member of the team were Stephanie and Gina, the front desk team that booked our appointments and checked us in.  They were superb, and always very accommodating of our schedule.  They were often the folks we interacted with the most and we really loved our experience with them.  I would be remiss if i didn't acknowledge their contribution and support on our journey.

CCRM NY just opened in New York a few years ago and so i can imagine that as time goes and they grow more, they will likely need more space and facilities. </div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">$21000 for a single cycle retrieval and transfer all the way up to first ultrasound.  The costs were split usually as approximately $8000 for transfer and supporting protocols, and $11000 for retrieval, and about $1000 for anesthesia during retrieval.   This does not include cost of any injectable hormones or post-transfer patches/supposetries.</div>, <div class=""review-question__response"">Dr. Levine did not have a preference.

We did 3 IUIs with negative result and 1 IVF cycle. We have one beautiful child and got really lucky. I guess you have to be positive in this business to survive all the despair. This comes with a mixed review from us, however. 

The wholly optimistic and positive outlook left us feeling crushed every time we got a negative pregnancy result, of which there were several. Personally, we felt “led on” to expect positive results and when that didn’t happen, the fall was incredibly harsh; more so than it would have been with more neutral expectations. We pleaded with Dr. Levine to give us the blunt stats, and although he did, he always spun it somehow to lead us to believe “this was the one that would work”.  When it didn’t, we were heartbroken and started not to trust the Polly Anna-like attitude. I guess it was self perseveration. 

On the other hand, now, in hindsight, with an absolutely perfect 6-month daughter, I question what it would have been like without this positivity. I don’t know how anyone could continue to try and try again, including the doctor, without hope, real or false. 

So, the mixed review has to do mostly with setting really high expectations that led to a crushing reality numerous times and loss of trust...until it didn’t. 

We would highly recommend Dr. Levine.

Clomid 
Dexamethasone 
Follistim
Ganirelix/Cetrotide
HCG
Lupron 


Doxycycline (for Partner) 

Had great results that quickly dwindled. I had over 20 follicles. Only Pulled 12 eggs. 8 survived the night. 6 fertilized. 4 embryos made it to day 3-6.
