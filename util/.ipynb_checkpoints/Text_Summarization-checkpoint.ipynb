       "\"The second IUI I had was done with two male doctors (I don't remember names) and it took them 20 minutes with both of them between my legs trying to do it. Their new billing system is extremely organized and I like how they assign a billing person to each patient for direct communication. The needle pricks are to a minimum and they do a better job than most hospital nurses. The office is bright, clean, and comfortable with complimentary refreshments. Conceptions Florida is a very busy clinic but everyone in the medical team is very attentive and responsive. If insurance wasn't covering my treatment I would be really concerned about the confusion if I was the one paying for all these tests. Again I was there sometimes twice a week. After such outstanding level of care and professionalism I decide to switch all my doctors to Columbia doctors!The clinic is beautiful, newly renovated and clean. There was always someone I could ask to get any question answered. office looks clean and busy, they offer very flexible appointments the atmosphere is very calm and relaxing, in general I was very satisfied  wit the service I got in Columbia University Medical Center. I understand that a cattle call isn't always a bad thing - it can show that the clinic is organized and efficient in how they see patients. They do not have many lab techs to take blood work. The strengths are in that it is approachable, smart, and helpful. Overall the experience thus far has been very smooth and positive.\""
