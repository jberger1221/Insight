0,Columbia University Fertility,Doctor,Positive," She is an excellent doctor, who treats her patients at a very personal level Dr Brady took care of us and everything worked great for us The entire team of Dr Brady is very helpful, professional and listens to patient concerns with care and these issues are properly taken care offI wish I could give them more than 5 stars and especially to Dr Brady, who is an excellent consultant and above all a great human being We felt honored to have been her patients She makes you very comfortable during the entire procedure and ensures that you are not stressed during any phase in any way So, when I felt low or felt nervous on some issue, I would contact Dr Brady and she would reply that ""it's fine"" or ""it will get better"" or ""its pretty normal"" made me feel great, even if I were not feeling good earlier These words may seem pretty simple in normal English but believe me, coming from your physician when you are in distress works wonder and Dr Brady is great in communicating them in such a way that these lines would act as healer for meThere aren't enough words to describe how amazing Dr Eric Forman and the staff at Columbia Fertility Center are It felt like everything was done for us Long story short, after several months we had a successful IVF in the first try :) Every doctor we worked with was incredible but our favorite by far was Dr Brady We are definitely coming back for baby #2 :) Dr Brady was incredibly knowledgeable, professional, supportive and super sweet  The staff was so friendly they felt like extended family while going through the ups and downs that can occur with fertility woes  Over the course of two years there were many who I interacted with and I would call out their names but I don't want to leave anyone out! It was a happy day to ""graduate"" and be released to my ob gyn with hugs and high fives from the staff and Dr Forman!  Fast forward to almost a year later and I'm a first time parent to a happy and healthy baby girl Dr Karipcin was amazing and we were lucky to have her She's a caring and compassionate doctor She was very supportive of me going forward with IVF, so we felt very confident under her care Dr Forman is an open book and has the fastest response rate of pretty much anyone I've ever emailed with, period Columbia really has thought about all of the intricacies and has done a great job making it as streamlined as possible for patients Dr Sinem Karipcin (Dr K) was positive, warm, and laughed with us through the good and bad times! I could not recommend Columbia more Dr Karipcin was our doctor and she was amazing She is a smart, competent, and dedicated professional She is just a wonderfully compassionate and warm person From the very beginning till the end, she was very knowledgeable, attentive and considerate, and she was always easy to talk to and responded to our questions both in person and via emailMy husband and I had the good fortune of being connected to Dr Forman during our journey through conception From the day we met with Dr Eric Forman it was all positive and promising Instead, they have given us more than promised at every appointment with respect to their time and answers to every question that we hadDr McConnell was amazing She is passionate about her work, she is rewarded internally when she experiences her patients become moms-to-beMy husband and I are extremely joyful that we had the experience to work with Dr McConnell, as our fertility specialistDr Forman and the team at Columbia are among the very best out there Dr Forman is the most responsive, accessible doctor I have ever worked with: he always answered emails within the day, sometimes within minutes, and he was willing to have lengthy phone conversations with me to go over any and every question I had He is extremely knowledgeable and willing to share as much granular information as you need; I always felt I could question the particular reasoning behind a decision to understand it better but also trust his expertise Dr Forman always treated me as an individual, as he adjusted my protocols over the course of treatment to get better and better outcomes Dr Forman checked in with the office and emailed me while on his vacation to tell me that my blood test results were positive and that the IVF round was successful While there are many women that go through their offices every day, every doctor and nurse cares about the individual patientWe came to Columbia after reading the positive reviews on Fertility IQ, particularly for Dr Forman Dr Forman is caring and highly communicative (no other doctor has ever emailed me to keep me informed at each stage), and really takes all the delicate factors (labs, insurance, age, etc She is *extremely* knowledgeable, answered all of my questions, and has a very comforting bedside manner which is so important Me and my husband both felt confident that we were in the best hands possible  She has an excellent bedside manner and takes time to explain everything with her patients  She really seems to care about her patients and makes sure to go beyond to make sure you are comfortable throughout the entire processDr Forman was one of the best doctors I've every encountered in my lifeI would like to recommend Dr Rogerio Lobo as he is one of the most polite and patient doctor that I have come across He listens very well to his patient's needs and provide sound advice I just had my baby girl and if it wasn't for his advice and care, I would not have gone thru some of the challenges and have our beautiful daughterDr Forman listened to my concerns and is very good with first time IVF patients He consistently went above and beyond for me the entire time I was in his care A perfect example of this was when I had expressed how much I wanted him to perform the actual IVF procedure rather than another doctor from the clinicDr Williams is the most amazing Dr He is kind, caring and compassionateEverybody is very kind and caring She was so patient and  answered all of our questions in detail and thoughtfully always She paid attention to my bloodwork and scans and was spot on and made sure my protocol fit me I never felt like just the ""next"" patient but truly like they cared I could go on and on but honestly Dr McConnell was simply the best and so knowledgeable especially with any ideas I brought to her attentionI live in New Hampshire and feel so incredibly grateful to have been referred to the Columbia University Fertility Center and Dr Williams The care that I received from Dr Williams and his team was unlike any other Dr Williams made himself available to me during all hours of the day and expressed the most sincere, intent care Thank you all for all that you have done for our family!  We are truly, truly grateful! All of these qualities separated him from the other doctors in my mind and gave me constant reassurance and confidence that we had chosen the right doctor, staff and facilitySaw Dr Forman a few weeks back and very happy with my experience Dr Forman was very thorough and had a great bedside mannerOur whole experience in the center was wonderful! Dr Forman was so fantastic! Dr Forman assisted us through every step of this scary and exciting process He is kind, detailed and always available Dr McConnell is brilliant and also kind and comforting throughout what can be a very anxiety-producing process I mainly see her in the Westchester office, but I have been to the new Manhattan location as well and it's amazing!! I had an appointment with Dr Forman once when Dr McConnell was out of the office and he seemed great as well Dr Forman was so supportive, responsive, caring, and knowledgeable! He was there for us every step of the way and took the time to explain the process He truly wants to be there for his patients and always answered my questions over email without delay! I was blown away by the amazing level of care - especially after my husband and I had a negative experience with another fertility clinic Dr Forman was compassionate, informative, and supportive We undertook one round of IVF with Dr Forman and were successful - he helped us beat the odds",2.7777777777777777
1,Columbia University Fertility,Doctor,Negative," Both my husband and I have been very demanding in our attention from the doctor and his team and we got nothing short of it We began our journey nervous and very unsure of what to expect I felt bad emailing him on the weekends because I knew that he would answer within hours and I did not want to take him away from his family Over the course of my journey, I got to know the staff so well that I felt sad leaving to my regular obgyn As a high risk patient, I was very nervous about finding the right doctor who understood my condition and I had the extremely good fortune of being connected with Dr Brady who could not have been more caring and thorough Of course, no one answered the phone upon me calling Yet, every time I see a false bill from them my stress level goes upHe and his team understood that these things mattered and what a difference it makes when your concerns are taken seriously I can not recommend Dr Forman and the entire team - doctors, nurses, techs, etc - highly enough",2.7777777777777777
2,Columbia University Fertility,Doctor,Neutral," Dr Forman always took his time explaining, answering our questions, and never made us feel rushed I was able to contact Dr Forman at any time and always received a quick reply whether by email or by phone  Spends a lot of time detailing plans but then doesn't actually follow through Once, when she was done with a procedure with a different patient, she quickly came to see me to personally review my ultrasound and speak to me I was specifically a patient of Dr Forman and his bedside manner is exceptional She was extremely patient with me, answering (in detail) any and numerous questions that crossed my mind He was professional and informative but also explained everything in language that we could understand  I went for a routine visit and had a general question and she went through the history of my chart to respond in a way that was suited for my individual programJessica and Edelith was very polite and sensitive towards me knowing the reason why I am coming to see the doctor I actually teared up when I saw him I rarely find a doctor who I feel is just as invested in my case as I am, and Dr Williams and the group exceeded all of my expectations He always responded to any question or concern I had within a hour or less even when he was on vacation All he doctors in the practice we encountered were just the same She is patient with me and answers all of my questions, and I never feel rushedLet me start off by saying that I'm writing this as my 5 week old son is napping in the other room After seeing many fertility specialists on Long Island and in the city we found Dr Eric Forman",2.7777777777777777
3,Columbia University Fertility,Advice,Positive," She prepares a road map for a patient and follow it up till the end, which I really liked about her There is nothing ambiguous about her plan, she makes everything simple and clear She is an expert of her field and very knowledgeable care provider in her field of expertise One can be inspired in many ways from herWhile going through all this, you don't only need medications but you also need support and kind words from your medical team as wellIf anyone is considering a fertility program, I would sincerely advise to consult Columbia Fertility and look for Dr Brady as she is the best resource And one last advice, when you become her patient, trust on her judgement and her team and believe me "" It will get better""Thank you, Dr Forman, for helping us become parents of an amazing baby boy After such outstanding level of care and professionalism I decide to switch all my doctors to Columbia doctors! We will definitely go back to her if we decide to have a 2nd baby! Dr Forman and the entire Columbia Fertility staff are the nicest people you'll ever come across throughout your fertility journey No question is dumb or too small for him He gets how stressful of a process this is for you and truly does everything he can to make you feel as comfortable and well informed as possible Thank you doctor! In addition he makes it very clear that he cares about your overall health Columbia university fertility center has the most inviting caregivers We are blessed to be associated with them and Dr Forman The best team to go to if you're looking for the right doctor for IVF While he seems a bit quiet and not super warm/fuzzy at first, he clearly cares about his patients--who else calls the evening before a retrieval to check if you have any last questions and wish you luck??--and goes above and beyond to help Dr Forman is everything you could want and more in a doctorDr Rachel McConnell is an outstanding physician She gives you hope and leaves you feeling confident in her capable and caring handsLoved all the staff at Columbia University FertilityI am extremely happy with this center Dr Forman is the best Doctor Thank you Dr Lobo! Nothing was too small for his attention and he's always doing his best for you Peri, the Egg Donor Program Coordinator, is especially great I would highly recommend him and his practice They truly made the experience better as tough as this is experience is Thank you and I hope to see everyone with my double rainbow baby Unsure of where to begin or how to start this daunting process, we decided to meet with a Dr at Columbia and essentially took a leap of faith Completely trust his opinions and have switched to him as a result",2.7777777777777777
4,Columbia University Fertility,Advice,Negative," I would often bother her with issues, which may not be of great significance but she would always get back very quickly either through email or phoneDoctor was all talk no action I frequently emailed him serious and silly questions and he always answered quickly Even on days he wasn't scheduled to perform certain procedures, he made it a point to be there anyway for his patientsI cannot say enough good things about my experience with Dr Forman and the team at Columbia's fertility centerI cannot say enough great things about this practice He is also very knowledgeable and would not simply just recommend any invasive procedures Save yourself the aggravation, frustration and heartbreak",2.7777777777777777
5,Columbia University Fertility,Advice,Neutral, She would even reply emails on SundaysMy husband and I decided on Columbia after stumbling upon an insanely high review of Dr Forman via a blog post (and then further review stalking on Fertility IQ) She will always be a part of our family) of a patient's unique profile into consideration She expressed to me come up to the penthouse and check it outHe takes his time getting to know you and your needs,2.7777777777777777
6,Columbia University Fertility,Nurse,Positive,"I would especially mention that even during this stressful Corona pandemic, she really managed everything so well and she ensured that I wasn't effected by it in anyway, for which I am really grateful to her She was always in touch and her entire team was on top of everything She answered all our questions, answered our emails promptly, and was always positive We were so lucky to have worked with her They are great! Dr Rackow and my care team (nurse and care coordinator) were such a pleasure to work with and extremely thorough and informative He was positive and reassuring and was ALWAYS available to answer any and all questions And the staff are equally as caring and helpful From the very first step of receiving information to the end of my process, Dr Brady along with her team, Sherry and Varda, truly made me feel very comfortable and made the journey much easier  The staff are always courteous and Dr Paula Brady is amazing  He's pragmatic, kind,compassionate, so responsive, and super on top of everything Jenny who takes your blood is so kind and skilled and such a pleasure The nurses are great She was incredibly helpful and reliableWe have partnered with Dr Rachel McConnell and so beyond happy with her The morning monitoring was always so prompt in both offices as well He was truly understanding and personable, had amazing communication and response time - no question too inconsequential or too complicated to re-explain and is SUPER informative His nurse Tiffany is the sweetest and most kind and loving person She really taker her time to make you feel safe and taken care of Lastly, the front desk team and Tara, always helpful, friendly and attentiveThis place is wonderful!

They make you feel welcome, they are fast, and they communicate well Of course there were bad days, hormonal days, sad days, but through it all my care team was supportive! The nurses smile at you and they try to all learn your name The only downside is that I WISH that Dr K could be my OBGYN and deliver my baby! When we arrived at Columbia Fertility, we were impressed with the facility It was welcoming, bright, and new, everything you want from a clinic The receptionists were all nice and pleasant The nurses and technicians became like friends They were supportive and friendly, at a time when you really need to see a smileWe had a wonderful experience here, primarily because of dr BradyThe Columbia Fertility Center has been amazing! I started seeing them less than a year ago for IVF and they have been very helpful every step of the way During the monitoring phases of IVF you may not always see your doctor but that never made me feel uncomfortable because they were all warm and supportive of your concerns We have never met with a more attentive, caring, compassionate and empathic doctor and facilityI had a great experience with Columbia Fertility and would highly recommend to anyone I felt like I was in great hands throughout my entire experience The people at the front desk were always so friendly and helpful Being a teacher, the monitoring hours worked for me and they were able to accommodate me by giving me one of the first appointments I have recommended Columbia fertility to many people and we are eternally grateful for everything they have done for us We have our family thanks to her!!

The Columbia team as a whole has been wonderful - from the front desk, to the nurses, to the staff who coordinate medications, everyone has been professional and sensitive, and things have moved along seamlessly Infertility is physically and emotionally draining, but my husband and I have been able to relax somewhat knowing that they have everything under control here I had a wonderful experience at Columbia Fertility from consultation to conception The office staff, nurses, care coordinators -- they are all so kind and attentive (and the office itself is very relaxing + clean They were very helpful and compassionate  I have been to 3 different centers and this is by far the most thorough, most courteous, caring and treats each patient as though you are their only patient After leaving this agency, I went to New Hope Fertility Center and I'm finally pregnant Incredibly knowledgeable, attentive and warm Every person that works here is truly wonderful The people at the reception desk are amazing They really try to get you in and out as easily as possible I will be forever grateful to all of these people for everything they've done for me These things mean the world to women who have no control over their bad fortune Even the front desk and nurses who draw blood exhibited the same standard of care Her staff In Scarsdale and the city were just the best They always made sure they called/emailed me with any information and results and were very sympathetic They were caring, kind, brilliant, and progressive I previously saw another Dr in Brooklyn, but my experience at Columbia Fertility Clinic was like night and day All the nurses in the center who assisted us and did our Lab work (on what felt almost daily) were so professional and kind I can't say enough wonderful things of this entire practice! I am so happy we chose Columbia University Fertility! We are so blessed that all went perfectly and we are expecting a baby, May 1st! THANK YOU to the fantastic team or caring professionals! The process of scheduling appointments is seamless, and I adore all of the nurses, secretaries, and phlebotomists I have interacted with So grateful for their entire team! Would highly recommend staying away from Columbia ",2.7777777777777777
10,Columbia University Fertility,Clinic,Negative," This was probably the most non-overwhelming doctor experience I have ever had The wait time for appointments is either nonexistent or extremely low considering other doctors offices I've been tooMy husband and I came to Columbia Fertility after having a terrible experience with another fertility doctor in Manhattan who made me feel old and defective I never had to wait more than ten minutes for morning monitoring--very important when you're squeezing these many appointments into the early hours before work! IVF is such a stressful experience, and you want to work with experts who will make it as manageable as possible This communication is above and beyond and the whole team at Columbia never made me feel like there was a silly or stupid questionThey have attempted to re-brand themselves with a new office and new Yelp page, but this is the same old crappy CWRC with a new name But, I do blame them for not having their billing situation togetherI've been a patient here for about a year and can't say enough good things It was bittersweet and felt strange as we have bonded and felt at home with everyoneOMG this practice thinks they can get away from all their horrible reviews because they rebranded themselves and got a nice lil makeover but this place is still as crappy as it was before This place sucks",2.7777777777777777
11,Columbia University Fertility,Clinic,Neutral," Even when you call them at a very short notice, they get back to you quite quickly Everyone was on point I didn't have to remind or explain anything to anyone We were always updated the same day after our appointment A few specific logistical perks of Columbia are that they make morning monitoring appointments for you (as opposed to first come, first served, walk-in time frames which is how a lot of other places do it) Additionally, procedures are done on-site in the back surgical room (as opposed to going to the corresponding hospital which is also how other places seem to do it) No matter what route you end up taking to get pregnant, there are a ton of appointments involved The wait for appointments and morning monitoring was never long  A lot of women use this center for their fertility and it's incredible how the office is able to manage it I have never sat in the waiting room for a long time, even when it is busy The office also runs smoothly There were some days that I waited longer than usual to be seen but it did not happen often The reviews have proven to be spot on Just got off the phone with their billing person and he couldn't even explain why I was receiving bills and told me to call the fixer or customer service person at ColumbiaI went to this office for the first time mainly due to seeing Jen the pheblemist in the elevator Also the front desk is so professional and resourceful The wait is minimal if at all They are very attentive and available when you need them From the front desk staff, to the billing team, to the clinical team, we were blown away The doctors suck - they don't give a shit and never return your calls There was not one phone call - during or after hours - which was not returned to us outside of 20 min",2.7777777777777777
12,Columbia University Fertility,Protocol,Positive," The way Dr Brady used to say those things made my body believe that ""its pretty normal"" and it is very important in this treatment Dr Forman broke down the process step by step for each procedure and made sure all was understood No stress no confusion thanks in part to the efforts of the former CWRC aka Columbia University Fertility I'm happy to have chosen Columbia to address my fertility issues years ago! Currently we are expecting a healthy baby!!!!!! I continued my pregnancy with Columbia doctors and continued to have a great experience I don't need any stress in my life during this pregnancy I am so happy thus far I did After more research, we decided to switch to Dr Eric Forman for our first (and successful!!) IVF cycle and SO happy we did So happy I was recommended here!!I am so glad that I chose to use Columbia when my husband and I struggled to conceive We were only given a 20% chance of successfully conceiving",2.7777777777777777
13,Columbia University Fertility,Protocol,Negative," My husband and I have been trying to conceive for years but was not having any luck We've been with Columbia this entire time, and couldn't be happier with our decision We can't recommend her enough Can't recommend Dr Forman highly enough It's really not acceptable The day of the procedure, it wasn't guaranteed that he could make it but he rushed to the clinic and made it happenI can't recommend Columbia University Fertility Center enough I ended up doing two (failed) cycles of IUI last year with the Doctor we had first met with at Columbia I could not recommend Dr Forman enough!Had bad experience that lead to emergent surgery as opposed to semi-urgent surgery if diagnosed earlier",2.7777777777777777
14,Columbia University Fertility,Protocol,Neutral," She considers her patients as humans, understands them and design the program accordingly for each patient individually based on the specific requirements of the patients It all changed when we met Dr Forman Overall, the process was lengthy, but we were able to conceive on our first round of IVF We didn't know what to expect when we first decided to go to the fertility center Finally, instead of taking an injection class, we were able to sit down one-on-one with a nurse to go over the processIt took us 45 years to get pregnant! I had some uterus issues, and we did 2 egg retrievals and 3 embryo transfers (3rd one worked!) I write this as my two week old naps Maybe it just wasn't my month After less than a yr with her we are finally pregnant and graduated from the facility Fingers crossed!",2.7777777777777777
15,Columbia University Fertility,Cost,Positive," I went to Columbia in July 2018, paid over $13K up front for a cycle that ended up not working, and fast forward to Dec 2018/Jan 2019 and I'm still receiving bills from them! It seems like Columbia is trying to double dip! They collected my money up front, and then tried to bill my insurance too On top of  trying to charge me for monitoring services that I previously paid for before the start of the cycle, they are trying to charge me $1200 for frozen embryos that aren't even normal I don't blame Columbia for my cycle not working",2.7777777777777777
16,Columbia University Fertility,Cost,Negative,"  No thanks for this place Can't thank you all enough She paid close attention to my body through bloodwork, which directed her to give me an IVF treatment that was catered for my body The billing system is terrible - still receiving bills from 2013",2.7777777777777777

21,New Hope Fertility Center,Doctor,Positive," He was always kind, patient and positive, calling me each time he changed the medicine dosage to explain why or when the process did not go according to plan We used a surrogate and Tiffany, like Dr Liu, was a sincere cheerleader I felt taken care of, unlike with other practitioners who saw me with a dollar sign in their eyes and that I was just another battery farm hen I am so grateful to Dr Liu and his team for giving me the best gift of motherhood New Hope Fertility was my answered prayer to starting my family and I'm grateful to be on this journey with such an phenomenal place Just want to thank Dr Liu from new hope fertility who has helped me through this ivf process the last two years He is amazing, patient, supportive, compassionate and took such great care of me We are extremely grateful he has helped bless us with a blessing we thought was never possible When I first met with the doctor she was nice, but talked to me for 5 minutes before doing the ultrasound When she did the ultrasound she said ""looks like you may have some endometriosis  I came in with very low expectations for customer service, doctor ""bedside manner"" and the like, HOWEVER, I was very much blown away by how I was treated  I had my consultation with Dr Olcha who very clearly drew out diagrams on his ipad and explained EVERYTHING to me and my partner  Partner and I really enjoyed our experience with the doctor and team  Nope, I've gone at least a handful of times (even more in the future) and every time had a professional and respectful experience  My emails are promptly responded to and when I email Dr Olcha, he emails me back, right away!  I get a faster response from Dr Olcha than some of my work colleagues, lolz Doctor Zhang is very attentive and passionate about what he does, he is hopeful and realistic at the same time Wish me luck! I am writing​ this review because I would like to express my appreciation​ to Dr Merhi He really is the best doctor I have met in my life He is kind, compassionate, having a ​positive​ vibe and very professional at​​ the same time​​ Long story short, when I had a problem with NHFC, Dr Merhi called me to make sure if everything was okUpdate:I used to recommend this place to everyone but they are really struggling to keep up Dr Zhang is really good at what he does I only had optimism and not really a clear picture on what my issues really wereUpdate Update!!!!I changed my insurance and thanks to Dr Yang and his staff I am 9 weeks pregnant with my twins!! I did one cycle/round of IVF and our dreams are coming true!! We are over the moon happy!! I know this sounds crazy but I am going to miss the staff! They were always so pleasant and positive and that kept me motivated I feel like they treat patient like numberDr Merhi is wonderful  Any time I've wanted to speak to the doctor, he makes time for me He listens to the patient and is not interested in personal results and stats but is genuinely interested in the well being of his patient He makes himself available to answer questions and is very reassuring I am highly impressed with this clinic and unequivocally recommend NHFC and particularly, Dr Merhi  I am so thankful that I did because I found a clinic and doctor who have made the process so much easier by treating me like a human being  Yes we had success and recently delivered a beautiful healthy baby girl, but I felt the whole process was smooth and very attentive It should be noted that we were regularly reminded how poor our odds of success were, and the doctor agreed that stopping made sense We replied that we were asking to be acknowledged in some way and treated like individuals but received no further response The first thing Dr Zhang told us was that ""there is no problem with you, tests are all good, all you need to do is to nourish your body and get ready"" Hey, we made it after all these years of pain and desperation, and we are really proud of ourselves and our 2 kids!In a nutshell, we are very grateful to Dr Zhang who made our dream come true, and to his conviction of combining Western technology with Chinese cultivation/nourishment methodology I feel like the nurses really handled my care this time without consulting with doctors I ended up seeing Dr Olcha who was great and held my hand through the whole process!Dr Merhi was lovely He was very straightforward, and gave practical advice for our situation, which we followed and had a successful natural IUI at our first try!  He was very nice on the phone and asked us to try again  The doctor admitted that another doctor looked our case while he was on vacation  Though our journey was very long and difficult, the door at NHFC never closed,  Dr Zhang recommended mini IVFs with much less medications and my body and mind were peaceful and comfortable with cycles  With great thanks to Dr Zhang, Dr Lui, Joanna (nurse) and Chisa (embryologist) who supported us thru this difficulty journey, our life changed with this miracle baby o(^-^)oDr Merhi at the New Hope Fertility Center was referred to me for fertility treatment From our initial visit, we fell in love with Dr Merhi He is very attentive to his patients, caring, comforting, personable and has a great sense of humor Dr Merhi was amazing through it all! He was extremely attentive, patient and strategic in helping us overcome any hurdles that we encounteredAt New Hope you are treated like a number, like a cog in an assembly line rather than a human beingI am Dr Merhi's patient (AMAZING) almost done with my cycle and due to external circumstances I need to stop and travel home to Texas to see my family I was riding down the elevator and the sweetest blonde woman asked me how I was feeling She helped me figure out my situation in terms of my next cycle and financially within 10 minutesDr Zaher Merhi was great and he always answered my questions in a timely manner Thank you for completely changing our lives, Dr Makarov! Dr Merhi is a very sympathetic and knowledgable doctor who helped us out in just a few quick visits I almost gave up but Dr Zaher Merhi gave me encouragement and prayer that gave me the strength to press on and I'm truly grateful!I was Dr Yang's patient, everything went great with him, he's the only doctor who gave me confident and hope so far New Hope Fertility center haven't given me any notification who will follow my case, and who will give me further instructions  We had our baby boy!  He is perfect My initial conference with Dr Zhang was very pleasant Dr Zhang on first impressions was kind, honest, enthusiastic, very knowledgeable and put us on a less aggressive program than what we had been on My wife is Japanese and I would say the approach and environment does lend itself to an Asian feel, so she felt more comfortable in that respect too He was always so supportive and communicative, letting me know the exact next steps and eased all my worries and concerns He genuinely loves his job of granting miracles to infertility patients And Dr Liu who did some of my retrievals and transfer is simply amazing and very pleasant to work with I can only speak for myself when I say that this place was amazing and Dr Merhi is a blessing Dr Merhi is literally the most pleasant person alive--- he answered all of my questions immediately and as a result, I recommended him to all of my friends  I highly recommend Dr Merhi our doctor who was truly the best as we hit various obstacles  His compassion and care for what he does makes him in my opinion he best My husband and I felt like we constantly had to ask them for information and hope that we were asking the right questions He saw us a couple times when our regular doctor couldn't and he was what every patient hopes her doctor will be: professional, forthcoming with knowledge, patient and kind He explained everything I was going through in great detail and was always available via email to answer any questions that I had He has great bedside manner and is very knowledgeableDr Merhi is one of the most caring doctors that I have ever worked with He answered my million questions and always followed up to see if I was doing ok He was very honest with us Dr Liu patted my hand before the procedure and told me how sorry he was This solidified my desire to be a mother, as I was somewhat ambivalent about it before undergoing this whole processMy son turns 2 next week and he is the love of my life  Dr Zhang tailored my treatment and helped me understand that I didn't need a lot of injections and all you need is one golden egg, which I got and he's sleeping peacefully in his crib I felt like we were given a personalized program versus just being treated like a number (like at other clinics Dr Zhang actually had his hand on the doorknob as we were asking him questions I'm sure he's a busy man, but we were paying him for our care, and he was cold and inconsiderate  Additionally, Dr Zhang is in Castle Connoly Best Doctors and most important, his lab, embryologists and staff are top-notch I stayed with this clinic beacuse when I met Dr Zhang he honestly suggested me to do NOTHING, to NOT do any ivf or tentative because of my age! this is a very rare answer in these kind of clinics, since they want to make money out of tentatives, while in this case I found pure straightforward honesty I think the medical work done was very good and professional and we got a healthy baby They did a very good job with our case and I am sur with everybody, no matter if you get a child or notThe doctor did a great job of explaining how/why egg freezing works (he was extremely knowledgeable and polite), but when it came down to the actual procedure and process, I felt a little lost here) However, what was impressive is that they reached out when I expressed frustration, and genuinely seemed to care about my experience and how to make it better in the future  We almost gave up hope but our friend who also had success with the IVF at New Hope recommended this place to us  From my personal experience, I can tell that Dr Zhang doesn't try to push as many IVF procedures on patients as possible as claimed by others who commented earlier but rather recommends what he thinks is best for the patient given her current condition, i I went back in person  next day she was sitting at her desk looked at me and asked "" how can I help you"", really?! That was MsI feel like I wasted very valuable timeI saw Dr Zaher Merhi at New Hope and I just had a beautiful baby boy Dr Merhi is the most incredible, kind and supportive doctor around He has a wonderful sense of humor and really knows how to put patients at ease He is incredibly knowledgeable and compassionate Infertility is such a challenging journey and Dr Merhi was with us every step of the way, explaining every medication and procedure with such patience I can not thank him enough for giving us the most meaningful gift in the whole world Dr Zhang and his team were great and I had a wonderful experience at New Hope Dr Merhi and the entire staff were so attentive to our needs and listened carefully to every concern we had! They guided us every step of the way  When ever we had questions we felt comfortable asking Just to finish my story, Dr Zhang was very honest with us, he told me that the chances even through IVF was 5 -10 % for my age Thankfully I hired a fertility coach named Lin Weinberg who helped me find a better clinic amongst helping me increase my egg quality  I felt like I was in one of those terrible lectures where they try to sell you time share!  Dr Zhang said we would do a sonogram and a blood test and he would call me with a ""plan"" when the blood work came back  My husband had done some research online and found New Hope and their Mini IVF protocol, which was attractive to us as we were convinced that pumping me full of drugs was inhibiting our chances of success  The technology he is using is superb, the volume of patients in his office speaks louder than wordsIt took me a while to register on Yelp and write this review, as I want other women reading it to really give Dr Zhang a chance I also waited for my baby girl to turn 2 months!!! We were successful with New Hope at the 1st try and Dr Zhang was the first doctor to tell me that I am young enough and will have children, he really gave me hope  And New Hope is the MOST flexible in every respect, compared to all the other centers When I think of the way I was treated by staff (including billing) at NYU, I am amazed how everyone there passed the buck and were so much less engaged than the team at New Hope Even the sonographers at New Hope seem to me a hundred times more thorough than the actual Doctor Fellows at NYU (who often additionally appear disengaged & perfunctory) (But the NYU guy can come across as vain and competitive with peers; and perenially one gets the impression he's doing you a big favor to speak with you Patients have experienced Dr Noyes behaving like an absolute MONSTER    Overall I would say my experience was a positive one  It got the point where I told the office that I don't ever want to speak with him again and will only communicate with Dr Luk, who actually is amazingI believe the overall methodology that NH has embarked on is top notch and found Dr Zhang to be very knowledgeableMy experience so far has been very positive (he didn't) - i suspect he is a good doctor but just too overworked to pay attention to a patient",3.548076923076923
22,New Hope Fertility Center,Doctor,Negative,"After 7 years of going to my OBGYN feeling broken and helpless, being diagnosed with PCOS doing the timed intercourse, being given Clomid and Metformin, using OPKs, getting an HSG and being told that it would happen if I gave it time saying they could not physically ever find anything wrong with me I was finally referred to New Hope Fertility center After 5 IUIs at Weill Cornell, 3 IVF cycles at RMA NY (horrible horrible!) and then finally 2 rounds at NHFC, we are blessed with a beautiful baby girlThis was one of the worst doctor experiences I've ever had  We were told the prospect looked dismal, and we should think about donor eggs, surrogacy or adoptionAt the time of hopelessness, we came across New Hope and Dr Zhang Now that my cycle failed nurses advised that I meet with Dr Zhang for my next steps In spite of repeated calls and pleading that someone call me back about some time sensitive issues and questions its been silence from NHFC My husband and I had some difficulty during our process, as this is not a simple process to go through  No one ever sat down with me and went over a schedule Empty apologies and misinformation were all we received in our lengthy wait Any office - let alone a medical office - that manages itself in such a terrible, disorganized way instills very little confidence in what goes on beyond the waiting room But unfortunately I have not seen or heard from the man since my first consultation We never felt like a priority to them After the IVF failed, Dr Zhang didn't call, not even to encourage me to do a 2nd roundAfter trying several other NYC fertility clinics where we had very negative experiences, we finally went to New Hope I have never been treated so poorly by a medical professional  Messy treatment procedure  My wife was asked by the doctor to have her 4th IUI and they collected my specimen only to find they messed up my wife's ovation date and need to reschedule to two days later We had gone to several centers and were extremely disappointed  No other doctor took the time to do this; Dr Merhi listened when I voiced my concerns of the medications were affecting my body Therefore, presented here is a critique of their manuscript and of uncontrolled clinical use of LI-IVF, in general He seemed rushed and the billing department made numerous mistakes causing us a lot of un-needed hassle especially during a sensitive time My Hormone levels indicated some issues and my current/new RE is questioning them and wondering why no one - no Doctor at NHFC has brought this up with me and still went through with my first IUI (which was unsuccessful; as was the subsequent)PREPARE TO BE IGNORED BY NHFC!I never write reviews, but felt compelled to write one about this careless, useless & hopeless place!  DO NOT get suckered into going here for fertility treatment  Someone within this company NEEDS TO TAKE A SERIOUS  LOOK AT THE BILLING PROCESS AND PROCEDURES!!!We went through a crisis while we were being treated there and their response was negligent and appalling  My experience was horrendous  He avoided and skirted our questions when we him asked why we would do IVF when there was no clear diagnosis  Dr Zhang was the worst because he did not care to ever have a conversation  No kidding - after my last IVF failed, the nurses (not Dr Zhang) called to say, ""Come on in when your cycle starts so we can schedule your next IVF",3.548076923076923
23,New Hope Fertility Center,Doctor,Neutral," They sat down with me and my husband and spoke to us about what we've done and what we should do Finally, when my husband went up and spoke to someone after 2 hours we were taken in to see the doctor about the genetic results She then told me, ""oh, don't listen to her She then told me I was just ""uneducated,"" but said that they would still be able to perform this test today magically The doctor sat with us for 45 minutes to go over our history in detail and now I'm waiting to get help for my endometriosis which they think is the problem before we start fertility treatments5 hours of a full blown sales pitch), her immediate question was ""What should I put you down for? IVF treatments?"" For example, during the procedure, I did not get enough information​ so I needed to google every day​ to understand things Dr Jennifer Kulp-Makarav worked with me, she looked into every crack and crevasse she could and was patient with me Here I am 11 months later I'm finally pregnant, see my baby, and hear his heartbeat via ultrasound He also matter of fact and practicalThe treatment, interactions and relationship with both administrative and medical staff was stellar I called the office to speak with Dr Zhang so that he may explain results that I had receivedMonths later we received an inquiry about our lapse, and when we'd be resuming treatment There was a moment that I really needed to see a doc and ofcourse that didn't happen The physician never came when i had an appointment to see her Let me explain  We finally got to speak to our doctor That doctor did not know how my wife's reaction to clomid is  When I had questions about my bills, I just went to see any billing staff and got answers I thought she was a stranger not minding her own business My wife has had to wait over 2 hours on multiple occassions, even though she showed up on time for her appointment  I was still on birth control when they scheduled the START of my cycle and made my first appointment while I was in London He lent me one of the medications from the office until my order came in He's very very knowledgeable and assisted with every issue Dr Luk and Dr Zhang were always in a hurry to get out of the examining room, and were never forthcoming with informationDr Zhang's approach is very different from the rest of the reproductive endocrinologists  Dr Zhang and his staff are exceptional From Dr Zhang especially, there was only routine and coldness As we stood trying to get answers to our questions, he opened the door and left the room  Today, when I look at my two boys, the thought of a zero balance in that account means absolutely nothing  We first met with Dr Zhang who spent a lot of time slowing explaining to usHe is very professional and very busy I went in person spoke to 2 different people: one had to run for a ""meeting"" it was lunch time, second asked me to look into my account and call me back tomorrow Especially since Zhong got media attention He was so communicative and available for any questions and concerns we had and it made all the difference in the world to us He is a very patient doctor and customizes the treatment as per his patient's situation We had also worked with Dr Merhi previously and he remembered me as soon as I contacted him  Dr Merhi answered all our questions and spent endless time without rushing usWe saw Dr Zhang as our primary doctor We met with Dr Zhang once and then were ""handled"" by many members of young staff in their 20s with an attitude  We had a ""consultation"" appointment where Dr Zhang took about an hour of our time to try to up sell us an IVF  When I asked to speak to Dr Zhang, they told me I would need to make a phone consultation appointment, which of course, costs $150 I moved to Dr Zhang who is far more consultative and tailored in his approach to each patient  I have done every treatment imaginable  I met with his mentor at NYU who told me, ""Let's just say he is a business man""  This mentor has had many debates with Dr Zhang about some of his philosophies reminding him that many of them have zero medical evidenceand actually, the medical evidence points in the opposite direction of what Dr Zhang proposes  He NEVER responded to my email I was at RMA and the nurses sat down with me and told me everything, answered all of my questions and the doctor at RMA was available last week i asked to see or speak to Dr Zhang (who was already my doctor by the way) and Human Resources said it would take ONE MONTH",3.548076923076923
24,New Hope Fertility Center,Advice,Positive," I wish that I could stay here throughout my whole pregnancySo thankful that I made it to NHFC Please don't give up other prospective parents, it is not a matter of whether or not it will happen, it is WHEN it will happenAll I can tell any woman who is seeking the finest fertility care in NYC to only go here Every nurse, my wonderful and amazing Dr, Dr Makarov, make you feel that becoming a parent is not only possible but can be done treating your body in the best care possible They go out of their way to make sure you are clear on things and leave no room for doubt, question or confusion If you want to have an IVF experience that is not conventional but customized to your body only; this is your placeI am reposting my review with more clarity  If you freeze your eggs at New Hope Fertility and then want to go to another facility- your eggs will not be accepted   New hope fertility is disorganized- which is the last thing you would want while going thru fertility treatment  Your staff to your billing department are key to your success  Keeping accurate records of payment- these are all important You are just another number and more money   Please see the discourse I had with the billing managerWanted to write this review as I sit in the hospital in recovery Just know as a employee and patient at new hope fertility center I can relate and sympathize with you all! In any case I wouldn't recognize this clinic at all and if you have experience similar issues please reach out to me I would love to investigate further This is very long, but please read because I do not want this to happen to anyone else She didn't hear anything about history or even ask how often we were having sex (something that I think you'd probably want to start with)  It is definitely NOT individualized  I find it interesting that Cynthia B wrote a great review and she is an employee Again, there was no indication that she had any intention to better understand if fertility treatments are even needed  I would strongly caution anyone looking to start this journey with this practice Find a Dr that will use proper measures to come up with a non-invasive / cost effective treatment plan  When I speak to other people about infertility problems, I happily recommend NHFC If you do the monitoring early morning, then speaking to a doctor is awarded if you ask for it Good luck ladies, wishing you success, I'm with you on this hard journey!!! He listens​ to you and proposes​ the best option At that time, I learned​ that he is the doctor that really cares​ about patients​ About the NHFC, I believe it is a good clinic On the other hand, I also agree with other people​ that they can re-organize their structure a bit more I wish they explain better or enrich the website​ articles and forms Thank you so much and all the best to people who are​ considering​ to go to NHFC I don't know if the doctors know how much this team is hindering their profits but I hope they see it and figure it out soon Got 12 more embryos to go so you see they know what they're doing as far as process and most importantly I knew what they were doing each step of the way as well If I have any complaints, it would be the fact that they dont deliver the actual baby lol I dont want to trust anyone else with my miracle but them!!! I can not thank them all enough for the many blessings we have and are going to receive Best experience ever  I would recommend him to absolutely ANYONE looking to get pregnant Often to the point of missing the window of opportunity, You will not get the one on one attention you may have hoped forinstead it feels like a ""take it or leave it"" attitude that all the staff from top down seem to take So i'm very weary about recommending the clinic again Overall, if you are from the city, well informed and educated about the procedures you are being recommended, know your rights as a patient, know the code of conduct expected of a Clinic like this, and know how to hold parties accountable - then go for it And I am still waiting after I said I would like to talk to the doc first He has excellent bed side manners Especially, Dr Merhi's care was consistently kind, focused, informed, and of the highest medical caliber and indicative of extensive, specialized training and knowledge Overall, I highly recommend and if we decide for a second child we will be using them again Can you believe that? This clinic just cares to take your money! They don't care about you Save your time and stay away  And the literature clearly stating that if time is delay and it can negatively impact pregnancy outcome  ""I'm confident you will get pregnant within 6-12 months""Oh, boy, didn't we try hard to ""get ready"" - exercises, diets, emotional balance, herb medicine I wish that I had gotten better care "" False hope facility"" seem it will string you along if i didn't come to my sensesNHFC approach is that they could care less This is a place where you need to advocate for yourself and hope, as that's the best you will get  I only want to think happy thoughts If you want to learn more about our experience and what to ask, maybe that conversation will be invaluable to you  We wish you the best  In part of that journey, I wish your experience will be a good one  Especially if you are older like me and don't get many eggs thru conventional IVFs, I highly recommend NHFC If we plan on having more children, we definitely know we will return to NHFC, without a doubt You aren't allowed to speak to your doctor, you aren't seen by the main doctor or regularly by anyone who gets to know you Long story short the first visit he was amazing i couldn't be happier to start this process Well they only try to make you spend more money They only want your money I wish all of you good luck for this journey, try to listen more than one Doctor Choosing a doctor is as important as choosing a clinic I work with Dr Yang and I think he is the best This will save you from lots of anxiety If you see an instruction that looks off, communicate with your doctor to make sure dosage or time is right Your own wellbeing is as important as a future baby Stay happy and stay strongDoctor Kulp-Makarov is the best fertility doctor one could ask for She is patient, understanding, and kind She helps you stay hopeful even at the toughest of moments Most of all, she is very talented at what she does, and you couldn't ask for someone more effective and knowledgeable My doctor at new hope have me a different perspective I preferred Dr Liu as I found him to be more responsive and willing to discuss my questions/concerns However I know this is a outlet many may review when it comes to making this important decisionI would suggest you try your luck with some other place before deciding on this one He's the best! Unfortunately, he was kicked out of New Hope Fertility Center  It is in their interest that you have to do more than one cycle in this process, whether you are extending fertility or undergoing IVF to have a child - economically, they are not incentivized to produce a positive outcome on your first try  To ask a woman to invest financially, physically, medically, temporally in this process and not take all measures, let alone any measures to ensure the ideal outcome on her behalf is ENTIRELY UNETHICALI'm sure many women are hesitant to speak on this experience as it is a personal, private, medical process  I am not happy to be putting this experience on the internet, but I believe in this process and the importance of a woman's newfound ability to extend her fertility in the face of modern career and family challenges  Some interest in the women's experience and needs in this process is essential Highly recommend using NHFC if you are thinking of having children or are having difficulties We contacted New Hope in the hope of getting more information about if they could do anything about our caseOverall I would recommend New Hope to anyone we speak to about IVF in NY Go somewhere else if you want to be treated like a person Or if you really like superficial things and, like cucumber water, by all means, go here I would 100% refer Dr Merhi and the staff at New Hope to anyone struggling with infertility Dr Zhang gave realistic success rate analyzation, unlike other clinics would try to sell you a dreamIf you are considering purchasing donor eggs from New Hope, be sure you question them and the FDA about the status of their failed FDA inspection in 2014 If you are planning IVF, I highly recommend New Hope Facility! New Hope has been amazing, all thanks to Dr Zhang and his wonderful teamI'm still trying to give this place at chance Sometimes I really wonder if my success is their success For now, I m still hopeful and giving them a chance but to be honest I have started looking into other places just to have my options in the future If I only had to deal with them, I would give New Hope 5 stars I can understand that if you're a patient used to ""the drill"" that this hand holding may not be necessaryIf you do decide to try New Hope, the only doctor I would recommend is Dr Chang Dr Merhi is an excellent doctor I highly recommend New Hope! I can't recommend Dr Merhi more, he is wonderful! Plus New Hope has monitoring until 2pm which is super convenient And much more gentle and even natural But 100% worth it I will be forever grateful that I found them Try New Hope in NYC"" At New Hope, they will work with you to get as far as you can with whatever you have to work with Maybe this is why I had such a good experience I don't think it's fully because of getting paid, I think it's because they allow couples to follow the path they choose My emotions are running high right now, but I would still, unequivocally, recommend New Hope Fertility Center  He is consistently in the 95 percentile at all his check ups, considered advanced in his daycare and is very brightI don't know if they deliberately lied to us, or were just incompetent (I would hope the latter) but if you're planning to use insurance here - beware! You're shuffled from one station to the next like a piece of meat rather than a person In what is obviously a sensitive and emotional point in your life, you ought to be treated with care and compassion After four months with New Hope, my husband and I were trying to decide on next steps and understand what might be going on If you want compassionate, good care, do not go to New Hope  What he is going to do is:  1) be honest about your overall situation  If you are not a good candidate for IVF, he will let you know, but most likely will offer other options of achieving pregnancy; and, 2) he will fully review your history and put you on the best path possible to fulfill your dream of becoming a parent  Compare Dr Zhang's results to other clinics -- quite impressiveNo matter what route you decide to take, I wish everyone who reads my post and who is trying to achieve pregnancy the very best of luck if you are , like m, someone that wants to know, understand and decide, ask and insist to see the doctor, since you ar not going to see him much I saw someone wrote they are not sensible to what a woman wants or need, this may seem true, in the sense that theer is no space for emotionality or talking or venitng, it is a little robotic and just straitghforward but I prefer to be told the truth instaed of being given what I ask for when it is not going to work they wouldn't even allow you to speak with your doctor meaning you think you're a client of Dr Zhang but you're not if you have a question or a problemI went to New Hope after being rejected by two other doctorsI decided to try New Hope (NH) after a friend of mine mentioned about the place  I would highly recommend NH if you are looking for a more natural IVF procedure, at a much more affordable prices Maciej has a quiet rational that inspires trust I recommend New Hope Fertility Center without any hesitationsI enrolled in the study of mini-IVF at New Hope I really want to like NHFC If you do, here's what you can expect:You will be impressed by your first visit They will assure you of their ability & willingness to answer any of your questions & concerns You will be comforted by that You will wonder how you will be treated when you are actually fully under their care & have clinical questions or concernsI am not sure where my initial review went, however almost a year later I am still unable to officially take care of my billing issues  For some reason the billing continues to be inconsistent and the follow-up is minimal, and that's me putting it very nicely  At this point I have decided to request my records and seek care elsewhere  These other clinics I speak of understand how important communication and  a doctor patient relationship is  Save your time, money and heartache - steer clear of New Hope Fertility and Dr Zhang I am leaving again today with the hopes of finding a more professional place to spend $7,200 plus $1,200/year storage to freeze my eggsAs I write this review, I'm looking at my healthy baby boy, who wouldn't be here if it weren't for New HopeIf I tell you I know the business of IVF, this place is superior to any other IVF or fertility center in New York, among NYU, Columbia and others Don't get deceived by reviews that Dr Zheng is a money driven practitioner With his experience and knowledge, he is wiling to risk and takes patients that no-one else considers treatable, regardless of how it will affects his ""success"" statistics No one will guarantee you a 100% pregnancy, but I know this place will give you the best chance you have at getting it! Finally, I went to consult with Dr Zhang at New Hope Fertility Center Thank you New Hope Staff and Dr Zhang!  Is Zhang a businessman? Yes) Do Zhang's efforts to develop his own shop negate his far better bedside manner, willingness to listen to patients' preferences & their educated pushback on his recommendations, as well as his (and his team's) far more flexible, bespoke treatment of patients, compared to other shops? No way   New Hope also treats some of the toughest (oldest) cases In this respect, perhaps they're giving people False Hope instead of New Hope I wish all of you the best of luckI wanted to share my experience with New Hope Fertility Center  I also recommend to watch for your money""  They don't ask about whether stress is a factorMy next stop - the better business bureauI wish you all the best in your journey he made a fortune with cheating a good results as a promise of pregnancy is very helpful and responsive standard depending on your age and issue - don't just rely on them to tell you as there is conflicting reports about this out there  I hope this info helpsthe good thing about NH is that they don't turn anyone away",3.548076923076923
25,New Hope Fertility Center,Advice,Negative," It's your responsibility to inquire about the costs of things and to check your insurance to know what is your responsibility; not New Hope's Now that I am thinking about this horrible pushy experience where the doctors wants to make money more than you having a child, I am sure it was done on purpose"" Ok, that's terrifying She was trying to put pressure on the need to start treatments immediately/not waste time and categorized us as ""infertile"" with no warranted facts; she was trying to prey on a couple's fear and failed, miserably, but I can see many couple's trying for a much longer time and easily falling for this tactic  Not sure what the outcome will be, but I have never been more pleased with New HopeOther things is unhappy  If you are coming from outside NYC, spending your time and effort traveling, you will often find yourself frustrated because a lot of your questions, be it about the procedures, billing are simply going to go unanswered You have to be extremely well informed about the processes and be pesky and ask a lot of questions, unfortunately, to which you may or may not get all your answersYou will pay in your time, how frustrated their process and their way of conducting business will make you feel  What? Do I need IVF yet? No one has even spoken to me The facility is a waste of your time and money As a number, they don't care about whether you live or die or if you suffer- they only care about numbers and money Shame, shame, shame on you Dr Zhang Bc sadly they only want your money I have to say after speaking with her I could not have felt better about my decision to choose NHFCI am currently 10 weeks pregnant with Twins and couldn't be more happier !Thank you Dr Merhi and the New Hope staff! That went a long way with me in terms of dealing with the emotional disappointment It's frustrating talking to them trying to explain stuff about your schedule Again, not the best experience  There was no consideration of my travel schedule at all  You see below that this is the ready response to any of their failures  It was pure incompetence, or more likely, general disinterest in the patient's needs, but the response is to blame it on the woman and her body  If your cycle fails to produce your desired results, they will tell you it is because of your body  All of this excludes the points that can be made about false promises, unethical processes, undue stress If I could give negative stars for our experience here I would They pressure you into things you don't want and don't share useful options unless you know to ask It is a very serious matter to fail an FDA inspection and I would caution you before moving forward with their egg donor program to have all the facts straight from the FDA But sometimes, when I think about the things that annoy me about them, makes me think about what else could they be messing up with, missing or mishandling I can't say enough good things about him No matter what, infertility is stressful, though Dr Merhi did everything he could to make the process as smooth as possible If you are stressed about money, it definitely does not help you on your journey to becoming a parentIncompetent or possibly fraudulent insurance practices  He is not going to sit there and commiserate with you about past failures  When you decide to embark on this journey, you have to be prepared to fail as not everyone gets lucky right away  For the negative reviews you see here, my advice is this, go to the SART website (sart I even put a complaint while going there, since if you don't ask they don't give esplicationlet's say they follow you very accurately but you just have to obey and no many words are spentand if you don't like what they tell you  you got no recourseHorrific experience with this office  Anyone who has gone through fertility treatments knows that it is a stressful and emotional process However, this still doesn't merit going to New Hope if its other aspects are the worst Going to New Hope is my worst decision on my infertility journey)  As the critics say, it seems reasonable to enroll in a trial where they give mini-IVF for free, but there's no reason to pay for possibly ineffective treatment I do not recommend this clinic It's not very reassuring, and after spending almost 10k with no feedback, (clearly if IUI isn't working after 3xs and getting no feedback and oddball hormone levels, there's some serious situations falling through the cracks) I don't think I will return here You will have a question or two or three, now that you've had time to digest the limited information they gave you If you were treated anywhere else before now,you will be disappointed at the lack of info in comparison to your last RE You will leave a message Your email will be ignored  You will go online & you will post a scathing review of this incompetent group and you will warn others not to waste their precious time here!!You will hope that sharing your horrible experience will help at least one person!!!  If you are on the fence about going here, run far away, in the direction of a fertility clinic that backs up its promises and won't treat you like you don't exist! Now it's a week, and NO email or explanation about anythingUnfortunately, all the negative reviews are correct   His salesmanship was poor   There ARE other places in this vicinity that will give you a serious consultation and listen take all of your concerns Called her again, was unprofessional with little information about cost, the procedure or anything  Perhaps those in charge have become more concerned about their image after receiving some negative reviews, but I am mystified by those negative reviews here One negative reviewer mentioned Dr Zhang's mentor at NYUI even wrote to Dr Zhang complaining about the ridiculous wait times and disorganization of the office  What I have found is fertility doctors are trained to do this: figure out why you are not able to get pregnant, pump you with meds and try to get you to do an IUI or IVF until you finally say ""no more he will slowly suck your blood from you until your money running out and you will get nothingthe bad thing about NH is that they don't turn anyone away  in addition,  the Human Resources dept doesn't address any of your concerns and deliberately avoids you",3.548076923076923
26,New Hope Fertility Center,Advice,Neutral," I never left not knowing what was happening Then comes COVID-19 I'm currently 10 weeks and have just graduated and will now be seeing a OBGYN and am pretty sad Do give NHFC a try  This whole experience is turning into a nightmare I am a doctor and fully understand how a clinic should be run A baby I thought I would never be able to carry or hold myself Just early this year me and my husband were discussing adoption or fostering a child/babyshe doesn't know what she's talking about Then suddenly, they let me know that they actually would be able to start fertility treatments the following day Towards the end of the session (after 1 A couple of week's later I got a notice from her office to see when I can start a cycleIf you're trying to get pregnant you're familiar with the things you need to look into: the health of your uterus, your fallopian tubes, and your hormone distributionThey are explaining is never enough what's going on and what's the plan They asked me to do the blood test and ultrasound before even talk to the doctor I can't wait to be a mumDr Merhi, is a very skilled, knowledgable and attentive doctor  I did this a few times- never understanding what I was doing or receiving any follow up The analogy he used was that you need to have a fertile ground first before you implant seeds  But something needs to change as its dangerous and suboptimal in delivery of care The doctor does not follow your case the nurses are the one sending email saying what the doctor is sayingFind ANY place else  We could not get our doctor to speak to us Asked to speak to the doctor If you are getting good bad indifferent results, please PM meDo not go here if it is your first time seeking treatment They will not explain anything to you, respond to your inquiries, and zero personal attention My experience has been incredible despite the circumstances and will be back in Dr Merhi's office as soon as I return Furthermore, he is a very experienced surgeon He conducts procedure himself for his own patients I will tell you that many of his patients would rather skip a cycle when he is on vacation Also, ask your doctor which method of communication he or she prefers Try to find a few IVF partners at the wait room Consult your family doctor for a second opinion if you have an abnormal blood result or a test run and a report is available Positive thinking! It's not an easy journey so treat yourself once in a while If this is how you handle your customer service, you will not be able to get new customer Other places won't do this and will push you to donor) Also, unlike Weill Cornell, you don't have one nurse assigned to you  So that you can make an informed decision: My experience was not IVF  You see the difference in competency Stay away from this clinic You will never see Dr Zhang again after your first initial appointment Take heed of this and ask the right questionsEveryone's experience is deeply personal when it comes to fertility There was never any follow up after a procedure from the doctors, not even an email For a first-time IVF-er, though, I expected more walking through each step and explanations throughout the processAs you read this, you may be thinking that I have a lot of money  Not the case Thak you Dr Zang andto th all stuffHis back office, specifically accounting/billing is the opposite You can never call and speak to a person After, don't expect anything Not even a nurse meets with you They look at the sonogram and don't have any knowledge of the history I think this place has become a factory There weren't public reviews back then so I'm writing this that people are able to make an educated choice They'll set you up with your initial consultation very quickly It feels rushed But you are wiling to do whatever it takesYou will be sent home with some information but lots of questionsYou will go home You will send an email You will email the billing department You will call and email again More time will pass You will not hear from them They will rush you in, push you into treatments that don't make sense, and bring you back as often as possible in order to continue to charge you each month  She is a nurse and Dr Zhang is a doctor  Dr Zheng will offer you adjustments and options based on your results and attitude, unlike other places Or test all your hormone levels each time they monitor  But there were many misconceptions in the previous reviews  I will keep you guys posted about my experience  My next appointment is in 2 weeks  Bottom line - Dr Zhang is a money hungry doctor  After 6 weeks, he finally decided to have a conversation with me  Have all of your questions when you come and grab the nurses then and maybe, possibly, you might have a minute with the doctor or they can check with the doctor and get back to you  Tell the nurse  Do diligent research about mini ivf vs then they are unavailable to meet or speak with you Do NOT go there",3.548076923076923
27,New Hope Fertility Center,Nurse,Positive," I told her that the nurse asked what day of my cycle I would be on and said it was fine for me to come She was always available and the visits were quick, clear and concise with instruction as to what course of action she was taking  The nurses are wonderful and responsive as is the prescription coordinator The overall experience was always very informative, pleasant and helpful But when I called she was not only rude but refused to even take a message for ZhangWe had a great experience at New Hope The communication at NHFC is awesome as most communication is done through a confidential email system, with respect to scheduling follow up appointments and in providing test results The staff truly works as a team to address patients Most of my complaints with NH is regarding their nurse communications We all need emotional support! 4  Women, mothers deserve betterI had a very positive experience with egg freezing at New HopeBilling is hard to reach  other then that i love the place Dr yang is amazing very sweet staff over the phone very helpful i fogot her name but she was so nice when booking my first appointment i loved it They work very efficient,fast with my insuance the nurses are very helful by email and by phone i highly reomend this place These types of accommodations make me feel like they care about my success :))))I have been with New Hope since September 2016 and my husband and I are thrilled to find out the good news with just 1 cycle via the ""Mini-IVF"" plan They have been very helpful and most importantly they take all your concerns in a timely manner! They either call you immediately or send you emails to explain the plans in details  Out of all the places we've been they are very responsive to questions and provided feedback in a very timely fashionNew Hope was a great experience for me I found communicating with the nurses via email the easiest way to get answers to my questions Zhang and Yang, and, of course, the wonderful staff at New Hope Fertility   Sincerely, Lynne Walrod  When we finally reached out to Nurse Lisa, whom we had the pleasure to getting help from at another center and she guided us to Dr Merhi at New Hope We truly believe it was all due to Dr Merhi, Nurse Lisa and everyone at New Hope! New Hope Center is truly about helping you conceive We will forever be grateful to Dr Merhi, Nurse Lisa and the entire staff at New Hope!! She said she had tried other places and NH was by far the least impersonal, and the most efficient placeAt NH, yes it is like a factory, but they are so much more efficient (from signing up electronically to communicating via secured email with nurses to getting all your results via email) Our experience with them was awesome All their staff is very professional and friendly, in particular Tania and Maciej Unfortunately I think that they have alot of work to do to garner more stars than the 2 I generously give now She had an attitude with me, but promised to adjust my account and send me an email with all the corrected information I've experienced the opposite at New Hope: a staff of dedicated Nurses, good med-techs, and YES doctors -- who care MORE & take the time The entire support staff is the most skilled and most broadly & specifically knowledgeable in the entire fertility process (not just cogs in a wheel) than all of the fertility staff in places I've been to in NYC And good luck avoiding Dr Nicole Noyes on the days when she's in charge",3.548076923076923
28,New Hope Fertility Center,Nurse,Negative,"Poor Customer Service!!! After calling this office and speaking to the receptionist who then transferred my call to a Justine RI didn't realize she worked there because her id was hidden but she introduced herself as the Director of Marketing, JaclynI emailed them few times to inquire about something, no responses There was this one girl who had such a heavy Chinese accent I had to ask her repeatedly what she said, and then she gets angry  None of the information I needed to have a successful cycle was provided The intake nurse hugged me and told me this was the worst part of her Job9 calls out of 10 would have no response and rest of one call would transfer me over to other office and then beeps come out then I leave my voice msg and no response ever again There is NO communication at all",3.548076923076923
29,New Hope Fertility Center,Nurse,Neutral," The phlebotomist, the nurses and Dr Makarov were always incredible, and very informative Dr Makarov, Katherine, Daisy, Oksana, Joanna, Wei, Katie and sooo many more I could not believe how involved she became and how quickly she took action  These are real numbers very few words and just obeying instructions Nurse Lisa answered all our questions about the medications and always was available when we reached out Tania went above and beyond the call of duty to answer any questions that we had and guide us along this journey, she is invaluable After a lot of messages, I finally got the billing supervisor on the phone  She told us to simply come back another day  There names were Diane and JustineCalled them , spoke to one Ms Corey, she transferred my call to another voice mail",3.548076923076923
30,New Hope Fertility Center,Clinic,Positive," When I first got to New hope I was impressed by the facility It was clean and the staff was friendly The most impressive thing was how thorough they were I thought it was all over but the clinic stays open and checks our temperature at the door, has a nurse pumping hand sanitizer into our hands, the whole staff began wearing face masks and shields, the seats are separated for social distancing Needless to say I felt safe Thank you everyone at New Hope!! You're angels and I'll always appreciate you all The aquarium in the waiting area is so soothing! They understand how fragile and delicate this process is and take extreme care of you from beginning to end From the first day we arrived at the center, my husband and I KNEW we made the best choice possible Did I mention how kind everyone here is?!? It's somewhat surreal I read some of the reviews of others who gave them a 1 Star review and I'm like how?! Why?! Nothing is perfect, but New Hope is perfect for me; the same day NYC officially re-opened and I think it's quite cool to tell my future kids about the day they were conceived The procedure was pain free thanks to a wonderful  anesthesiologist and the pain afterwards was tolerable Also, I'm 39 & went through the Mini-IVF treatment which no one else in the city is capable of providing you with such a treatment besides the experts at New Hope Fertility I liked the center's philosophy on trying to get quality ovums and blastocysts over quantity to better your chances But it turns out that I got pregnant on the first try! The staff, including all the nurses, are very nice and accommodating, and the office hours are such that you can come in at various hours making it convenient if you work long hours like I doBut I am giving 5 stars because the most important thing here is getting pregnant, and they helped me have a baby I am not only an employee for the last 6 years but also a patient at New Hope Fertility and I wanted to share my story Not only can I relate but I can sympathize with everyone who is also a patient at New Hope Fertility Center She's breathing and eating on here own at 5 lbs 15oz and 20 inches long and have her grand entrance at 35 weeks All the staff at New Hope was extremely helpful and efficient throughout my process and I do not only say that because I am an employee I say it as a patient This process in itself can be extremely stressful and draining so a big thanks to everyone involved for making it easier for me even while working and shedding my tears I am now  in another fertility clinic in Oradell and it is night and day!!! Also after doing research on New Hope, the way they are handling their business is definitely borderline Cannot say enough horrible things about this place I had asked several people while I waiting to make sure they knew the reason we were there and that we were told to come in before the genetic test reading Clearly protecting their staff and patients and contributing to the safety of the general public is NOT part of their MO  Half of the staff there are nice and courteous and helpful  The only part of their staff that is functional, nice, and efficient is their phlebotomists--very professional as a whole and well-trained  And there are several ""great"" reviews by people who have not written any other reviews (hmmm, could they be biased employees? who have faked an account to sing glories about their place of employment?)  Never had the latter done, but the nurse explained everything about the process as well as what I was seeing on the screen  I then thought, maybe they're nice because it's the first visit He seems to look at my case individually, not just following the same protocol for all, which is what I find to be the case for most clinics, where they treat you like a number, or kettle, no reasoning in mind Their clinic is very pleasant with large windows to Columbus Circle and part of Central Park, and natural light is always welcome while going through hard times Their system is very efficient as well, which allows for their high demand to not leave us lost in the midst of infertility fogAll thanks to Dr Merhi and NHFC staff, I got a beautiful healthy​ baby girl at the ​age of 39 ​They have​ a great facility​, skilled staff and method​​ to perform a ​ton of success cases They generally work very quick and efficient They just charge​d from my credit card  I hope the ​billing department sends​ receipt​​ every time​ they use my filed credit card I've had a (mostly) good experience with them I've had to tell them that certain things don't work with the protocol they've given me These guys don't seem to be very good at their job (not submitting to insurance for long periods of time, sending surprise bills a year later) nor are they friendly or responsive If they make a mistake, they will still treat you like the jerk They have zero-ed out charges on my account, and I appreciate that they rectified this mistakeReally lovely people and compassionate team of medical professionals I mentioned them often and frequently to friends  UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE!!!!The twins are 15 months old and a complete joy!!! I can not express enough how overjoyed we are!! If I had to do it all over again I wouldn't change a thing  The staff is so kind and caring - the front desk remembers my name when I come in even though they are looking at hundreds of faces each day  Special shout out to the PAs who draw my blood every day because I am NOT an easy stick, and they never lose their patience or hesitate to ask a colleague for assistance if needed  The sonogram technicians are all so sweet and patient with all my questions I did recommend a few friends and family to the clinic hoping for success that I have had atleast with the procedure, but warning them that the treatment from staff from top down will feel a bit off Wish me luck!The clinic is like all New York clinics They could be more compassionate and treat you less like a number Both the doctor and staff were organized, knowledgeable and professional in all aspects of the care and specific treatments involved, and made me feel at ease and encouraged to ask any questions/make personalized requestsI just wanna say thank you  to NHFC I've never been pregnant in my life I'm 31 years old until now and I've tried! I'm currently 2 1/2 months pregnant  & I still can't believe this! Yes like every establishment they have there flaws but the clinic itself was worth every penny I spent!! They were very attentive to what I wanted to do! I made sure I stayed on top of them because this is something I really wanted the same way when it comes to wanting a job!! The place is clean, they provide snacks for you while you wait! I highly recommend this place if your having issues getting pregnant! It's not a easy process but the reward at the end is well worth the fight! Thank you Dr MerhiOne star for the very nice nurses  I appreciated the monitoring once we found out we were pregnant to make sure things were progressing as they should  It put me at ease during those early weeks when anything could happenWhile it's wonderful that they offer more affordable fertility treatments, as compared to most other fertility clinics in the metropolitan area, they literally have no customer service The nurses are good at what they do but they are not prepared to handle issues with customer serviceThe place is very efficient and run like a factory, which is probably how they keep costs down, but also results in very impersonal treatment If New Hope had a couple of people to actually support patients I think it would make a world of difference, but they don't seem to consider that with their current business model Guess they put more value in saving the money they might invest in customer support Considering how much they must make, I think this shows a real lack of care in their patientsSTAY AWAY!!! RUN RUN RUN!!!New Hope Fertility Center should be called ""NO hope"" The doctors are not knowledgeable and I had many failed cycles because they use inappropriate protocols and even cannot do the trigger timing correctly The success of getting blast for embryos can be significantly lower in busier seasons, such as summer We had all sorts of tests, results were not bad but not great either In the end, lo and behold, I successfully had 2 beautiful babies although the pregnancy process was somewhat eventful with bleeding scares, kidney trouble, and bedridden orderGreat facility and I have had a good experience with the staff and care in my IVF journey You are just a number your care is not customize for youGreat overall fertility center! Huge staff thats always willing to help The sonogrophers and nurses are particularly knowledgeable which was great when coming for ultrasounds in the morning The Billing department are vigilant in chasing you for your invoices I only wish the doctor would be as wellYou feel like an assembly line and the waiting room is like being at the DMV literally waiting for your name and number to be calledMost disappointing of all, is they sell you on ""Hope"" when realistically the stats and numbers they come to slowly reveal are a little less hopeful and more realistic You are a number in their factoryI was treated at a big fertility clinic in NJ before going to New Hope The entire team at NHFC is extremely professional and helpful The medical facility is well organized and the doctors have a forward thinking mindset in their research and expertise They are always working to make new breakthroughs to better help patients I can't emphasize enough how much they are patient-centered and have great bedside manners, which was very important to me It was a bonus that they have early morning hours, starting at 7 am, and are open 7 days a week This made it easy to work appointments around my work schedule, and not have to take so much time off I am sad about not visiting New Hope since I have graduated from their care, but I feel I left with all the knowledge I need to help me through this next phase of my pregnancy I give 2 starts Bc the place is clean and beautiful and the nurses were always super friendly and super kind Whatever the case, thank you to everyone who works there Another set of eyes always help Good luck! the only time they will respond to your question is during monitoring when they first email you the result and than you reply to their email with a question like on the medication quantityNew hope is a very special place Big thanks to the staff and vision at NHFC Amazing to have someone thinking outside the box!Very efficient staff and clinicThe place seems very modern and nice and all that, but the people working there are not the nicest bunchThe response you see from New Hope representatives is a perfect example of the misleading practices at this clinic  I have a number of friends who underwent this process at this clinic and their retrieval rates sit at 40 % among them Both days, we experienced incompetence and front desk mismanagement at their greatest I know of friends who visit other fertility clinics for the same procedure as my wife and I, and have a great experience My review here is not intended to reflect poorly on the doctors and medical staff who do so many good things for so many families It's always immaculately clean and I loved the aromatherapy scent in the air We found the surroundings very nice, from the tea and coffee in the reception to all the examination/procedure rooms, it all felt very new and clean and much better than we experienced in the previous clinic The staff was all very nice and the system works well, it opens early which was good for our work schedule as well as being flexible when needed Finally, I felt for the cost side it was also reasonable, the ""softer"" and less aggressive approach was easier on the pocket from a medication point and the capped cost of visits per month meant you wasn't afraid to come in if you were worried or wanted/needed to see a nurse and fear being charged too much the cost system was very easy without the hidden fears  The feeling I got from my month at New Hope was that they want to administer IVF to as many patients as possible and to generally do as much medically as possible whether its needed or not  I did have a positive experience with the lab techs and nursesI had never wrote reviews on yelp, but looking at my beautiful angel's face, Im so thankful and grateful, I have to give NHFC the credits The first transfer in June 2016 took, and now I have a precious baby boy who turned 8 weeks today! There were a lot of frustrations with the receptionists and the insurance coordinator when I needed them to call in for meds coverage, and that was the most stressful part at NH But the nurses and lab Dept are very helpful and quick in responding emailsI would like to say that I had a great experience with NHF I have been with them for 1 year and Thanks all Doctors, nurses, medical assistants, and front desk who help me go through this stressful process Other than that it was a wonderful experiencec…Other than this, the billing department at New Hope is a complete nightmareMy understanding is that New Hope used to be great many years ago when the doctors would actually examine and monitor the patients Now you are only monitored by nurses and in my opinion that is a big no-no There is absolutely nothing to complain about the services from the front desk, billing department, nurses and doctors that I have encountered I have been to two other facilities prior to New Hope and all I received from them was WAIT and hope they will call me backThe facility at New Hope is clean They have an efficient system which makes the wait time relatively short I feel so relaxed when I am there! Enough saidMy husband and I have been to a number of fertility clinics trying to conceive and finally at the first try at New hope we are expecting our little girl in a couple of weeks  New hope is a very professional clinic with very respectable nurses and staff  While it was a rocky road from beginning to end we finally were blessed with a successful pregnancy The clinic is clean, organized, and as relaxing as a fertility clinic could be Just one word of advice, they get many clients so it helps to be on top of your own baby ""game"" For the most part, all the nurses are  very nice and so are the doctors when you actually with them When I call in to speak to a nurse, the receptionist will take my name and phone number, and I will get a call back near the end of the day, which in my opinion is not right It seems like they don't have a system to properly file faxes as they come in I called them and I brought it to their attention and they agreed I was right Till today, they have not owned up to their mistake and apologized to us As a matter of fact they have corrected themselves and are making me believe that I was the one who misunderstood them! How could 2 grown up adults(my husband and I) have heard the same thing from 3 different people who now they claimed did not say!!!I feel like they like to bill my insurance for whatever they possible can They considered a ""3 sentence from a doctor who is talking to me in the hallway outside their sonogram rooms"", this to them is a doctor's consultation!Unfortunately I'm not knowledgeable enough to know if they are messing up with actual important stuff which is the success of the procedure I am just an obedient patient who does whatever they tell me and hope for the best Excuse my ignorance, but I thought that everything is time sensitive, at least that's how they make it feel like, so if my appt for a procedure is at 11 am and I don't get into the room until 2 hours later, Is this normal? One time were sitting in the waiting room for so long that even the receptionist came up to us to ask what are we waiting forHowever , I went to the office and worked it all out - just a reminder to anyone having billing issues go in person - much faster and easier One star for the nurses and one for the embryologists, who were the only people at New Hope who would email me back whenever I had a question and who were helpful and pleasant during my visits For an event that is so emotional, stressful and costly, I expected to be treated more like a patient and less like cattle Yes there can be long wait times Good luck everyone Yes, someone at another clinic actually told us, ""This place will never help you It is factory-like there at times, but super efficient This past Wednesday, I had a D&C at New Hope These small touches really helped me get through it I considered for a moment changing clinics again since we are out of state, but honestly, why would I leave New Hope? They helped me achieve something I thought would be impossible, even if it didn't result in a baby  They have the best lab in the business and I would highly recommend them to anyone hoping to become a Mother Aside from knowledgeable doctors, technologists and other employees there, the office is huge and well maintainedGiving this place 1 star is actually one too manyHIGHLY DISGUSTED!!!! (close this place down, do everyone a favor!)- oh I will be sharing this on FB so all of my same sex couples read about this place! I saw Dr Zhang for an initial  consultation on August 25th, both prior and during this appointment their office confirmed that they accepted my insurance and listed New Hope as a participating provider on my paperwork Our entire experience was great) Everyone we dealt with was very caring And most importantly we were finally successful! We had beautiful twins in April I would highly recommend New Hope While the facilities are clean and modern, the nurses and doctors don't treat people with any humanity New Hope treats its patients as walking paychecks Even when trying to be friendly, I only received terse answers and little kindness You certainly won't find it here Try pretty much any other clinicI had a great great experience with dr Zhang and all the staff Prior to coming to New Hope, I spent thousands of dollars at another clinic (Neway Fertility) with no results, and went on many initial consults with various other clinics Bottom line is that I have been trying to get pregnant for many years before I came to New Hope and I got pregnant and had a healthy baby boy thanks to New Hope  I have reviewed New Hope before, but I am here to review it again for the second time, as I have had my second child -- first, by the grace of God and then, by being in the hands of Drs   We loved the Columbus Circle facility- spacious, clean and amazing fish tank!  We were impressed with the doctors, nurses and staff and would highly recommend New Hope Fertility Center to any parent looking to seek professional, caring fertility treatmentthey should definitely get better in customer care, communication and tact, but  if you understand that and go around that and take the good things, you may be happy and have a good job done on you As per billling and pricceing, I think they are honest and not expensive, they just charge you per step and thy are honest in avoiding you useless steps if it is not the case, wihtout using sweet words sometimes, just tlling you on the face Good luck to everybody The Center is a large facility that handles many different aspects of fertility; the doctors/nurses are all well-versed pro's at fertility and can probably do many procedures in their sleep on autopilot, but I needed a little more hand-holding and information on what was actually going onI am very impressed by the level of service quality provided at New Hope  And I am glad that New Hope didn't insist I had to repeat all those tests again like other places would have required (In my opinion, it wouldn't change the fact but only costs me extra money)  The service is phenomenon and very efficient  I work in the city, and I got in to New Hope at 7am and back to work before 8:30am in downtown, so the schedule works perfectly given how often you have to go back for the routine monitoring They make millions but don't have more than one doctor on week ends? It's a joke It feels like a farm - you come in, your name appears, sees someone (not even a nurse) in 30 seconds and you are done To make it worse, the last straw that broke our hope with ""New Hope"" was they asked my wife to use an injection that's not covered by insurance without any prior discussion of the necessity or reason why it's not covered or our consent based on our financial condition  I will strongly recommend not to use their serviceFeel like a very small, tiny Chinese restaurant with one employee takes million orders I have filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and I'm considering suing them I don't understand how people can be so cruel to patients BEWARE of this place, and if you have the means do yourself a favor and go to a reputable clinic attached to a proper medical center  As soon as we enter the center we knew we were at the right place and we literally said we have ""new hope""  I never felt as calm as I did at New Hope  Everyone from the front desk, to the nurse and finance department are so caring and welcoming None would ever compare to New Hope and the wonderful staffMy husband and I are immensely grateful to the doctors, nurses and administrative staff at NHFC! Dealing with infertility is an intensely draining and bewildering experience We really appreciated the clarity and efficiency of the New Hope system (the waiting room, with its WiFi, big windows overlooking Columbus Circle, soothing aquarium, and screens telling you where to go when your name is called during monitoring hours is an especially welcome change from other practices), as well as the friendliness and compassion of all of the staff More than anything, we are thrilled to have achieved a healthy pregnancy and to have welcomed a beautiful baby girl! I recommend them without hesitation First of all, their monitoring hours are until 2:00pm, which is a huge relieve if you work  Second, I felt all the staffs to be warm and cordial This sounds like a small issue, but when you are in taking hormones and the level of anxiety is high, a nice word or a nice gesture makes a whole differenceIn 2013 my husband and I joined the New Hope Fertility Center IVF trial Additionally, the center has top notch equipment and great installations Plus, being in New York we had lots of fun there when we had to travel for the treatment One star is to its embryology lab, which is top notchI don't think a billing department like New Hope's can be any worse They agreed to review my bill on the call, but then I continue getting bills from them and was then never able to get a hold of them I then wrote a complaint to Better Business Bureau and even them were not able to get in contact with New Hope  Turns out that they have published only 1 study on mini-IVF before, and they have funding to test whether mini-IVF works as well as regular IVF in a new group of patients  I was surprised to read that at the same time that they are studying whether mini-IVF works --- and it might, who knows? --- they are taking people's money to treat them with mini-IVF  The materials on their website say that mini-IVF works as well as regular IVF, and yet there really isn't evidence for that, something that they have been called out for in the medical literature (Gleicher N, Weghofer A, Barad DH This was extremely stressful and required quite a bit of energy to resolve There are many other clinics where you can find success The 2nd issue is that NHFC no longer takes my insurance, so I have been paying out of pocket - and of course it's insanely expensive; exceptionally more expensive than my new center, and if there are hormonal issues, isn't it a moot point to go through with an IUI? Or are you just doing it so you can charge me for it willy nilly?  I really like the staff: nurses, front desk, bloodwork - but in 8 months, I have only seen Dr Zhang once for an initial consultation, and then some random doctors who performed the IUI - in & out (literally - haha) And no followup except via nurses, a quick call, or email Their systems are efficient; somewhat cattle call-ish, as they move you through fast and thoroughly, but their lack of personal interaction or empathy and care and individualized attention is disconcerting I'm a pretty independent, low maintenance, easy going person, and even I feel that there could be alot more individualized attention to patients aside from a ""patient liason"" I observe wandering around sometimes They will be very nice to you, but it won't seem genuine You'll be escorted throughout the office to have an ultrasound, blood work, meet with the doctor, who will recommend mini-IVF and PGD You are sure you've finally found the right place!  An answer to your prayers You will call New Hope and get to a voicemail box for the nurses  Just as I thought the billing process was beginning to work itself out, we have taken 10 steps backward away from progress Even my INS advised me to look for a clinic with better financial  communicationNew Hope likes to advertise that they have helped women over 45 with IVF We would recommend using CHR in New York if you like personal attention and a friendly staffI have tried to come twice for a consultation on freezing my eggs--each time, I was early for my appointment time and each time, I waited over an hour to be seen, giving up at about 1 1/2 hours to get back to businessI had a very positive experience at New Hope Fertility Center that culminated in a successful and healthy pregnancy The practice is very busy so there are times where patients may need to follow up aggressively and the nature of fertility treatment does require patience and managing expectations but overall I found the staff and quality of care to be excellent Although you may experience issues, they are truly interested in improving their business, based on complaints and feedback If you are deciding on fertility clinic, my advice is this is number one placeI can honestly say New Hope Fertility is God-sent fertility center I am so grateful that I found this clinic You don't see him often after your first appointment, but who cares, they have an amazing staff of nurses The billing team can be all over the place, but I will take it any day if this clinic gave me the most precious gift of life, my baby girl!!! I am also giving reviews of all doctors I have visited before finding New Hope in the last 2 years, as I want for somebody out there to also feel a joy of motherhoodWhere can I start after 15 years of infertility, new hope was able to give me a blessing, they was patient and kind, caring and professional , I would always wear glitter and they even gave me nickname tinkerbell I highly recommend them to assist with your fertility needs , they are miracle makers and I am forever indebted to them for my blessing I have had quite a positive experience at New Hope  (Though at least Cornell's billing staff was helpful I've never had consistently better blood draws than at New Hope The record-keeping at NYU is a JOKE compared to New Hope After charging $10,000 just to walk through NYU's door, most everyone at NYU condescends and they're not interested in gathering data to help learn for the next cycle Personally, I hope they never get too big, because it's the titanic clinics that serve themselves more than patients and can't easily shift their course due to their larger size  I have to admit I was a little cautious after reading other comments here on Yelp The receptionist was smiling and very knowledgeable  Everyone was helpful and accommodating  Overall I would say it was a very pleasant experience  But they were MORE than happy to have me come in again and take my money  For the premium they charge to their peers, I would have expected superior customer service- what received was subpar  I've been in for three appointments, and have been impressed with how organized the whole process has been  Maybe they are paying attention to their Yelp reviews?   I will update this review if my experience changes - but so far, the service and efficiency here has been really very good The nurses have been very helpful too Pro and Con -they do a lot of monitoring which is good for precision, but after one iui and having my baseline, I didn't feel the need to come back on day 3, 8, 11 for insemination like they wanted, I came on day 11 and went from there Staff is friendly but you have to hunt them down  Don't rely on the front desk staff to get important info across (although they are nice) i give one star for the sweet front desk and the embryology dept which is great",3.548076923076923
31,New Hope Fertility Center,Clinic,Negative," New Hope gave me the one thing I personally couldn't give myself so it's well worth it and a small problem to haveMy only issue with the place would be that the billing department doles out information in a confusing manner sometimes  Reputable centers will not take the eggs !  Please see attached email photos I was just so tired of the constant disappointment and the multiple losses I had suffered in the last 10 years She apologized about the confusion and said that the test would be performed right away When I went into the testing room, I told the doctor I was scared because I heard this may hurt They made an already vulnerable situation way worse I hate that I had to go through such an awful, degrading experience, however it lead us to Kofinas so it was a blessing in disguise  It is poorly run and impersonal  The other half hate their jobs and take it out on the patients There was this one ultrasound tech who was rude, sullen, and dismissive for days until one of her colleagues had to apologize to me saying she was ""having a bad week  Though I was very wary of coming here due to the negative comments, I decided to try it anyway because of their ""quality vs A minor problem was I unless I ask for the ​receipt​, the billing department never sent them to me I do have to say that their major weakness They will outright ignore you - emails, phone calls, messages from the front desk etcUpdate: NHFC came back to me and said it was an error by their outsourced billing companyThat being said, would be hesitant to come back for the actual procedure since I hate being surprised by unexpected bills/charges!Revised from 1 star to 3 for customer remediation I was hopeless and this was my 3rd fertility center, the other 2 my husband fired, but not before a few thousand dollars were spent in vain Look, in a nutshell this is a one stop shop, and if you want to find out what's going on AND get pregnant this is the place They don't care patients Their accounts of severe lack of communication, billing irregularities, failing to find anyone to take up their issues to or treat them fairly as a customer, is worse than what i experienced and expected  You will find that the price is often time less than what you may pay at the IVF clinics in other parts of the country for similar procedures however, you will pay in terms of how little communications and explanations you will the scheduling, nursing staff, and doctorsThe only downside for me is the billing department of the clinic who did not want to disclose her last name for obvious reasons was extremely rude, unprofessional and argumentative with me  I had an appointment with one doctor, who canceled on me and was rescheduled with a new doctor  After taking time off work and sitting in the waiting room for long past my appointment time, I was told that my new doctor was canceling and would call me that evening  I finally burned out on the awful feeling of not even being a human or having a name to these people and I stopped going  I was so scared off - it took me almost a year to summon the energy to try to find another clinic and go through it again We responded that we had informed them we had decided to stop treatment and voiced our issues with the fact that they never seemed to check their records, or simply failed to record it It's unfortunate I have seen many patients with messed up cycles because of doctors' mistakes Their lab is well-known to be unstable and bad quality Why? Save cost! You have no idea how your embryos died in their lab Don't believe their good success rate on SART!!! It is tricky! I heard patients like me who never get a chance to transfer an embryos won't be counted as data points for SARTI just tried for baby #2 and had a very disappointing experience  Maybe provide a chaperone?  Or stress the importance of having someone there to take them home after the procedure Hours past no one called me to see if i went to restroom or to see even if I leftNo one calls you back no matter WHERE you are in your journey/treatment No one does what they say they are going to do (ie call you back, process insurance, call the pharmacy)The doctor is there SOMETIMESI AM STILL waiting to get called back and I need my next round of meds desperately This process is all about timing and they make an already trying process needlessly more excruciating, frustrating, and expensive No good responses  This was very disappointing as you may expected  We found out our doctor was not monitoring us like we requested  I saw many bad reviews about their billing dept, but I was fine maybe because I studied about my own insurance and knew how much they would need to charge me It is all about mass processing, which results in carelessness Well, i didn't listen Dr and now i have a beautiful daughter Instead the people who work in the front desk are just rude and They don't call you back if you have an emergency I must have been visibly disappointed I found phone calls frustrating at times because they are incredibly busy I called them, a reception takes down your number, but i get no call back they are pretty bad with communications Cons: Billing department is pretty bad (poor communication skills and no follow up which means you spend a lot of time emailing, calling or going in-person to address mistakes on their end I found this to be a bit frustrating because I had to re-explain specific issues or concerns when I had questionsA yelp review doesn't seem like the appropriate place to review this facility The people at the front desk are not very helpful, and are rather rigid in their thinkingThe nursing staff seem ok, but some are not the best No communications, no solutions! The management of this clinic really sucks!  More importantly - It is a very easy out  to blame women's body's for the clinic's failures  There were failures at EVERY step of my cycleTerrible business practicesThey sent us an invoice for 350 USD saying this was a consultation, even though  we had not agreed to them calling us and had not agreed to these charges, and nothing medical was discussed Not for us here at New Hope My complaints and ire are solely directed at the management staff who perform their jobs horriblyWe had a bad experience at a different Fertility clinic in NY and changed to New Hope Of the negatives that some people might have, it doesn't give you the most personal of touch and sometimes seems to be mechanical in its operation, but this was never an issue for us personallyThe worst billing department!  I've called 4 times in 3 weeks asking to just pay a bill and no one will call me back and I can never get anyone on the line! As for the service itself, DrZhang was very overzealous about getting me in to do IVFThe front desk staff is rude and made of mostly empty headed idiots with nothing to offer I did post before a negative review about billing department but they corrected their mistake They received several warning letters and at the time had not complied in full I've been coming here for 6 months now, and seems like the longer I stay here the more frustration I have with them  There is a lot of lack of communication between patients and the medical staff Apparently there is a file with my name, but according to the nurse ""there is no way for me to go in to find the fax""The billing department there has annoyed me the most Because of their error, I ended up doing something that I did not need to and therefore wasted a month The waiting time on the day of a procedure is horrendousThis is starting to be a bummerworst place ever We could not believe it! We had beaten the odds Dr Zhang initially presented to us! The following weeks were stressful, but my numbers were all good The US tech was unfortunately not too encouraging but the following week, we had a wonderful tech that told us not to lose hope just yet Even though we are devastated by our loss, we can never say that we weren't well aware of the odds if there was a ZERO star functionality within YELP that is what I would give at this point!!! I am highly disgusted, disappointed, displeased,  and dismayed by the lack of responsiveness and and professionalism within this establishment I would NOT recommend this establishment to absolutely anyone (person, dog, cat or rat!!) MAY I ADD ONCE MORE!! No one bothered to mention that they would no longer be a participating provider as of September 1st - 7 days later! It is entirely inconceivable that they didn't know this during my consultation Moreover, not only did no one in the office bother to mention this upcoming insurance change during my initial consultation, but they never did, despite my arriving and checking-in for three following appointmentsThe care I received from this clinic was quite possibly the worst of my life I completely disagree with reviewers who say that New Hope feels impersonal - no, they have optimized their process so that they can serve all patients fast we all know this is not the only reason why a clinic is good or not, eveidently, so my reviewlwil be honest and accurate to help out people to understand pros and cons of this clinic (from my point of view) You have to know my husband and I ar both fertile, I mean no problem of fertility, but my husband had vasectomy so the sperm had to be extracted from the testicle (it is done at the uologist they refer, not at the clinic, who, by the way, was an awesome doctor) Now,the thign is not very good at this clnic is communication and organization towards the patient (Another issue is that they were ready to start my process immediately, but I wanted to wait a few more months; this got lost in communication between so many doctors/nurses so there was a stressful confusion of mismatched next-steps between them and me They are not open to communication, totally unresponsive and sometimes plain rude The problem is they do not return calls Bad customer response when confronted with request for explanation  We were infuriated  Such irresponsibility, and unprofessionalism should really lead their name to be ""No Hope"" I had chucked it all to ""that's life"" but to add insult to injury almost 7 years after I last saw Dr Zhang and demanded a refund (which they gave me) I get a bill in the mail (first time I'd heard from them in all those years) charging me for storage of a bio sample that I never knew they'd kept They refuse to speak to you or communicate directly, rather they send you messages that require login into a special system each time, (you get an email telling you to log in for your message rather than an email with the actual message!) I have been given the run around - asked to send things notarized (which I have done) and still they are not satisfied At this point what they're putting me through is a form of harassment and abuse More than seven years after first finding this place  I'm still regretting ever walking through that door Fertility issues are hard enough Different from my previous IVF experience where all staff sounds angry and coldI don't think the facility cares about its patient's complaints at all, especially its billing departmentI'm really on the fence about NHFC, after dealing with a new Fertility Center who caught some disturbing numbers in my records No one will call you back You will wait DAYS AND DAYS for a response from ANYONE in this entire practice, and that response will NEVER come!! You will call again and again and leave message after message You will start making your email subject lines more urgent & you will be downright enraged that you are BEING IGNORED by the very people who led you to believe you were in good hands My INS denied one of my procedures in January, I never heard anything from the clinic and ended up having the procedure done in MarchNew Hope is a big, terrible assembly lineStay far away from this awful place  I felt like I was in some strange baby making factory where everyone was cold, rude, unprofessional and not helpful""  When it was time to take blood, his ""nurse"" told us that everyone left for the day and there was no one available to take the blood   What kind of place is this?  They actually charge you $150 when you need to speak to a doctor!   It's disgusting  During this whole process, I was met with 2 nurses that were incredibly frustrating and not helpful  The two were incredibly unprofessional and rude Won't call again, won't put the health of my family in hands of a clinic with such an initial bad attitude I have been through hell and back with infertility problems and did 2 IVFs with the other clinics in NY like Cornellthe wait was never long,the staff was remarkable they let me cry and encouraged me , they kept me informed of process and always called when they said they would My draws at Cornell & NYU stunk in comparison  It was nearly impossible to get a call back from the nurses when I had timely questions regarding medication days before a procedure (which actually came close to ruining one of my retrievals)  On billing, I have literally left 15 messages and multiple emails regarding charges that I wanted more color on over the the last two months to no response which I find just unacceptableit is a crazy place to suck your money from your pocket and they do not care any results, they treat women like a cow, do not believe when you first time meet with doctor john, he just wants your money by any means, a liar with a luxury lv bag, stupid money cheating business, they will 1 time a layer to remove your money from your wallet until you finish with your pay and then they will dump you to the street No one tells you anything and email responses are spotty depending on what you are asking the problem is that the doctors are too overworked to really listen to you and expensive mistakes happen you get passed around so no one really knows you - you are a just a number and this is after they had messed up with my cycle (which took over 5 phone calls and several emails and finally i got a call back from the doctor admitting to mistakes being made earlier this month)",3.548076923076923
32,New Hope Fertility Center,Clinic,Neutral," It never took over 45 minutes for me to be seen  Answering patient phone calls  I did not get a response and had to email to get a resp I tried to reach out to the billing department several times but are not addressing my questions nor want to acknowledge the fact that they should have notified me about the eventuality of a cost"" That was the end of that conversation They said I was ovulating and to come in tomorrow morning to startI think the fact that they stayed open throughout the entire coronavirus pandemic says a lot about their business and philosophy  Money is their MO  My dentist closed down her clinic and donated all of her PPE to the nearest hospital  Most of the medical decisions are made by the nurses by some sort of protocol  When not at the center and I have questions, I send them an email It is a bit of a factory and you need to take responsibility for raising a flag when you know something doesn't work with your body  I get responses to my emails usually right away but always within a few hours You have to be your own advocate when you are working with NHFC becasue often times you feel like staff/ docs/ nurses that communicate with you do not care Many times, i have had to call, email three/frour times just to confirm that they received my test results and what my next steps were going to beI made appointment at 12pm, finally my name got called at 1:15pm  After speaking to the doctor - who appeared to have not even looked at my chart- missing vital info like I was on a medication dangerous for trying to conceive- I was told to come in over and over for monitoring On a few occasions we asked them who we might bring various issues to, so that the process went smoother, and nursing told us that they handled that For example, they even let junior embryologist directly do ICSI without going through training I don't know if they've gotten busier or if my pregnancy last time was just a matter of fate  The facility lets patients go home after one hour after IVF sedation  I do understand that many patients do not have someone to take them home, especially since the procedures are scheduled during the day I feel they don't know what they are doing I was left unattended in the exam table In an entire year i saw the doctor 4 times I am persistently calling to speak with someone about my embryos and I have been calling for days  Not a single person has called back I haven't gotten calls from everyone from the doctor to the people who process insurance to billingHello again  So we got our instructions for after the first monitoring - expected instructions  The doctors are always busy in the OR  The doctors are busy in the OR with egg retrieval (But nurse who did the ultrasound said i was ovulating) Try to use emails when you need a prescription sent or have a billing question i showed up to the office just to get an answer but outside of this, you won't hear from themI sent few emails to their customer service to enquire about their services The only reply I get is from the administrator who is handling this account on Yelp I had to go in one or twice because phone calls/emails weren't being responded to So your instructions are given by different nursesLastly, they make you wait quite a long time some times  I made clear my travel dates and they were ignored completely  I retrieved 24 eggs with that clinic  This clinic (though they claim extraordinary numbers) was able to retrieve less than half of the eggs I was able to produce  This business is founded, run and owned by men They told us they would need to go over it on the phone The next morning, we received a call early in the morning  They went over the questionnaire for 5 minutesThis is the second day in a row we have come to this place with a 9:00 appointment In and out on time and without hassle We waited a total of 8 hours longer than expected Appointments mean absolutely nothing at this place The front desk attendants did not recognize our second day reservation in the system We were told ""next in line"" on several occasions as the hours passed by It's as if the concept of scheduling and office management 101 are completely foreign at this place The staff was extremely polite and professional every time I went I never waited long at all I was 39 at the time for example you spoke to different nurses and doctors along the way, rather than having one dedicated to you You never see the same nurses and doctors so they never really know what the last person has said to you This would also concern me about their lab in general I just received yet another bill from them with a date of service that had never happened It always takes several calls/emails/months before they will rectify anything and every time I think everything is set with my bill, they send yet another bill A lot of the times when I emailed the nurses, I don't get a response until the next day or if at all, and this is considering that I sent the email before noon I had my medical records from my obgyn faxed twice and they still claimed that they have not received themThe only Issue I had with NHfC was getting accounting to respond to me They have no problem with asking me for money but pointing out there was a descrepancy in billing no one would answer  people are not nice, I see so many folks going else where like a factory here And it can be very busy in there at times 3 other doctors turned their backs on meWe have been going to NHFC on the recommendation of a staff member at our prior clinic in NJ I was still ovulating regularly I didn't mind that they kept their distance a little If I hadn't heard from them in an hour or so, I just emailed them again and got my answer They're busy Imagine what they deal with there The baby was measuring small On our third ultrasound, the baby had not grown and the heartbeat was slowingEach time that I went for a blood test or sono, there was little human interaction with the nursing staff I never felt that here But they are professional, quick, and they know what they are doingI personally think the clinic and the doctors worked very accurately based on a very customized procedure, they check on you, it seems, very specifically according to your hormone status and situation at that very day and moment th internal organization is not very precise, but not in terms of professional and medical outcome, but in terms of communication with the patientThey work of a voicemail ITS A MONEY MACHINE Different from other IVF places where the monitoring hours are usually up until 8 or 9 am I tried contacting the billing department through emails and calls to discuss the billing issue, and was not called back after 2 months and numerous attempts to reach them  Here is the complete text of the abstract that called them out for those false claims This clinic may not refuse service to people but you have to ask yourself if it's really worth the trouble The nurses will not return your call The nurses will not reply to your email But for all the tests we were taking, none of the doctors or nurses ever knew what any of it meantThe doctors, nurses and technicians are rushed, uncaring and clumsy - both with information and with equipment   We visited this clinic in May  in that ""this place should be shut down""  There are other places close by that DO NOT CHARGE you $150 to speak with the doctor The consultation and blood work is supposed to take only an hour, but your wait time to be seen will be MUCH longer From scheduling retrievals throughout the day, to longer monitoring hours, etcNYU & CORNELL are FACTORIES)  New Hope intentionally choses staff to minimize IVF patients' stress But I've personally seen that this office has far more concern about people's wallets than other places  I had my first appointment today  I was then seen soon after by a nurse for sonogram, blood work and even spoke with their billing departmentand they will do everything they can to get every penny out of you  And I am actually not working with them at the moment and decided to go to an acupuncturist  Just watch out HOWEVER, what will keep me from referring a friend to this clinic is the poor level of customer service you receive from the techs, billing, etc  When you visit the office never expect to leave within an hour and a half  My sense is their patient count and overall program awareness has grown faster than they can keep up with and they don't have the appropriate staff in place to properly manage the inflows Their hours of monitoring and insemination are longer which considering average life of donor sperm is about 12 hours, if you're ovulating at midnight, you could do your insemination at 1pm - but they won't tell you this, you have to find out and ask when you think you're ovulating and work backwards and come in at 1pm on your own  Here, the doctor is hardly ever available albeit knowledgeable",3.548076923076923
33,New Hope Fertility Center,Protocol,Positive," We got genetic testing done, blood work and another semen analysis for my husband, I got follicle monitoring done every week and bloodwork to check my levels and was told they wanted to begin with The IUI procedure 3 times before I went into IVF The IUI procedure was painless and they attempted two rounds per IUI I went back and New hope lifted my spirits Thanks to the lovely Dr Liu, who took the time to create a personalised stims and implantation plan according to my previous medical history and body cycle   This is so important for women to know Yesterday I gave birth to my miracle baby My husband convinced me to try one last time after we sat in a hot tub with a few drinks in our system during a trip to Dominican Republic in May 2019 I just laughed and I said okay just one last time hun after this we have to move forward with other options even if it meant I would never carry our own child So that's what I did transferred two embryos in June and here we are with a beautiful healthy baby girl I ended up doing two rounds of IVF because I had a very pushy and convincing nurse and doctor telling me my hormones level were good and I should try this month because I was ovulated A few issues, one, I didn't do the recommended tests yet, two, I used an OPK when I woke up the day of the test and I wasn't ovulating (though I know these aren't 100% accurate), third, New Hope won't enroll you in Aetna's fertility program, you We now are going to Kofinas Fertility and it's amazing  I left New Hope years ago and I am glad that I did  I was treated very well by the phlebotomist and the nurse who did my transvaginal ultrasoundSo far I am very happy with this fertility clinic, and it is my fifth oneand it's a significant one I froze my eggs there and did Mini IVF  I can't believe the negative reviews for NH because my experience has only been positive  All in all, I recommend the practice and especially Dr Merhi!I have had success because my case wasn't very complicated First time here, definitely the last time as well!!!I have been happy so far with my process The genetic results (NICS) took longer than usual but overall I am happy We have one healthy embryo to transfer  I came here over a year ago as recommended by my OB-gyn  I am currently in my first IVF cycle and wish I wouldn't have waited so long after this awful experience at New Hope(I post this on behalf of my friend who wants to remain anonymous) My husband and I planned to have kids right after we got married, but with no success after 3-5 years of trying  Along the way 10+ precious years passed After months, we were told we were ready After 6 months, we had egg retrieval and 4 frozen embryos   I am still in the process of undergoing procedures but I am hopeful I started there a year ago with follicle reaching the size of 15 a year later they couldn't detect not one We knew we want one doctor to follow our case  The recommended clomid intake was too high both times and it burned our follicles  No one came to talk to us till we are ready to our 5th cycle  I was recommended for treatments using donor eggs at the first consultation at a clinic in NJ before my treatment wasn't even started because I was 43  At the first IVF at NHFC, I got one blastocyst and it gave us a hope  I finally got the good blastocyst at 45 years old and transferred, got pregnant and had a baby at 46 years old I also love that all their procedures are done in-house, from bloodwork, sonograms, embryo transfers, collecting sperm specimens, etc I am happy to report I am 10 weeks pregnant after my 1st embryo transfer My husband and I couldn't be happier, because Dr Merhi really took his time with ensuring we had as high of a success rate as possible I was diagnosed with PCOS which is probably the simplest condition to treat 10 minutes after the visit the doctor tells me to wait my period and then to start with the pills to stimulate ovulation I had nothing but success with Dr Merhi and I am so happy I decided to go with New Hope for my mini IVF cycle We tried less medications (yay!) and a more gentle approach Practice is willing to work with you and even do a retrieval if you only get one egg (which was the case for me on my one and only successful cycle - got one egg, PGS tested, and I'm now 29 weeks pregnant) I'm in the middle of 'egg retrieval process', just starting to stimulate my eggs  I was freezing eggs to extend fertility  New Hope retrieved only 6 I was able to freeze 22 eggs The retrieval was not anxiety producing and I didn't feel rushed If I end up using the frozen eggs, I'll go back to NHFC for the rest of the treatment It had been a very stressful journey doing IVF but it now ended perfectly at NHFC  I decided to pass on IVF and was naturally pregnant with a healthy baby 9 months later  They had me come in for a dose of a drug that would trigger ovulation without testing me for ovulatory disorders I got the best results with him as I am 9 weeks pregnant I've actually never had surgery before either so I was dreading the retrieval When my ovarian count was down he put me on certain vitamins and medications that brought it backOur baby boy arrived a few days ago! We went through two cycles with NHFC and was successful on the second try  And now I have a 3 year old daughter because of new hope He told us that we had a 5-10% chance of getting pregnant and then if we did get pregnant, there would be a 45% chance of miscarriage His honesty was sobering, but we decided to proceed anyway with Mini IVF 12 days later, I had a positive pregnancy test I know that if I wanted to continue, NHFC would allow me to We are now ready to talk about using donor eggs The first opinion from other clinic wanted me to have an invasive surgery, but Dr Yang suggested not to and gave me a different conception plan instead After a month with NHFC, i got pregnant and now have a beautiful daughter  Dr Zhang is no-nonsense  However, I was compelled to continue and keep trying because I wanted this more than anything  We went to New Hope fertility because I had read how they were more into natural fertility (in other words, they didn't pump you with drugs, but worked more with your one ovulation cycle)I had only 1 cycle of mini ivf with this clinic and the outcome was an healthy beautiful baby I insisted I wanted to try and the Dr, after explaining my chances were very low around 8%, suggested no invasive treatments, only some pills and just monitor very closely my cycle trying to get the best out of my excpetd only 1 or maximum 2 eggs (at this age they know you won't produce much, so it is common use not to prescribe much medicine) They also suggest to study the embryo befor transfring to the uterus, something also very important and professional, considering at this clinic you don't pay for the entire event, but step by step meaning, if the transfer doesn't have place they lose that part of th money All these arangemnts and suggeestions were valuable and I thought well of thm because of them  After reviewing my test results and considering my age, Dr Zhang recommended the best approach for me is to do 2 cycles of IUI before proceeding to IVF despite both my husband and I were ready to proceed with IVF right awayI had two successful transfers done with Dr Zhang The other doctors wanted me to go for donor egg and didn't want to try any treatment but Dr Zhang had confidence that I could get pregnant with my own eggs After three useless cycles (where they gave me the same 1st line medication that wasn't working), I went to another office which gave me the most advanced combination of three different medicines and I had a successful pregnancy They never said I needed to do anything in particular to make sure that they wouldn't keep my biological material  He assured me we will figure it out and we did  After years of trying at other facilities that treated us as just another experiment, we conceived  Third, in my case at least, I fell like Dr Zhang's more natural approach to the hormones intake end up fitting  more my body We decided to go ahead and in the first cycle, we end up with 10 eggs retrieved and 2 healthy embryos Dr Zhang even told me that at my age, to be able to produce two healthy embryos was a very very good result He suggested implanting one embryo and last month I gave birth to a healthy baby We now have a happy and healthy baby boy  I signed up to join this study  Low-intensity IVF: real progress?  Reprod Biomed Online In the absence of properly controlled studies, all forms of LI-IVF should be considered experimental and be offered only in well-controlled research settings and with appropriate informed consent    He pulled out charts and graphs that stated the percentages of healthy births with IVF vs   I agree with Jasmine R  My husband and I had been to three other REs and we were on the verge of giving up  All of our embryos were normal, and we decided to go ahead and implant the healthiest of the bunch They practice innovative methods of stimulating eggs to focus on quality rather than just quantity Throughout the process, I didn't feel any discomfort I was very worried when they transferred it but they have an 85% success rate on normal embryo transfers One week later, I went in for my pregnancy test and It was positive!!! Today I am sitting with my 9 week old, healthy baby boy, Maceo Gael They miss the details that would optimize timing and tweaking during each step of the cycle They might tell you to take a drug (like a trigger shot), but then not even test for it the next day May we all have a healthy child of our own  Dr Zhang was hopeful that he would be able to help me conceive possibly without additional hormones, which is called a Natural IVF cycleI have done 2 iui's at nh on my way to do ivf - all with donor sperm",3.548076923076923
34,New Hope Fertility Center,Protocol,Negative," After the first failed IUI I was broken I started to get worried about getting pregnant as it was determined I needed several hysteroscopies before being able to implant I was seen by Dr Merhi and would not recommend him With Multiple attempts of ivf, surrogacy and my own transfers I was just so tired and unhappy I took this decision because oneI was also told that my insurance was covering IVF so why not and I could have a fresh embryo without taking any medicationno the saline test This was really shocking because I had been told I needed an HSG test to see if my tubes were blocked but they still wanted to move forward with it have to do it yourself, but since I wasn't getting the treatment yet I hadn't enrolled so I would of had to pay out of pocket for this but lastly, she had just told me I might have had endometriosis and they weren't even going to look into that? Needless to say, I left there hysterically crying and never went back""  There is no excuse for that period I'm a 36 year old woman, was born with only one fallopian tube, a polyp in my uterus that needed to be surgically removed, and a moderate to severe hereditary hormone imbalanceAfter we decided to stop treatment due to a number of failed attempts, we explained that we were going to stop with the doctor involved We received a short statement that we would no longer be communicated with I cannot imagine I spent my precious two years to do IVF here for many cyclesSo I come for my IUI treatment but it got delayed due to the waiting time  I highly not recommend this place  We found a famous doctor in NJ, tried rounds of artificial insemination and 3 IVFs in total, all failed I continued physical exercises, jogging, keeping fit and losing weight, for half a year  When it came to transfer, I insisted on having 2 embryos, though Dr Zhang suggested only 1 since I was 43 at the time and considered a high-risk case  We do sign a waiver at the end of the procedure stating we are going home alone I was left on the exam table waiting for a doctor to explain to me why a year later i have no follicles After 30 minutes i decided to leave because i realized i was forgotten  We didnt want to repeat history  Results - the follicles were lost  After going thru conventional 2 IVFs, I decided to change my clinic because I was so depressed and hopeless since I couldn't get any blastocysts  Also, the clinic in NJ made me feel pressured to use donor eggs and uncomfortable to continue treatments there due to my age then the problems started After a month of trying the Dr suggested the IVF which i didn't want to do Bc i truly believe in the ""old way"" to make babies since i only had PCOS This is critical prior to retrieval or transfer  Barring the failure to stimulate properly, at retrieval they only got 6 of those 14 eggsDr Merhi has been my primary doctor with my Mini IVF cycles and I couldn't be happier I froze my eggs as a preventative measure--- I was clueless about fertility, taking medication (I have never taken anything!), sonograms and retrievals  There was a time when I forgot to re-order the medication on time (everything has to be taken at a specific time, on a specific day)  When starting the IVF process when other doctors said that I should cancel my cycle due to lab work he corrected that faulty lab results by tweaking our medications We had done a cycle at another fertility center before moving on to NHFC and there is no comparison! Dr Zhang introduced me to mini-ivf which involves not as many meds/injections as traditional ivf done at previous clinic Maybe, at 6+ months now, if I had news such as I am pregnant, I would ignore all of the above So we left our clinic because they refused to retrieve my eggs unless I had at least 3 viable ones  I went to New Hope at age 42 after 2 failed IVF attempts that resulted in a miscarriage In fact, it wasn't until we asked whether a particular procedure was covered that they bothered to mention that my insurance was no longer accepted and we would be stuck with bill  After 3 failures, I thought I was doomed   Because of my age, we did not have success after a year  However, it took us about 3 years trying for the second one with no successTerrible Place!! Do NOT go there!!I went to New Hope Fertility for over 6 months and was not been tested for any procedural infertility testing, such as X-Ray examination for normal uterine cavity and Fallopian tubes patency Still have no idea Even if I had no problem of my reproduction system, I would become infertile with stress while dealing with this place They wasted my time with their assembly-line tactics and robbed me of a year of my fertility All these years later I feel my privacy violated knowing they have kept this after we fired them  I knew my body was reacting to the medication and no one listened In my case, I had tried 4 cycles of conventional IVF in another renown place (RMA), with no success 2011 Sep;23(3):274-8 The data presented failed to support their conclusions  I have tried all options and have still hit a hard stop This experience convinced us to cut our losses and leave I thought this was odd  Since when did Doctor's and Nurses stop taking blood?  With this, Dr Zhang called me the next day with his ""plan"", which was to try 1 IUI, then go straight to IVF  That embryo resulted in our son, and we couldn't be more grateful Instead of pumping you with tons of costly hormone shots to produce as many as eggs with swollen stomach and many bad sign effects, Dr Zhang and his staff customized their techniques based on each patient My first one I did was at NYU which worked but the heartbeat stopped at 6 weeks He suggested I do a mini IVF as I was over 40 and sometimes the high dosage of drugs can be very harsh on your body He also suggested I Freeze whatever embryo's go blastocyst, then test them first for any  problems chromosome before I transfer them back into me''  No one asked my how my body felt with the embryo in me or wanted to discus the possibilities of why I did not end up getting pregnant",3.548076923076923

Their job should be to make it as easy as possible (and do everything they can to work with insurance) to get people in there They also work with you regarding the NYS Infertility grant program  We decided to try reproductive assistance since our insurance also covered this kind of service  What I liked about NHFC is NHFC doctors listen to you and work with patients together I want to say it was a long journey almost a year, very expensive but well worth it I am 9 weeks pregnant and this part made us feel more comfortable as we paid out of pocket  When I reached out to the billing department to ask for an itemized bill explaining what I was being charged for, they told me my bill would be forgiven  Thats nice but Thanks NHF for a great job!!! The price from the other places are way more expensive compare to New Hope The staff over the past year has mainly been excellent We had some minor issues with billing, but I am extremely lucky that insurance covered the bulk of my treatment I can't say enough about the care I received at New HopeCame to NHFC for a second opinion and ended up sticking to their care Their billing representative admitted that they should have told us, but still refused to reduce the amount of the bill to what they would've accepted from our insurance company under the circumstances It was a financial sacrifice, but worth every pennyGood service until transfer I was never told that these would not be destroyed after we terminated our relationship and they refunded our money It was New Hope's misinformation that misled us thinking our treatment (embryo banking) would be coveredEverything is good besides the billing department Well, I went to Zhang *after* going to that doctor (he's definitely skilled & the best doc at NYU-FC) & after that guy's institution took nearly six-figures worth of our money -- our savings -- how much of savings does that NYU guy have? Meanwhile that NYU doc gets paid a seven-figure salary from NYU plus doing glamour stints on TV shows, etc  They are basically their to make sure you pay  i should have listened to the reviews and saved my time and money i went there for the embryology dept and under the false promises of Dr Zhang that he would pay attention to my case for the cycle",3.548076923076923

42,NYU Langone Fertility Center,Doctor,Positive," Today, I am grateful I ended up at NYU Fertility Center in the year 2000 with the best Doctor ever: Dr Licciardi (I just saw on their website he is still there and I know he is a great asset to NYU Fertility Center) I was surprised when I learned he wasn't the one conducting my retrieval but he called me and put me at ease about who was doing the retrieval I really thought Dr Licciardi's care was excellent during the process I definitely felt that he cared and I wasn't just another number in the factory He is compassionate, smart, caring, available, etc Based on my extensive research, I learned that Dr Grifo is one of the most prominent IVF experts in the country and that he has had personal experience with IVF in his own familyI (40 year old) am holding my miracle child after 10 years of infertility and IF treatments (previous patient at Cornell and Columbia (stay far away from here!!!)Dr Berkeley took my rare case (less than 1% of his patients) and believed they could help melike any Infertility clinic- it gets busy- but never felt like the cattle call at CornellI've sent several friends to Dr Berkely with confidence and would send my sister (if I had one! ) to him It was my first time going under anesthesia, and I was terrified--but the whole thing ended up being just as efficient as the rest of my care at NYU  She was good at making me feel comfortable with the process  For me, recovery wasn't bad  Apparently, my husband's sperm (which he provided a few weeks earlier and looked 'great' at the time) - did not come out of frozen in a good state Dr Leeds was my doctor and was honest with me about the chances for success and limits to the procedureDr Grifo is my phenomenal doctor who came highly recommended and has lived up to his word-of-mouth He knows these processes so well that after a cycle or two, he masterfully tailors the drugs to what the individual patient can tolerateDr Noyes is also freaking amazing Number two: she has had a great sense of humor, a jovial, approachable manner, and a clear underlying focus on results whenever I've interacted with her Dr Noyes is rigorous, meticulous, courageously honest about what patients can expect and should do, and dedicated to high performance standards Dr Noyes will cut through that insidious optimism and help you make statistically informed decisions The doctor who performed the ultrasound was kind, said everything was normal, and we got to take pictures and a video of our baby's heartbeat Dr Licciardi listened to us carefully, provided his recommendations clearly and confidently, and ultimately helped us conceive our first baby in three months of treatment! I would recommend Dr Licciardi to anyone looking for a warm, knowledgable, caring support on the journey to conception Dr Grifo was my doctor, and yes, while I didn't see him every cycle, he was always available by phone and my husband and I often set up calls with him to check in and he did design and adjust my meds with each cycle and day-to-day, especially towards the time of retrieval)  Overall, I thought NYU was efficient and professional, and I'm very pleased with my experience  My doctor was Dr Liccardi, who was very nice and knowledgable, and called me the day I started stims to make sure I was okWe had Dr Keefe, and he is awesome My doctor is amazing (Hodes-Wertz), the other docs I've interacted with are friendly and knowledgable,  and the nurses absolutely make the place Highly recommend!We are patients of Dr Grifo and couldn't have had a better experience and are sooo thankful for his expertise  Dr Grifo  is unbelievably brilliant, he gave us great advice along the way, he addressed all our questions and concerns, and their clinic is state-of-the-art in technical advancements I don't remember what Doctor handled our implantation- but she was fantastic  When I finally spoke to my doctor, I felt like she was talking down to me despite the fact that I am a healthcare professional and this isn't my first IVF  I felt like she couldn't even be bothered with explaining her decision to me The doctors are amazing, and very approachable",5.0
43,NYU Langone Fertility Center,Doctor,Negative,"I've heard bad things about Cornell (and nothing positive), so I wouldn't recommend them either Every time we receive a bill it is like PTSD about our past failed cycles 4) They told me that I need to book an appointment with Dr Berkley to complain about all of the above* Overall while I am sure that Dr Berkley is an expert in the infertility treatment, I personally did not feel that his care was different/exceptional from other physicians and that NYU internal workflow/communication was the worst I have ever seen I had repeated failed cycles here, and questioned their earlier representations to me I found Dr Grifo's behavior to be unprofessional and beneath the standards I would expect for a physician - despite the fact that he delayed my procedure due to their on-the-spot demands for money - he had the gall and distaste to say to me that he could have made $3,000 during the time he was speaking to me I found the experience traumatic and, as mentioned earlier, repeated cycles were entirely unsuccessful My dr was DR Keefe, who spend some time with us during initial consultation, however it was very difficult to get a hold of him directly for any questions after that He was inaccessible and his secretary at the time was new and not helpful  The first problem occurred when the secretary gave me the wrong appointment time and date  It was in her handwriting, so she knew she wrote it wrong and all she could do was apologize profusely",5.0
44,NYU Langone Fertility Center,Doctor,Neutral," Dr Licciardi was my doctor but I saw him only twice during the process We met at the consult and then he preformed one ultrasound He was always accessible by phone and email, and he called me several times to keep me updated and to check on me He seems to know exactly what to do in more difficult situations like mine where the body doesn't react to the medicine quickly By the time they had me on ganirelix I did feel twinges in my abdomen and felt bloated Note:  Dr Noyes is the most statistically oriented of the doctors with whom I've interacted""I later emailed Dr Noyes (she didn't respond) and called the office to clarify I only met with Dr Noyes once during the process  When I spoke to others at the office, they kept telling me to call her  I felt like i was being jerked around All of that, it took them 45 minutes to figure out, and after he was told numerous times that he did not have an appointment  I felt that Dr Berkley was not involved in the decision making/ guidance after the initial visit  * I and the NYU staff was not able to communicate with Dr Berkley in regards to issue that were time sensitive Twelve thumbs up for Dr Licciardi and his staffI had a nightmarish experience at this center, and with Dr Grifo  We went in for our first visit with Dr Grifo and, even though I had an incredibly large history file for him to review, he knew exactly what to try from day 1 He was open to trying new things, and answered every question I sent, at any time of day",5.0
45,NYU Langone Fertility Center,Advice,Positive," Second, no one is going to hold your hand during the process You owe it to your future self to go to the best provider Do your research and be proactive, but love yourself no matter what happens He truly cares about his patients and wants the best for them One of the most important things to look for is that the doctor studies your charts after each test and adjusts the medication and protocol accordingly to maximize your chances for a positive outcome  I hope to go back for a sibling and hope that if you go here you walk away with your miracle Please note, it has never taken another Doc more than 1 tryWould recommend, would do again, and will definitely go to NYU for any future fertility care I may need in the future  I recommend bringing your SO (if you have one) so that you can do your paperwork together under supervision Also, I strongly recommend icing to help make the shots more bearable  When they determine you are ready, they'll tell you a specific time to take your trigger shot; your procedure will be 35 hrs later Note - the retrieval doctor is unlikely to be *your* doctor (from the consult); fine by me, but some people may not realize this going in  I also think a call at least once during the cycle from the doctor of your initial consult would help immensely to improve 'feel Just see that you are above 40 and tell you that your only hope is to use donor eggs Still no certainties what will happen, but they skills gave me the best chance possible Look instead at the most recent literature from the medical community and to sources you can trust for expert and accurate advice The NYU clinic is associated with one of the best research universities in the world after all Still, it's important to keep in mind that this process is basically a scientific miracle I am impressed with his intellect and dedication to continuing research in fertility He is exactly who you want on your make-a-baby team Number 1: Who cares!? She is a scientist and surgeon, not a therapist I also highly recommend Dr Fino - another experienced straight shooter who will not BS you about what to expect And if you have Dr Grifo, definitely let him do whatever he thinks best with your drug protocol Empower yourselves and use the team of doctors to your advantage Way better than reading fertility forums which tend to be overly optimisticFrom a donor perspective: make sure to do your research! This was a great resource for me, straight from the New York Department of Health: health Consider where you go carefully - your health matters, too""Me: ""Ok, so I guess I should have this baby and get the vaccines right after and then I won't be getting pregnant within 30 days?""Nurse: ""Well you need to get the vaccine before you get pregnant, so you don't want to wait Why not?! So bizarreDr Licciardi is absolutely amazing His warmth and understanding put us at ease right away  Just wish the rest of the experience was more pleasant and straight forwardI agree with the others regarding doctors/nurses not giving much attention to you or your future Thank you, NYU  In this consultation, he/she first reviews your medical history and talks you through it, and also provides a detailed overview of the process, and statistical chances of success)  After that, you're ready to start whenever you're ready  Once the doctor doing your ultrasound deems you ""ready,"" they'll schedule your retrieval procedure, usually two days later, and instruct you to take a trigger shot, diagram of the female reproductive system), with the most relevant info (dos and don'ts) kind of mixed in easy to forget  I will add my two cents and will try to be as fair and intelligent as possible in my thoughts, because, if you are reading this, you are contemplating some big stuff in your life!Disclaimer: my partner and I did this electively - we froze our embryos - and we are not trying to conceive at this time  I can say that Dr Grifo is awesome, too, because I had some contact with him also  You will be making regular visits, and it is the rest of the staff that you will be working with, and you will be super hormone'd up and extra sensitive, to boot  Also, you feel a little bit like cattle, going through the process  Nobody will ever simply ask you how you are feeling  (I'm all for it because it will help future couples conceive, but if you don't want a student in there, just speak up and say so  Try not to over-worry this partI had the best experience here! I love the team and everything went so smoothly! I highly recommend you go to NYU you will not regret it I honestly cannot say enough about my experience here Yes, you may not see your actual doc often - that's how it works at all fertility clinicsthis is especially impressive since everyone else had no idea how to proceedthey deal with facts and are there to help give you the highest probability of having a baby  When you go to the best of the best, you DO get different results  Let them do what they do besthelp give you the greatest gift of life  They work with Walgreens and Livestrong to get you all of your hormones free of charge He's truly sweet and honestly caring, on top of being an amazing expert  The MDs do not seem invested in patient care",5.0
46,NYU Langone Fertility Center,Advice,Negative," Get there at 7 am to avoid the wait for blood work You have to go into this knowing that you are going to drop thousands of dollars Recommendations for NYU:  I think the biggest issue for NYU in terms of 'feel' is the lack of a single point of contact for your cycle No effort to try anything  They ""explain"" things to you as if you work there and do all these things every day, but most of us do each of the things we need to do in this process one time and have no idea what NYU is talking about I think it's hard to find someone in New York who doesn't just care about the money and know there will also be lots of patients in the pipeline, even if they get some bad reviews) The trouble with egg freezing is that people should probably have ~20 eggs banked if they donate at age 36-37 and want a 50% chance at a live birth Having a child genetically related to oneself following cancer or into one's 40s is a triumph of technology over the harsher side of nature I read on here that maybe she isn't always warm and fuzzy If you are a logical, statistical thinker, you will get sick of all the anecdotal and narrative evidence batted around in fertility forums and between moms There are medical risks associated with egg donation, and donors should go through the procedure fully informed of those risks I do not feel confident that the health of donors is given enough consideration at NYU - there are other options in the city""Nurse: ""If you're not going to follow our advice to get the vaccine, you'll need to sign a waiver saying you understand the risksMy experience with Yelp reviews is that they are mostly either excellent or disastrous, and so I am writing to give a more nuanced picture There was a training session to explain the egg freezing process and ask questions, as all the language around different hormones and cycles can be overwhelmingDespite this, I think my doctor is great payment plan, timing, your chart and what's missing, etc We couldn't be happier with the care we received there  I'll briefly describe the steps of their egg freezing cycle:  first, you go in for bloodwork on day 2/3  Before you leave, you get your egg count  But unfortunately, you spend very little of your time here with your doc  My other negative is that they really just don't prepare you for the enormity of what you are going through  I would read up on IVF, the hormones, the injections you give yourself, the pain and discomfort that you will experience, and the procedure, before you proceed  They really don't provide the support for the emotions that you will experience, or even the physical pain, so you have to find this support elsewhere   When I think about it, this is crazy to me, because, by all accounts, stress and anxiety are really bad for fertility, but they don't seem to give a crap about any stress or anxiety you are feeling  I think it will make you crazy to second-guess the doctors here, but hey, hormones make you do crazy things!  Anything having to do with making babies is an inexact science, that's just the way it isTo anyone considering using NYU, keep in mind that the NYU team isn't there for emotional support I called the number on the statement to inquire about the additional $950, she tells me that there's no record of the $6950 payment Puts me on hold, she than comes back to say that I need to call the NYU fertility office and have them release the $950 to be paid to the anesthesiologist Wouldn't send my friends/relatives any place else!",5.0
47,NYU Langone Fertility Center,Advice,Neutral," Egg quality is a mystery until you make embryos Sixth, be realisticDr Licciardi is an angel Other clinics often make you follow a generic protocol and shrug when you don't get results even though they should know that every body reacts differently to the medicine And they ask for $500 to give you your own eggs if you decide to transfer them elsewhere Initial consult w/ Dr Noyes""  Later, the call comes with info about how much medication to take You are also told your egg count (mine was 12) To be realistic about it: shooting yourself with hormones every day is grueling I would advise anyone above 40 (women) NOT to pursue treatment here Or else never would I choose to work with these physicians  But with very few (like one person) exceptions, they don't care about you at all  Maybe try CCRM?  Or get out of New York if you can He's got the art side of this process down Although this procedure is elective, donors should be entitled to understand potential medical complications I'll update as those bills come in (Those are LIVE vaccines which are NOT given during pregnancy!)Nurse: ""You need to go to a clinic to get the MMR and chickenpox vaccines Just wait 30 days to get pregnant  In the meantime, after speaking with someone below her at the office, I called insurance myself and relayed all the info - Insurance told me to go ahead with the procedureBelow is the brief summary of our experience with NYU  * I only spoke with Dr Berkley once on the initial visit  I'd look for other options Yes they don't hold your hand but they really deliver  Then you do an initial consultation with the doctor you chose  (They also will check your insurance for you to see if any of the medications are covered  Then, that afternoon, a nurse will call you, give you your estrogen levels, and give you instructions on what to take for then next few days and when to come back  Amen, sister!  You are so right on that  It is also an emerging and changing field  There may be students in some of your appointments  Needles have come a LONG way  The anesthesiologist stays with you the whole time  Which is, after all, their job Apparently he is only part time at NYU and also has another practice",5.0
48,NYU Langone Fertility Center,Nurse,Positive," I also remember a very caring and nice nurse, I am not sure I am spelling her name properly: Nurse Oana (I think she was from Romania or an Eastern European country, not sure) anyway, all the nurses were very supportive during this emotional journey They were all excellent She was responsive, knowledgeable and easy to work with3 Orientation:  This provided useful information on how everything would proceed  That was the most important part for me  So, it's pretty clear what they really care about I was confused because I'd initially been told I'd just need the first and 48-hour tests, but the nurse said it was necessary to confirm things were moving successfullyI've recently did my first ever IVF cycle at NYU and my experience was really great! Nurses and staff were really efficient, straight to the point and nice) in her two main points: 1)  If you want results, you are as likely to get them here as anywhere else2)  They are NOT into giving ""more emotional type support to their clients"" Phone calls post-testing or procedure have always been timely, and they make sure you understand all instructions The nurses are helpful, especially Carol and Andrea and will answer your questions and call you back",5.0
49,NYU Langone Fertility Center,Nurse,Negative," Every phone/email interaction took no less than THREE tries  She finally called me back over a week later and told me she had been on vacation - apparently no one was covering for her and no one knew she was on vacation  When the woman from NYU returned from vacation and returned my call, she became upset with me because I had spoken to someone else in her department in billing!  It was really quite odd",5.0

51,NYU Langone Fertility Center,Clinic,Positive," They have a great team and I have to thank them for having given me the most precious gift I have: my daughter I had an excellent experience, but I can see why some people may have complaints Actually, it gave me comfort to know that the center is a well oiled machine All of the doctors are highly skilled with decades of experience so you will always be in great handsFourth, you will get excellent results My insurer was giving me the runaround and I couldn't wait any longerI am happy to say that I had a good experience with Dr Grifo at NYU and much better results than at another clinic (which I also reviewed)  I loved the whole clinic - minus a nurse or two- but on the whole- have loved my experience with them- ans again- this wasn't my first time aroundGenetic counselor, Andria was the only bright spot at this clinic (have been to 3 clinics at this point) When it got sent to me, more than half of the records were missing, but luckily the few items I needed where thereI chose NYU for my egg freezing because they are reputed to be the top facility for this procedure in the United States, if not the world  I was NOT disappointed!  In every step of the process, I was greeted with warm, friendly, attentive nurses and methodical doctors   You will feel like a product on an assembly line, but that's a good thing; you'll get the impression that NYU has done this many, many times before The morning visits were smooth and calm  Monitoring is something you'll be doing a lot of; it's quick (~20 min), and then you are on your way (maybe leading to the factory feel that some have reported, but I liked the expediency)About monitoring:  I felt like the nurses were great, caring and competent  Monitoring also makes you feel like you're in a spy movie; every day you are told to ""await a phone call with further instructions About the shots:  Mixing Menopur takes a lot more time than expected!  Prepare to spend ~20 min each night setting everything up and take extra precautions to ensure you are doing it right Recovery: Once you have demonstrated your vitals are ok and you can use the bathroom on your own they send you out with a few docs about what to do/not to do and look for over the next week Overall, I was lucky not to have significant side effects from any part of the process or procedure Overall I would consider the experience generally positive due to the quality of people at NYU and feeling in safe hands  If they could somehow ensure a single, constant person greeted you each day for monitoring and later called you with instructions, it might feel a bit more personalized  They treat you like nameless, faceless cattle because that is what you are to them  People who are ""coordinating"" things say things like, ""Did you tell so and so?"" And you're thinking ""I emailed every person with an email address, am I supposed to personally call every person whose name I've ever heard at NYU until I reach them after going through the switchboard? Isn't that, perhaps, your job? They are, of course, totally on top of billing - that part is always very clear and taken care of first and foremost This demonstrates to me that they did their job wellAsk questions and do your research intelligently: The NY Department of Health guidebook for egg donors mentioned by another reviewer is already 20 years old (1998!) and hasn't been updated since They do need improvement in some areas but are unlike commercial clinics that might look fancier but are exclusively for-profit I was laughing and talking about gelato as I waited for the anesthesia to kick in Then I had an effortless, painless recovery I wish they'd waited until after the ultrasound, so I could have avoided an unnecessary blood draw and bruised arm This place is a mill, they treat you like cattle But this is not even my main complaint It was well organized and although there are a lot of people handling you and your visits, I felt they were competent and everything was done professionally I had a friend help me with this process, but the Center should be able to provide more training and support at this point I recommended a friend to the Center who had a similar experienceI think the doctors are top-notch here and they are worth coming here for, but the support staff needs reorganizationThe nurses are good at responding to voicemails, but their response is always to tell you to speak with billingAlso - I would skip the Recombine Genetic testing that they recommend here 1) You feel like you are in a vacuum But, they don't realize that the phone tag play is pretty awful I guarantee that they will not pick up your call (no matter which number you call), and you leave a vm, and if you ever miss their callback, good luck because when you call back, that will go to vm againGreat Doctors, but HORRIBLE customer service IVF is a very difficult process physically and emotionally, but the team at NYU is caring, knowledgeable and very well coordinated The give clear, individualized instructions and are available to answer questions The nurses are caring and compassionate and the embryology team is very good They are clear in their results and straightforward On my last day there I receive a warm goodbye and I felt cared for And pregnant, which I am deeply grateful to the team there for Kind, helpful, compassionate, human I was dreading ER but my experience in OR was great! No pain after and nurses were very comforting when I woke up Overall the whole process was very smooth and much easier than I originally expected NYU has a great team of doctors, nurses, embryologists - I was really impressed  (This is a long review, but I wanted to describe the whole experience  Then, he/she does an examination to make sure everything looks in order down there)  You pick a pharmacy (I highly recommend Apthorp -- they deliver!), and NYU will call in your prescriptions  You go in for bloodwork on your day 2, and then that afternoon, if you're bloodwork is solid, you're cleared to start meds and they'll tell you exactly what to take and when, and when to come back into the office  The next day, a nurse calls you and tells you how many of those were able to be freezed, and of those, how many are mature  Overall, I was very pleased with the experience  It's true that you don't see the doctor much, if at all, after your initial consult, but I really did not mind as every doctor I saw (they rotate in the mornings to do the ultrasounds) was very competent and nice and I never felt that I was not in good hands  There is definitely a ""factory"" feel to the process, and sometimes you feel guilty holding up the process by asking questions (they just move that fast), but I actually overall appreciated that quality, because it made the entire experience very efficient and not much of an intrusion into my daily routine  I did at times wish I had a direct line to someone, but I realize they are busy treating patients and not sitting by the phone  In terms of areas for improvement, my only complaint would be the orientation process  Also, the nurse that did our orientation (both times -- I attended twice since I waited so long) was a bit strange and I thought somewhat inappropriate, but most importantly, long-winded and slow, making it an unhelpful 3 hours of my workday  I think the orientation should be shortened by half with the emphasis on 1) do's and don't's during the cycle; and 2) a quick demonstration of how to administer the shots (not an endless one, as I experienced, since there are videos onlineI am surprised to see so few reviews here of this clinic   So I might have had higher expectations for this place, having not been in a situation where I felt that I had no other options  One of the best doctors I've ever worked with  If I had once piece of feedback for this place, it would be to please only hire people with a decent bedside manner, especially those who work directly with patients  Sometimes it felt like they were taking the ""care"" out of medical careThe good stuff is: they know what they are doing, and I believe they are actually one of the clinics who helped make this whole field in the first place)Another ""good"" thing, if you can call it that, is that the injections that you give yourself - that you will dread - are really no bigs!  You can just watch the training videos a bunch of times til you feel comfortable doing it (that's what I did)  They put you in what they call, and I am not kidding, ""twilight sedation"", which is great  The sedation is awesome  It is all the stuff Michael Jackson was into :)  My recovery was also no bigs at all - can't say that I had any issues with that Everyone here is efficient and kind They often remember you (not sure how when they see hundreds of patients), and I've never felt unwelcome or rushed Not only am I confident they are doing everything I need medically, but I feel genuinely cared for by nursing staff when I'm there   We decided to travel to New York and try NYU because they have one of the highest success rates in the world  Our first clinic was definitely giving more emotional type support to their clients, but that got us no where in the end  NYU is the best at what they doThank you to the entire NYU team for not giving up on us when everyone else did!  We are very thankful But the doctors don't really pay you much attention, literally running from room to room every morning I've heard other places are similar- ie feels like a factory- so I'm not sure if this is standard for large hospitals that have good reputation for fertility treatmentThis is an excellent fertility center The place is super-organized, morning monitoring is really efficient and quick (unlike, say, Columbia)  In the recovery room after the retrieval procedure, the nurses were making fun of on of the patient's who was experiencing hallucinations after the anesthesia",5.0
52,NYU Langone Fertility Center,Clinic,Negative,"This review comes perhaps after 19 years, as at the time there was no internet I was cursing the center's name during my first injection as I felt that they could have done more to prepare me In my case, they charged me their cash rate and it took me 4 months and hours of my time to get them to refund the overcharge (the difference between the cash rate and the insurance-negotiated rate that I should have paid)Administrative support here was probably the worst part of this clinic Was frustrating to schedule appointments and get questions answered by the nurses  No reason to mess up your cycle because you forgot a vial or took the wrong meds I did not accept Tylenol and felt like I had very bad cramps for the rest of the day but they improved by day 2 I suspect that this is the norm and so want to emphasize it since most boards are filled with negative experiences  I was *extremely* frustrated by this and consider it a huge fault of NYU that they did not inform us of this possibility (there was ample time for my husband to come back to provide more specimens)  On the negative side: the front office is extremely disorganized (don't discount other reviews about this; be vigilant about your paperwork and double check everything!) They don't really care about your financial and don't listen when you point out their mistakesI really can't say anything positive  They make an already very stressful process really more as stressful as possible and they just don't seem to care Many of the rest don't even have direct phone numbers - so it is sort of a ridiculous joke trying to reach people at various critical stages  I was annoyed when I realized this, but I can't say I was surprisedOne of the nurses (there are three) was troubled by my questions related to potential medical risks for donors, and expressed this There's also no online portal to check your own labs And when we contact the billing center to discuss (more than 10 times at this point), they claim there is some secret ""Accounts Receivable"" person who makes all the decisions who we are not allowed to talk to directly NYU Fertility Center is inhumane and really unpleasant to deal with The most difficult part of the process is the first time you come home with all the prescriptions and needles and you have to inject yourself for the first time  Their default start of conversation is always to ask ""did you speak with billing?""  I've learned that if you press them, sometimes they will actually  look in your chart and see that there really is no need to speak with billing But, If I had waited, I would have missed that month's window  I've at various times waited two hours to be seen during morning monitoring - and double checked to see if my name had been called - have been told no, it hadn't, and then upon seeing the nurse, have been told that i was called earlier Unfortunately, it seems that the staff does not communicate very well   It's very stressful When i called Recombine, they told me they could reduce the payment, but refused to issue a new bill for me stating this They in the end explained how the lab was not ready that day, and they didn't know till that morning  * Terrible internal communication between the NYU staff (physicians and nurses) as I was repeatedly told erroneous or conflicting information/guidance  Such a shame they can't treat their patients betterWe've been around the block to different centers, and the people here are the absolute top  After that, you sign up for one of their egg freeze ""orientations,"" which is a 2-3 hour presentation by a nurse about the details of the process (this was probably the weakest link in the experience, more on that below  This was no issue as Apthorp will deliver same day, even when you call late afternoon  The day of the retrieval, plan to spend 3 hours at the place -- an hour to change/talk to the anesthesiologist/wait around, 10-15 minutes for the procedure, and about 45 mins to an hour of recovery, where they give you water and crackers, and maybe pain meds if you need them for cramps I thought it was long and drawn out and filled with a lot of useless info (e They were beyond rude and horrendous to me  I had a few bad experiences with the staff, especially this super mean lady in the recovery room, OF ALL PLACES (when you are waking up from the anesthesia, from your procedure)  -- dang!  She was just super gruff and mean, and at one point just walked away while I was sitting alone and crying, during my intake for the procedure, when I was anxious and scared  I overheard a couple other ladies questioning their medicine doses and the timing of their procedures, and I just would caution against going down that roadThe other ""good"" thing, if you can call it that, is that the procedure, which I spent a lot of time dreading, it no bigs eitherSo, the bottom line for me is: this is a results-oriented medical clinic that will not hold your hand through any of thisI'm not a big poster, but I feel compelled to do so here - especially given some of these bad reviews If you have an emergency, leave a message via the call center and someone gets back you right away Very frustrating when you think that bill is paid and they hit you with another one out of nowhere So I called the NYU fertility billing office, of course they leave a voicemail at 5pm when they close Figure out a better system because this is unfair to your patients In the end the doctors and nurses all know what they are doing and you can trust them - but the communication is lacking and frustrating for a patient who has never gone through fertility treatment beforeSTAY AWAY FROM NYU! Horrible facility  My labs were sent to two different lab facilities on the same day and I was charged two co-pays, but nobody knew why they were sent to two facilities and why I was charged twice  I was not confident in my physician, I was not confident in her staff and I was not confident in the billingThe nurses gossip about the MDs constantly  The weekend nurses had made multiple mistakes regarding when I come in and when I take my medication The entire process was disappointing",5.0
53,NYU Langone Fertility Center,Clinic,Neutral," Here are a few points to consider:First, it is a factory but an organized one  You may see the same nurses during blood work, but often they are different Third, your doctor may not do the actual retrieval They seem to make up prices out of thin air Most places charge $0-35 for this, which literally involves just pulling your vials from storage Be aware!I also encountered issues with NYU's and specifically the anesthesiology department's billing practices Found out after the fact only a tiny 5 ft, 100 lb woman should be on a 2 Also did a saline sonogram here, and there were literally chunks of my cervix on the floor after because it took the Doc FOUR tries to get the speculum and catheter in properly They kept saying they were sent via mail, but after me calling every week for over a month the admin realized the folder had been sitting on a desk but never picked up  The surgical procedure itself was a breezeExperience at NYU Fertility Center in May 2018; I was 35 Process begins!  You show up for monitoring (blood draw + ultrasound) on day 2 of your period  The ultrasound was always done by a doctor (though not always *your* doctor) When you get there, it's a quick review of your medical history before setting you up on a surgical chair (w/ very high stirrups) This was told to me by 2 separate providers in this same practice  It's a factory Examples: Few of them have email address (at least that they will provide) The way this clinic is set this up, patients have access to second, third, and fourth opinions during their cycles This is when I myself started to get concerned I found out I was pregnant a couple days before my appointment at NYU They took blood for genetic carrier screening and many other things they didn't tell me about beforehand She said I had to return in a week for an ultrasound, although it would be too early to see a heartbeat, and I'd need another ultrasound the next week to look for a heartbeat This was the first I'd heard of this The nurse didn't wash her hands or use gloves to prep the ultrasound probe (and she touched door knobs and a trash can) The nurse said my blood from 1/20 wasn't run since the doctor saw what she needed on the ultrasound""Me: ""But I'm 6 weeks pregnant so what am I supposed to do?""Nurse: ""It's up to you The same nurse (I think) said that nurses don't look at patients' records when they call with test results I won't be going back, as the potential for great medical error with this system is alarming The invoices are jibberish, but they keep sending them to usAnd I've found that billing only returns calls about 1 out of 4 times  Several months ago, I was told that I had to speak with a particular person at billing before I had a procedure Others I've spoken with have also experienced it  I was previously tested at another place and that should have been enough Dr Berkeley will talk to you on the first day (and that's it), and after that, you will most likely only communicate with either nurses, coordinators, billing department, more nurses, and a 'day of' doctor But since they don't talk to each other, you are always told different story  The Doctors are amazing, but the customer service and billing/administration is so bad I would just go someplace else if I had to do it all over again  When you call you NEVER get the actual folks at NYU Fertility, it just goes to an answering service over and over again  The service says someone will call you back within 3 hours and that never, ever happens  You have to constantly follow-up  My husband and I got some tests done here and it was extremely expensive, even though the facility and lab were both in-networkNYU Fertility Center changed my life  (It's usually in 1-2 days, always in the mornings between 7-9 am)  Every morning you go in, they do bloodwork, and most often they will do an ultrasound also to check how you are responding to the stims  The nurse will call and tell you precisely when to take the trigger shot, as your procedure in the OR will be timed exactly to this time  In the mornings when I went in, I would usually arrive around 8 am, and I rarely had to wait more than 5-10 minutes  If you have questions in the process, you call the nurse's hotline and someone will call you back within 2-3 hours But, more so, their billing felt incredibly disorganized I have never experienced a more callous, money-hungry experience as a patient and would never return to this clinic again  (I suggest hooking up with someone who has been through it before and putting them on speed-dial on your phone)  They're not about that  They are tiny now They are very organized and know exactly where you are/what you need in every cycleAll and all my experience at this facility was mediocre She states that the $950 is extra and told me to call another department But they are busy and sometimes it takes a full day for them to get back to you which is nerve wracking when dealing with self administered scheduled shots Billing does not call you back unless you hound them Maybe a smaller facility will be more hands on but have less caregivers which may cause other issues  I have been to many different places and I have never seen a more disorganized place Everything is digital, and everyone is on board at all times  They seem to be just coasting through the process",5.0
54,NYU Langone Fertility Center,Protocol,Positive," Life Is full of surprises as now 19 years after, my daughter is a freshman at NYU! I think Dr Licciardi wanted to manage my expectations because he told me to expect 10-14 eggs, but 22 were retrieved and 20 mature eggs were frozen (age 36) What this actually means I really don't know because Dr Licciardi made it clear that there are no guarantees I'm going to do another cycle because more eggs = higher percentage of a positive outcome He changed my life! I emphatically recommend him!! In the end, I had much better results than the first time at another clinic due to the above attention to detail and correct adjustments to the meds made along the way She was prepared for our session, explained our options clearly, and was able to order the necessary tests to help us build our probe (that we eventually used for a successful pregnancy via IVF)  I am now one day post-op and have no pain at all Before starting I wish I knew: (a) you can't exercise during the protocol OR for another 10-14 days afterwards! (b) The process is a big deal I would have been pleased with this, except that they needed to use ICSI for fertilization' However - my main goal was to go through this process in safe hands and I felt that was the case with NYU[They also misrepresented the number of eggs they froze AND the number of embryos I produced (presumably so it my results would look/sound better) - luckily I switched facilities and my new Dr straightened this outI am writing this review 5 years after having my eggs frozen at NYU I just thawed and fertilized the eggs (at a different facility as I have moved) and had higher than average success rates 7 of the 9 eggs successfully thawed and 6 were successfully fertilized (They do freeze the immature eggs, but at the moment, there is no way to get a human egg to mature outside of the ovary Research is ongoing, so they freeze the immature eggs in hopes that fertility science has had some breakthroughs by the time the eggs are thawed for use My retrievals consistently went up under his careful monitoring and I didn't even do the acupuncture or yogaAs for having a whole team of doctors available:  this is so much better than going back to the same person over and over again She suggested because of irregular cycles I go straight to a fertility center for testing and potential medication They care for pregnancies up to 10 weeks, so I figured I'd stick with them in case of miscarriage I wish they'd told me which tests they were running, since many were repeats of tests I'd had done recently and have records for 1/5 - Went back, had the blood draw, got a call same-day to say that my hCG had doubled and my pregnancy was progressing well (Ok, so why am I here going through all these blood tests if we're not going to actually do anything? Progesterone supplementation is controversial, but it would have been nice to at least have been given the chance to discuss with my doctor""Me: ""Ok well it's too late for that now, and I can't get the vaccines because I'm pregnant My egg freezing procedure was successful and was seamless 2) My husband called 2 weeks prior (and I also wrote them an email) to confirm his appointment for providing his semen, and sure enough, they didn't have his name for that day  This was over six months ago and we are still trying to resolve it I did 6 cycles there and each one was fine-tuned to my response with each cycleI did one egg freeze cycle here and my review is based on that)  But overall, I'm extremely pleased with my experience and highly recommend NYU to anyone considering an egg freeze cycleI totally agree with the previous reviewer (G  He made an immediate connection with us and I really value that  I wanted to tattoo my name and date of birth on my forehead, from getting asked so many times  We didnt give up, but a few months later, our in-state fertility clinic dropped us after the 5th IVF because they couldn't figure out what was wrong  After learning a lot through our 6th IVF, we did another  2 IVFs with successful resultsI had 3 unsuccessful IUIs and one successful IVF frozen with PGD testing Only one embryo came back for implantation- but we have a healthy beautiful baby girl - now three weeks old The doctor who ended up giving the ultrasound asked why I came in so late In the end we are happy with our IVF baby girl and it was worth any aggravation we had at the time  She was pushing me to do a frozen embryo transfer, but I wanted a fresh cycle We did 4 IVF cycles at Columbia, had consultations and Cornell and at New Hope, and then found NYU NYU was sooooo much better than any of the above In particular, we loved Dr Keefe",5.0

Nearly TWO years after our last failed cycle, they STARTED sending us huge bills totalling many thousands of dollars These bills make NO sense, because NYU will not even give you treatment at the Fertility Center unless you pay EVERY CENT up front Avoid at all costs  This place is just EXTREMELY difficult to deal with I came in for my retrieval and they said they wouldn't do my retrieval unless I on-the-spot paid them $5k  After 4 unsuccessful IVFs with unexplained infertility, we were dropped by insurance who claimed our chances of having a baby were under 5% I'm 24 and have cancer, my oncologist referred me here because they give you a discounted rate to freeze your eggs ($6950 total) I paid the full amount, than 2 months after the whole process is over they send me another bill for $950 for anesthesia  We had some miscommunication with billing and our insurance which also was frustrating leaving the patient in the middle to sort it out  The bigger problem was billing  I was charged a co-pay for my visit even though I have full infertility coverage  My insurance told me that they paid 100% of the claim and that I should not have been charged",5.0

Even as we graduate to the absolutely perfect OB Dr Stein recommended, RMA continues to check in to see how baby and I are doingDr Buyuk was amazing! The whole staff is very helpful and professional Highly recommend But we had nothing but thoughtful care through many ups and downs and most importantly, we were successful Dr Sandler is a great person and, while I was anxious about everything, he made the energy of the whole process more bright and fun Dr Flisser always greeted me with a smile and took the time to answer our questions (and we had many!) as we went through each cycle Throughout the process I had full confidence in Dr Flisser's medical expertise and his varying approach to each cycle, and highly recommend him for IVFI had been struggling with a recent LEEP, PCOS, hypothyroidism and it seemed like the entire process of trying to get pregnant was filled with nothing but hurdles  Dr Stein made me feel at ease during our very first meeting and was very patient and supportive, answering all of my questions and reassuring me that they can provide the help that I needThanks to Dr Mukherjee I am now pregnant with our first little boy due this summer! We had a great experience at RMA & highly recommend Dr MukherjeeFrom our first appt, Dr Lawrence Grunfeld was realistic, highly educated, and had an excellent bedside mannerWhile I know success is never guaranteed, my husband and I were really losing hope after years of trying for a family Absolutely loved Clara, his nurse, she was really my link btw the doctor and me, if I wanted to try something new, she always brought it up to Dr Grunfeld You go in for a consultation were upon the physician promises you the world acts so positive and sucks you in to vortex of costly treatments The human touch would help when a woman is allowing a device inside of herDr Flisser at the RMA of NYC (Eastside) is fantastic! He's patient with his examinations and has a really calm demeanor which puts me at ease (unlike some other doctors who rush their patients through a 15 minute slot)Dr Murherjee was very professional, compassionate and knowledgeableI had a very positive experience at RMA Dr Beth McAvey and her team of nurses helped my husband and I fulfill our dream of children not once but twice It may be down to some luck but she was confident and knew what she was doing given our situation Highly recommendDr Copperman and Jordyn Banks, RN-BSN go above and beyond for their patients--super thorough, kind, responsive, and happy to explain anything Highly recommend! He's doing okay now, but the doctor he saw there (I can't remember his name) was much more interested in fixing the infertility than finding out what was causing it Furthermore, they were low-pressure and allowed me to explore as many options as I was comfortable with while helping me ground my decisions in statistics personalized to my situationI am thrilled to report that with their help I gave birth to a healthy baby girl this past month!  Thank you!! Yes, there are a lot of patients, but I still felt like I received one-on-one care and treatment He is the reason we have our 2 beautiful girls!Dr Sandler and the staff at the 60th street RMA clinic are exceptionally professional, welcoming and overall very caring It feels like the drs here see you coming with dollar signs in their eyesDr Copperman was real straightforward and resourceful in the information he provided me! Highly recommend him to anyone!My first experience at RMA was great largely due to the thorough, thoughtful, caring and informative care I received at the hands of Dr Leigh Rosen, M I left the office relieved and confident that I am receiving the very best treatment He is incredibly knowledgeable and my husband and I both agree that he is by far the best physician either of us have experienced in the city Highly recommend During my time there, I was treated kindly, well informed and truly, like a person I'd recommend Dr Lederman, Dr Klein, and the amazing Martha Fennessey to my family, friends, and strangers alikeMy first visit was very encouraging and I liked the doctor, who seemed knowledgeable and caring They talked to me a lot about getting ready to have twins because, you know, this was going to get me sooo pregnantWhen I was told to come in to see a doctor, the doctor said she was just there for an ultrasound and this was not a visit for talking about stuffAt first, I thought it was a really streamlined operation; then I felt like I was on an assembly line I felt like I was just money to themEveryone from front staff to clinical were super helpful & professional! Dr Flisser was super thorough & easy to talk to Dr Flisser saw me until my 8th week and was so nice and explained everythingMy husband and I had an amazing experience with RMA!  Dr Flisser was our doctor through the entire process  Dr Flisser and his staff were so helpful, always there to answer any questions I had Dr Copperman and his team were extremely responsive during my entire process - from my emails full of questions to showing up to lend their support on my transfer dayDr Flisser and his team are truly professional I asked the nurse to see Dr Flisser because I used to feel comfortable with him and he was doing the monitoring but he refused to see me  I found that at RMA everyone was sensitive to what we were going through and I had a great experience despite our circumstances I gave birth to a healthy baby boy at the end of January and am grateful to the science, medicine and consultation provided by Dr Grunfeld and his teamHaving been through many many cycles of IVF and having experienced a number of IVF Centers in NYC, I wanted to provide a review of my experience at RMA and with Dr Alan Copperman  We now have 3 beautiful children, all through working with Dr Copperman and RMAI found Dr Copperman to be caring, responsive and of course highly experienced and knowledgeable  I appreciated that he took time to listen to and address my questions/concerns and even suggestions, given that after multiple go's, I felt I knew how my body responded to certain medications and timingsSo all in all, I would strongly recommend Dr Copperman and RMA - we have referred a number of friends and are extremely grateful for what they were able to do for usWe had a wonderful experience with Dr Flisser and the whole team at RMA  Our appointments with Dr Flisser were great - he has a warm but serious demeanor and we felt very reassured   He is efficient, compassionate, thorough, and incredibly knowledgeable After hearing so many good things about Dr Flisser, I visited him with unique fertility concerns as well as severe chronic migraines (and medication to prevent them) that complicated my strong desire for a family  I left feeling secure in his treatment plan for me and absolutely confident that I had come to the right place  I was continually impressed and, honestly, astonished by how quickly and thoroughly Dr Flisser responds to questions and concerns  He truly makes every single patient feel like his priority--a feat, considering what must be an incredibly busy and demanding schedule  Truly, I have never felt so thoroughly cared for and confident in my doctor, nurses, and practice I spoke to a friend of the family who referred me to Kofinas fertility group in Methodist hospital  Between the packed waiting room where we had to stand because all the chairs were taken to the assembly line of blood work and ultrasound to sensitive test results being hastily left via voicemail without any explanation, to no subsequent follow up or call of any kind from the doctor, I decided I no longer wished to be a patient at RMA, as I had reached my limits with the factory approach to treatment, care and communication I had received, despite expending significant costs (both financial and emotional) throughout the process I am so grateful to Dr Flisser and the office staff for such a wonderful and smooth experience As someone who unfortunately has needed IVF treatments several times and gone through two different facilities and providers, RMANY has really been excellent  He is very  warm and makes you feel comfortable and heard as a patient going through an extremely anxiety-provoking time  My new Dr Laughed at his notes and apologized for the time wasted there  The day I walked into RMA is among the luckiest of my life  We were just fortunate enough to complete our family with our baby girl and I will never be able to thank Dr Copperman enough for creating my family Dr Flisser was very, kind, understanding, patient and thorough as our doctor I also felt very comfortable with himI absolutely loved Dr Stein's team and all the doctors I saw during monitoringDoctor Tanmoy Mukherjee  made my dreams come true! I cannot thank him enough on how much he changed me and my family's life! I will definitely recommend him to everyone  All my experiences in RMA had been mostly positive  I went for a consultation and I liked the dr I met, she was very kind and thorough (Dr Allison Styne) Klein in subsequent visits, and he had always been very caring and he takes initiative in asking if I had any questions The nurses were very responsive and Dr Davis was amazing:First of all, Dr Davis is a very kind and welcoming person, which is supper important in his field In addition, he is very resourceful, intelligent, patient and respectful All our questions were answered and we left the office very confident each timeDr Davis was also very responsive over email and helpful in any possible wayHighly recommend!!(2) you didn't?we are grateful every time we look at our rock star 3-year old, and are fully aware that Dr Flisser is to thank for him  Dr Flisser is extremely patient, thorough and has an excellent bedside manner  I never felt rushed and always felt like we were in good handsI had the most wonderful things to say about RMA in the beginning but to make a long story even longer:By by third IVF, and each time I emailed and met with my doctor, there was no answer as to what was going on (i STAY AWAY FROM THIS WAY OVER VALUED PLACE And if I ever wanted to speak directly with the dr, I didI had met many of the drs during the treatment and I liked mostI liked RMA to call us back to explain the results and progress, he called us back within an hour We loved working with Dr Mukherjee! I would definitely recommend RMA  :) Dr Dicken was on maternity leave for the first IUI, so Dr T performed the 1st one and Dr Wang did my second IUI, both were great!!!! Dr Dicken is amazing, as are Dr T & Dr Wang! Dr Dicken sat with us for over an hour in the initial consultation and revamped my medication regiment to focus on egg quality rather than quantity At least they removed the charge after we got our family friend who is a lawyer involved and threatened legal action  But Dr Copperman was ""my"" doctor and made what can be a difficult, emotional process so much easier  I genuinely felt like the whole staff was thrilled to see our success, and I cried on 'graduation day' when I was discharged (to, by the way, an OB who 'wasn't taking new patients' when I called until the doctor at RMA went above and beyond to get me in) Yes, Dr Klein is pretty good, but the whole experience is terrible No one ever really answered my questions enough to where I felt comfortable going forward Upon my initial consultation, Dr Flisser spent over an hour speaking to me about my medical history, walking through potential options to help with conception and the associated factors to be aware of Furthermore, he helped thoroughly explain what was happening at each stage pre-conception and during early pregnancy in an honest and realistic way Upon leaving RMA to transfer to a regular OB, Dr Flisser went to great lengths to help us find a doctor that would be just right for our needsI had a wonderful experience at RMA, specifically with Dr Copperman He is one of the most caring and knowledgeable doctors I have ever seen I saw him twice- for two different issues- and each time he remained calm, confident and reassuring I no way felt like I was a patient in a big practice Dr Copperman developed a personal relationship with me and made me feel like my case matteredDr Daniel Stein is a funny, kind, hard-working guy whom I really liked I think he is a great doctor, but his staff is not always great, and they are the ones who make the difference in the day-to-day experience there  Dr Mukherjee was an excellent dr who is extremely positive and personable without sugar coating things  While it's true that RMA is a very large practice that runs like a well-oiled machine, that was a positive in my book  Despite the largeness of the practice,i never had any trouble getting my questions answered or personal attention when neededDr Sandler is an honest, straight forward and an unbelievably smart doctor - there is no BS with him  He was an absolute godsend!  Me and my little family are graduating from RMA and I can honestly say, I do not want to leave! Thank you Dr Sandler you finally gave us our miracle(S)! Dr Grunfeld was fantastic! He's the kind of doc you know, knows his stuff and its very comforting! Whilst we ended up falling pregnant naturally anyway (one month away from starting treatments!) we felt very comfortable he would have gotten us over the line    I went from one of the kindest fertility clinics in the city, Sher Institute, to one of the most callous ones, RMA, because I needed to do donor eggs (Sher doesn't do that)  The whole donor process, under the best of circumstances, is highly emotional and undignified But after my last miscarriage (my second), my doctor simply said, ""Well, this happens and we have no reason to worry, so we'll have you talk to the nurse and we can start again  I saw Dr Sandler and loved him  I have read complaints about his bedside manner but I found the opposite to be true  He explained things clearly to me, was proactive, and was reassuring without making any false promises I was scheduled to go to Cornell and she strongly suggested I just call Dr Klein and see if he had any availability From the moment that I first met Dr Klein, he put my mind at ease and was so patient with my long list of questions and concerns I would actually look forward to going to see them! My husband also really felt this way about the staff and enjoyed going to the office I can never repay Dr Klein and his entire staff for not only helping me to get pregnant but for all the support along the way I needed a solid treatment plan, fast appointments (since I went either before work or during lunch hour), and responses to my emails/calls when needed  I absolutely LOVE Dr Mukherjee and feel more comfortable with him than my regular (female) OB  With their guidance and advice we faced the emotionally challenging process of IVF (with all the hormones and injections, yikes), and my wife is now 2 months pregnant From the time I entered the office I felt like a number",3.3376623376623376
64,RMA of New York,Doctor,Negative," I knew I could call the office and speak to a nurse at any time if I had a question or medical emergency For such a significant financial investment, I was frustrated that our wishes had been disregarded because it wasn't the ""typical protocol What really has become evident to me over these few months of reflection is the lack of tailoring of medication and treatment I am NOT a doctor, but the logic hit me and I would have at least appreciated having the discussion before the process began Also, it turns out our infertility was related to some very serious undiagnosed medical issues (liver failure) on my husband's part My husband was shocked to see the back of my hospital gown and legs soaked with blood because I drew the short straw and had a trainee dr do my egg retrieval Cannot express how grateful I am to have worked with him That alarmed me since I had so one to talk to about treatments and was finding a lot of info that I had questions about  We had even been to a different fertility clinic prior without any positive results During the appointment she offered a protocol that will never be successful with women of my age, her proposal to give me 300ml of gonal and 300 ml of menopur horrified two doctors to whom I went to get second opinion  I was spinning with several fears and questions even before starting the planning process, and Dr Flisser answered every single one I was so upset that the DrFlisser and the nurses gave me false hope and deceived me in such a sensitive time""  There was no further explanation, nor did I receive any call from the doctor or any subsequent follow up  Additionally, I had never been told of any outstanding issues (such as freezing of non-viable embryos) upon leaving the practice Not only is he so well knowledges but his bedside manner is impeccable  Dr Stein made have the worst anxiety because I never felt he was interested in making it happen with us Miscarriage after miscarriage is so upsetting She is very rude and condescending She made me second experience at RMA very unpleasant with her abrasive bedside manner Dr Copperman has awful bedside manner I had worst 2 week-recovery time after he conducted my retrieval My medical coordinator messed up a cycle leaving me waiting another month without even apologizing ""Sorry, we can't see you,"" the nurse told me coldly as my wife was bleeding and cramping Everyone who works there is so inappropriately dressed that it actually made me uncomfortable Horrible bedside manners We then met with kim, the ivf coordinator and permanent bitch face lady She seems like she hates being there She was horrible He responds promptly to emails and even called me on one late Sunday night because he knew I was discouraged He met with me and heard my questions, and was patient with my low-impact approachWe are incredibly happy that we are now pregnant, and Dr Stein is great; the billing/finance dept is really lacking, and the other staff is hit-or-miss, and makes an already-stressful experience worse than it has to be The only time I spoke with my Dr after 1st consult was when he 'couldn't proceed' because of a missing payment Today I am 8 weeks pregnant with twins!  We heard their healthy hearts beating and I forgot all about the 2 years of torture I dealt with before meeting Dr Sandler Waited twice for over an hour past my appointment time to see him to no avail   I never felt like a number and developed relationships with the nurses and my coordinator  This morning I saw a doctor for less than 60 seconds, and when i needed to ask him a question about a prescription, he cut me off and told me ""the nurse will handle it"" and out the door he wentDO NOT GO THERE, IT IS A FACTORY AND THERE IS NO CONTINUITY OF CARE",3.3376623376623376
65,RMA of New York,Doctor,Neutral," From the first meeting, his staff and colleagues told us everything we could expect from timelines and treatments all the way down to medicationsAfter so many years of infertility, I knew I would get pregnant with Dr Grunfeld and his team of nurses    I wish I had gone to RMA first instead of the other clinic where I wasted 3 months (and three IUIs) I actually commented on this ""factory feel"" while the Dr was in the room and a nurse mentioned that ""they were really trying to get away from that sense Often emails went unanswered and I would write back multiple times to get an answer I asked questions, asked them to show me what we were looking atand was never able to tell us why he was azoospermic In Australia, our urologist sat with both of us and talked about the male body, physiology, etc for about half an hour What she was able to tell us in one short session simplified and focused the process He and his staff were professional in doing weekly blood and ultrasound tests in the first 5 weeks of the pregnancy and would promptly respond to any questions He also took the time to answer all of our questionsDr Lekovich was phenomenalI saw Dr Copperman here (Jordyn Banks was his dedicated nurse/my contact) Dr Sandler and his nurses always answer all of our questions and they always follow up after every visit with next steps and results if any I was a patient of Dr F and cornered into doing 3 IVF treatments with him before realising that the treatments are not tailor made to my body I always felt that I received individualized attention throughout my time at RMA From the start of this whole process he has been accurate, thorough and professional I have yet to hear from my physician and I have called her three times I met with Dr Flisser, who was very understanding and explained his opinions and my options Every time I went in for a test, she would call me later in the day to tell me the results and then send me an email with the resultsDespite going through the ups and downs of infertility, Dr Copperman and his team were PHENOMENAL during the whole process  From our Doctor, Dr Grunfeld, and his team - front desk reception, nurses, coordinators billing department etc  (Retrievals are still done by doctor on duty given that it is highly time-sensitive)  He is always three steps ahead  Ariel, a nurse I worked with often, went above and beyond to answer my many questions, and to guide me through the day-to-day of fertility treatment and early pregnancySHE NEVER CALLS BACK   My doctor (Dr Flisser) called and spoke with my husband and I about my results  A few weeks later, I received a voicemail from a nurse letting me know the ""embryo was mosaic and not viable and to call her with any questions  As such, I called to request my medical records to be transferred to another fertility treatment center (CCRM)   At the time, I spoke to someone in your records department who asked why we were not continuing my treatment at RMA   We heard nothing further from RMA in this regardI began seeing Dr Flisser last summer as my husband and I were having issues conceiving naturally The waiting time was never over 10 min, and in each appointment we got his full attentionMy husband and I came here for or first ever ivf consult  I saw my actual Dr at consultation and one other time when he was doing the rounds  The Dr actually explains your situation comprehensively during consultation She is reachable by EMAIL and she, the Dr, responds! She thought is was one thing then another  My second experience was the total oppositeI was referred to a doctor at this practice for endocrinology and not for anything fertility based by my OBGYNIn the beginning of my fertility treatment, I felt that there was a bit of a factory feel to the practiceDr Mukherjee was my main Dr, and the Dr who oversaw all my treatments I'm shorting them one star because the billing is confusing as all hell, but ultimately after a long hard journey we had success due to the care and expertise of Dr Mukherjee and his team  I had questions, but the receptionist told me someone could speak to me when I donated the sperm  I had these done and my doctor faxed over the documents He was very patient in answering questions and very approachable First, let's talk about the waiting roomare u kidding me?? He barely looked at me and my husband and rushed us through the appt Dr Sandler called me back himself several times when I needed his consultation I felt as if switching to RMA was part of my journey  Dr Sandler and his team discussed the issues I was dealing with   He met with me a few times before we started the treatment "" No sympathy, no humanity, and worse, no thought, for a moment, that maybe we should change the way we're doing things instead of plowing aheadI started treatment at RMA in April 2014 at the Westchester office with Dr Jeff Klein, due to a recommendation from a friend, who had been to Cornell and had a terrible experience There was never a moment that I felt rushed or that I was asking too many questions I have never met a more compassionate and dedicated Dr and my husband absolutely agrees! The fact that he personally answers your emails and in an extremely timely manner is something that is very unheard of in this field Small side note - if you have PCOS and are slightly overweight and are absolutely sick and tired of every RE telling you to lose weight when you've been trying really hard to do just that - Dr Mukherjee is absolutely awesome in that respect  I had to ask multiple times to be checked out while each young woman tried passing me on to the next",3.3376623376623376
66,RMA of New York,Advice,Positive,"Great practice with a kind, knowledgable team What we liked about RMA might also be what some don't like about it Thanks Dr Sandler and team!!!! Thank you!!!! He and his nurses understand how grueling this journey can be and never let you lose sight of the end goal If you are reading this review, I wish I had known about this place much sooner Go see Dr Grunfeld so he can help you figure out how I'll  highly recommend RMA  to family and friends He is very patient and kind I highly recommend that anyone who is having infertility issues go to him He is definitely worth the visitHad a good experience here with Dr Flisser Which is what we were asking them to do, so I can't really be upset, but it would have been nice if they insisted he see a specialist to figure out what was going on with his health Anyway, we love our perfect baby and hope to return again when the time is right What I appreciate is that before they begin any exam, discuss details about next steps in person or draw any blood, they have us verify the name and DOB to ensure it's the correct patient I would recommend this clinic to any family or friendIf you want to feel like a battery farm hen then this is the place for you Good luck if you decide to go with RMA! Now that I know what it feels like to have an elite doctor and 5 star service, I'm NEVER settling for less again THANK YOU for restoring my faith in the medical community And I HIGHLY recommend Dr Flisser He has a calm demeanor to him and no question is too crazy He successfully got us pregnant after the first transfer!  I'll be back for #2 without a doubtMy wife and I had a great experience with RMA I am truly, truly upset  I'm successfully and happily pregnant but honestly wish I could ride out my entire pregnancy at this office Do your own research on effectiveness, side effects, number of times it is advisable to have certain treatments, etc  I wish you the best of luck wherever you decide to go! Was a pleasure meeting & treating with him  And we got pregnant after just one IUI!!  Amazing!!  If you are suffering from infertility, please visit RMA, please see Dr Flisser  His straight to the point style was definitely appreciated I found Dr Copperman to be very caring, knowledgeable and realistic She didn't bother to call me to reschedule 45 minutes later, I could have left work later if she had rescheduled Yes, he refused to see me saying he was too busy  But I will try to provide a holistic perspective of my experience there also - hopefully it might help others going through the process  My 5 star rating doesn't mean that the center is perfect, but I would strongly recommend it given my experience there and elsewhere  Would highly recommend RMA and Dr FlisserDr Flisser is the best of the best My husband and I are now thrilled to be expecting a healthy baby in three months, and I have Dr Flisser and RMA NY to thank  Thank you Dr Flisser, Ariel, and RMA NY Eastside  I'm going there tomorrow, and I pray that they work better than RMA   To be clear, I still have the recording of the 2017 voicemail and nowhere did the nurse say that RMA intended on freezing my embryo and that I needed to call her back to discuss it Dr Flisser has been an amazing providerFirst I'd like to add that the Doctor's at RMA are top notch, especially Dr SteinIf I could give Dr Copperman and his amazing team 100 stars, it would not be enough Dr Stein's nurses and coordinator are just amazing I hope this posts helps other people I know you get excited, but if you have to defer a cycle, just do itYou will be very happy with the service and results here  I would never recommend them and I advise everyone to carefully do their due diligence, even if a trusted Dr recommends themhow can I think about the wild range of reviews other than:(1) you love RMA if you got pregnant with a healthy baby (on the first try), orMy husband and I had an excellent experience with RMA  Dr Flisser's team is great as well, there is always a nurse or coordinator available to answer any questions you have throughout the processGo to Cornell- I've gone there and it is much more caring and professional Wish this nightmare will be over soon  It is a true group practice, where you see many drs and you are communicating more with the nurses than the Dr during treatment  He is fantastic  It is important to be your own advocate in all medical decisions but it is also extremely important to go to the BEST DOCTORS, KNOW AND FEEL that you are in the best possible hands and TRUST them    I highly recommend RMA I wish I could give 4  Do your due diligence before seeking care at RMAIf I could give ZERO stars I would!! HORRIBLE!!! Talk about being treated like just another number!!! If you want to get pregnant & you're in NYC go to Sher with Dr T, Dr Dicken or Dr Wang!! They are the best!!! At the age of 36 and after trying for over a year and a half and after 2 IVFs, 1 FET transfer, & 4 IUIs, we finally discovered SherDr K still rains supreme  GO TO CORNELL MUCH BETTER!!!  Because I'm leaving for South America soon, where Zika is present, I wanted to get this done soonWould definitely recommend this organization! Please find another practice that values patient care over dollar signs But if u care abut ur self and want the best care that u deserve then go elsewhere His expertise and compassion can not be beat I highly recommend him and RMA He helped to find an OB/GYN even though I didn't have mine, and it was extremely difficult to make an appointment I would recommend Dr Sandler and his team to anyone thinking about reproduction assistance In my view, going with a practice that sees hundreds of patients each year and pools together the knowledge and expertise of a dozen or more expert doctors is exactly what I want  I could not possibly recommend a doctor more than I recommend Dr Sandler and his teamWhile I'd like to say positive things about this practice, the experience leaves a lot to be desired This practice is a money chasing practice that has long forgotten any morals or patient centered careI wish I could give this place a better review, having spent so much time and money here  RMA never recommended that I speak to a therapist or seek any kind of emotional counseling, despite the complicated situation involved with receiving donated eggs    I'm happy for the people that found success with RMA, and I suppose my review would be better if I didn't miscarry The next day, they were able to see me, which is so important if you know how timely fertility treatment is You can tell when you meet with him that he became a RE because he truly cares and will do whatever is in his power to help you I recommend them to anyone who will listen to me  That's exactly what I'm receiving from RMA and I'm very happy  But if you've been at this for a while and know the drill, this place will make you very happy/comfortable He simply trusts that you're doing your best, gives you a few suggestions (once!) and focuses on getting you pregnant rather than stuffed with kale and celery""   First of all, I am a doctor and I am quite certain and am very familiar with dosing instructions  If you are trying to get pregnant I highly recommend RMA of NY",3.3376623376623376

72,RMA of New York,Clinic,Positive," Covid interrupted our IVF process and they were great about sharing updates and keeping us informed  - particularly challenging given how little information was available anywhere! A particular word of praise is owed to the nursing staff who are always attentive and gracious The nurses and other physicians were also all so nice and really went the extra mile to make me feel comfortable and fully informed Even through the COVID-19 pandemic, the offices were able to stay open and went to great lengths to ensure every visit was as safe and sanitary as possible RMA is a huge practice with the best fertility specialists in the City - that means the best lab team, the best physicians and nurses, offices around the City, great facilities, and even a social worker for the emotional aspects of the journey A large practice with a huge volume of patients also means that there are very occasional issues with billing, call backs take a couple of hours, and the waiting room can get packed some mornings, if you come in on the later side I know the teams at CCRM and Cornell are wonderful too, but my husband and I recommend RMA without hesitationThey were fantastic, very clean, organized and fully equipped! Dr Sandler and his team is especially nice and efficient! My husband and I had a beautiful baby via IVF and can't be more happy about it Almost as important were his team who worked with me on scheduling and communication on everything from ordering medication to dosages Anyone who has been through this knows how organizationally complex it can be, and Flisser's team were on top of everythingRMA has been absolutely amazing They have been very helpful, understanding, caring and patient This process can be very long and taxing but the team at RMA helps you get through the process with their attentiveness to your needsI also like this practice because they have morning monitoring hours--from 7am to 8:30am you can walk in without making an appointment and still get to work on timeMy wife and I feel very good in this place where they really help you and explain you step by step, thanks to Dr Carlos Hernandez Nieto who made us feel that we are in very good hands Although not every visit was the news we had wanted, their nurses offered so much physical and emotional support as we were going through IVF which was draining and felt like it was going nowhere Although no one wants to pay for fertility ;) their finance team was also great! I never had to call insurance to fight a bill, as everything was explained in detail to me by the team Although an emotional and physical journey, I would come back to this place in a heartbeat Good luck to all of you  hang in there! I hope it works out for all of you The office operates like a well oiled machine, excellent if you are working, I was never there more than 1hr (and that's on a really busy morning) Everyone is very nice from the nurses to the finance team Good luck getting a phone call having someone follow up with you, there is a general number you call were you are placed on hold for a while until they decided to respond everything is put into a computer which leads to many errors and things being incredibly disorganized and there are huge mistakes made in the process however, they will never give it a second glance nor does anyone care to there is a huge cover up system in place when you need your records there is a two week waiting period to have a 15 They get results or positive pregnancies due to volume of around 500+ woman at any given time,however i would not be surprised at all if they artificially inflated the numbers to lure vulnerable women into that place!Your larger desk staff were difficult to engage and generally lacked warmth The Doctors are very good with qualified nurses ready to help any time you call  We are now pregnant and just discharged today!  Very happy customers  His team and the faculty at RMANY is professional, punctual, always smiling, and easy to reach  It was always easy to get in touch with billing with our many questions  This place is busy, especially east side - but don't mistake it for a haphazard baby factory  They truly are the #1 place for fertility issues and I trusted them implicitly They run a busy office but I always felt taken care of and supported I have had many friends go through IVF and the full waiting room is something that comes along with the territory no matter where you go, for the most part I hope somebody has the guts to file a lawsuit, they should be closed down! Please allow me the massive privilege of commenting exclusively on the monitoring experience provided by this RMA location, nothing else Process: Monitoring is clearly done in large batches, but is executed very efficiently There are usually a good 20 women in the waiting room, which plays upbeat pop, has strong WiFi, and offers lots of recent magazines One could comfortably wait quite a while here, but 25 minutes is the maximum I sat through  Pretty impressive! Also explains the sobering 7-8:30 a Personnel: So happy to find that the majority of the staff here are female The nurses are sensitive to the toils of regular blood-testing and gently ask which arm you prefer; the front-desk staff always wish clients a good morning OBGYNs themselves have been a little cold and brief, but never rude Being treated well at 7 a Perhaps it was the lack of stress, the comforting staff, and the manageable time commitment that supported my eventual 40-egg retrieval We have a 9-month-old now after a very very difficult process--but RMA was as helpful and caring as they could be under the circumstances  Both were highly responsive and patient with me as I made decisions and dealt with any setbacksLastly, they were very hands on in helping me navigate my insuranceRMA of NYC (eastside) made my husband and I parents - twice!! The team of doctors and nurses were exceptionally knowledgeable and kind IVF can be a scary time but they always answered all of my (MANY) questions and walked me through each step of the process in great detail We have had a positive experience with the clinic overallI had an excellent experience at RMA The staff at RMA made the whole IVF process as simple as it can be with their organization, resources, and support Some may say that they feel like a number because there are so many patients but it's NYC and that is to be expected Every single staff member that I encountered was wonderful from billing, to coordinators, to nurses, to phlebotomists, to the doctorsEveryone was very helpful and the whole clinic is very LGBT friendly I was referred by a colleague and now would like to question exactly what they saw in this group RMA and it's staff (I mainly went to the Westchester offices except for a couple NYC visits and of course the major prucedures) were wonderful The staff cares and are sensitive to what individuals are going through In the end, as I just got discharged yesterday, it was kind of bittersweet to leave   Things like medical advice, next steps, procedures, side effects, timelines, effectiveness, risks just aren't discussed The nurses were also very sweet and seemed to actually care There is alot of emotion and stress that comes along with IVF, but I felt extremely cared for at RMAI highly recommend Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York The staff is professional, helpful and kind All of the office staff and doctors are knowledgeable and demonstrate that they really care! The entire practice is like a well oiled machine, highly efficient WOW!!! Extremely disappointed with his professionalismWhile RMA of NY was clearly a large facility, it felt like a well oiled machine with wonderful staff - everyone was extraordinarily helpful and friendly  I also like that at RMA, the process now is for your doctor to do the transfer rather than any doctor who is on dutyThe other things I appreciated about RMA are the efficiency with which the office is run and the competent staff  I like that they have a central coordinator for each patient who you can reach out to with any questions - again, other clinics did not have this and you had to deal with different nurses all the time, most of who had no idea who you were or your background  Given that you will be spending a LOT of time at the clinic for monitoring etc, it's also important that the clinic is efficiently run  While it's unavoidable that most clinics will be crowded, I was able to get in and out without having excessive delays by avoiding peak times (go early mornings!)  They do care how long you are waiting and try to avoid situations where you have to wait for very long periods of time - which is more than I can say for the other 2 clinics I have been to  We got pregnant on our first transfer cycle and had a great experience through being released from RMA  Keep up the awesome work!  The nurse calls me later in the day and says my blood work came back fine, but DrFlisser said I have a BMI of 45% and in needs to be below 40 % Rather, my issue with RMA which I feel the need to bring to everyone's attention is with the substandard and disappointing service and care I received  Yet another mess for us to clean up   I am posting my experience with the hopes that RMA take an extensive look at your staff, communication, and billing protocols    However, my doctors and the staff at CCRM in both New York and Colorado have made a challenging situation bearable while providing the quality of care and communication unlike anything I experienced at RMA Also, as someone from the medical field myself, I can appreciate the thoroughness and coordination of the office staff We will definitely be returning when we are ready for #2! Thank you to Dr Flisser, Ariel and the staff at RMA! Get past the overwhelming feeling during morning monitoring - the care I received really was amazing and I highly recommend RMA Eastside  They are interested in stats not helping you grow a family They are ALWAYS available, and truly on this ride with youWe were  very happy at RMA Eastside Rma have great staff always answered all my questions and always called to touch base with me to see how everything is going and they are very professionalI didn't do much research when my doctor recommanded a list of places for IVF, I chose RMA because it was one of the center of excellence for my health insurance company, and also it is easy for commute as I work in the city  I also recall looking up their numbers (successful rate) in the national database, and they looked good compare to others  They treat you like a number, not a personI attended the Broadway office which was very clean, the waiting time was never over 10 min and everything went smoothly That said, had I known to call off cycle, the office  would have - but since I'm going to experts, it would have been nice if they had been proactive and called off the cycleThe staff here is excellent You will find a very caring attention to detail at every interactionThe doctors here are some of the best and you will note the many times each has been noted for their excellence by the many awards for Top Doctors of the year The Dr took us through the whole process, did an ultrasound, made it all sound super easy and hopeful If RMA had done their due diligence we would have saved time and stress and heartache of thinking we couldn't afford to even try Feels like a factory, and with check in visits I've had experiences where the doctor on duty made mistakes that clearly indicated they hadn't read my file Some doctors are okay, but overall it's not a personal experience and you feel more like a number than a patient YOU MUST BE KIDDING ME !!!! YOU HAVE NO FREAKING DOCTORS !!! I literally see 7 listed on your business card !! Good luck to everyone out there still looking for an answer Looks like they were just looking to make money off of unsuspecting patients Walk in, walk out, like machines My first experience at RMA was greatWhy they even hired that kind of people 3 times false information in a row and charged $2,000 on my credit card without my consent which was ridiculous There's lots of better places in NYCRMA is like a high volume uncaring infertility factory who's primary focus is getting money from their desperate clients They treat their patients like patients, not like targets They treat people as a number for something so personal as fertility The only reason I come here is because my OBGYN respects this place, they have lots of traffic and see many cases, their stats are good! That said I wish I had the choice of another place Thanks to them I have 2 beautiful healthy babies  Also, in speaking with many other woman who go through fertility treatment in various clinics in NYC, I learned most of the popular ones have that factory feel as many woman need helpThe staff was great  They were respectful and comforting but I felt that ALL were smart, competent and trustworthy Their nurse called us back the same day after every test and clearly explained the next step and shots that were needed to be done This is very impressive They run it as a business which is fine with me I run a dental office myself so appreciate the organization and professionalismRMA definitely feels like a fertility factory and you won't always get the warm and fuzzies here, but they're on top of it! IVF is a confusing and overwhelming process I always felt I was in good hands here  The doctors and nurses are all so warm & make you feel so comfortable The doctors answer your emails even on the weekends and in the evenings!!  The front staff are great too Dr Azim was great BUT the lab that he uses (Gramercy IVF) has freezers that ruined our sperm quality which was excellent quality from a sperm bank We HIGHLY recommend Sher above all else!!! Don't walk away from RMA, RUN AWAY!!!!  For me, I was happy to be seen by doctors who do this all the time and whose office runs like a well-oiled machine  When I was too chicken to give myself a really simple injection that was meant to be administered at home, they were more than happy for me to bring it to them for a nurse to give me, and I was in and out in five minutes  Their doctors have great reputations but the office side of this operation needs a serious overhaul They acted like I should have already known all the steps in what is actually a pretty complicated processI am very grateful to the RMA staff and the various doctors that I worked with For me this was the most efficient way to get the care I needed Doctor Sandler, all the lab technicians and nurses were more than helpful They gave us bad advice regarding a rebate program (Compassionate Care) that could have saved us literally thousands of dollars  The nurses I worked with ranged from being sufficiently pleasant to totally amazing (with the majority being toward the amazing end of the spectrum) Bloodwork and other tests are turned around with amazing speed (which is necessary in this area of medicine) and although the crowds in the waiting room can be scary at times (esp on weekends) they move things along with surprising speed and efficiency This place is a joke We requested our medical records from the practice because we wanted someone closer to our home in Long Island to follow our care We've since found much more caring and attentive practices and now prefer seeing a doctor who actually will care for you! Difficult as it is to find these days, the effort is worth it They see a lot of patients and move fast as they are a busy place, so have your questions prepared in advance and you will do wellbut I have to agree with the others about it being a cold, emotionless place  It truly is like a factory I 100 percent agree with earlier reviewers who have claimed that it is a factory It is almost impossible to actually speak to a doctor, and while some nurses (Carrie) are great, most of the others seem like they rented their lab coats from a costume shop I never receive any kind of cost breakdown for the services, and am just supposed to trust that their numbers are rightI wish that there were other options out there for womenI've been going here since July 2013 and tried to keep an open mind, but for a practice that handles such important and sensitive work, I've been really disappointed at the complete lack of compassion and care The place is run like a factory - efficient yes, but cold Nurses and doctors alike just want to get you in and out The nurses who have helped me have been mediocre, at best I'm sure this place has been great for many people, but I would not recommend them to any of my friends and felt like I owed it to other women to write this review  Going through a process that is so sensitive this place should feel welcoming but it's notI think the NY office of RMA is amazing  I always felt like I was in excellent hands, even at the time when things were not looking good for us Going through IVF is an emotional roller coaster and I found the staff to be as pleasant and helpful as possible The RN staff is very friendly and always follows up and I can simply request an appointment with Dr M to go over options You mean I was supposed to continue through last night?""  With the snootiest of tones she said ""Well that must've been a misinterpretation on YOUR part  Further, the original plan of taking the injection for 3 nights, skipping a night, then coming in 36 hours later for ultrasound/labs didnt make sense such that I called the office BACK to ensure those were the instructions, They were repeated to me in the same way, so that's what I didThe doctors might have good reputations  But, their customer service responses were often slow and less responsive  Every time I received IUI, I was allowed to stay there only 10 minutes and I always felt as if was rushed out While checking out at the NYC office the receptionist were laughing with one another and socializing When I kindly asked for a supervisor I was asked what do you mean a supervisor? We don't have a supervisor I don't think the office workers realize that they are there to help PATIENTS not customers",3.3376623376623376
73,RMA of New York,Clinic,Negative,"I can't say enough good things about our experience at RMA The financial coordinators also worked so hard for weeks to find every possible way to cut down the costs of treatment, and also responded to all of our questions nearly instantly Absolutely no corners were cut before and during the pandemic- the team was so incredibly thorough conducting every possible test and taking every possible precaution throughout all treatments While we know many couples do not have the same success as us so quickly, I cannot imagine a more positive, compassionate, and personally involved team to help start our family  If you arrive right at 7am there's rarely a wait and I loved how convenient it was, especially with the frequency of getting blood drawn and testingI can't say enough great things about how efficient this place is run and the quality of their staff and doctors There were many tears and feelings of depression that this would never happen for usIf i could give this facility a negative review I would; just to warn people about the abuses that go on in facility towards their paying clients00 and hour techs and you are ignored as are your needs  Your physician does not typically work with you after the consultation there are doctors who deal with the hundreds of cycling patients so its a crap shoot essentially (you may get a decent doctor you may not they dont care at all)00 an hour tech go through everything to make sure the info is accurate and even after the two week you still have to wait and call and harass the one number there is to call The only part of RMA that actually knows what they are doing unfortunately is the finance team Im surprised no one has ever called them out on their abusive practices or how they havent been exposed for the scam they are  Some people may not like that you see different doctors for monitoring while in cycle; I personally didn't mind because the office is very efficient and I was usually in and out of monitoring in ~30 minutes or less It is here in the initial experience that much is lost Sometimes the answers were rude and dismissiveno talking, no explanation of what they were looking for, just clicking on the screen and taking measurementsI wrote an email and came in to the office to talk about my frustration It may be important for your team to be aware that intramuscular injections at the top of the bum are no longer allowed in Australia, even for doctor's to administer in this area, due to it's proximity to the sciatic nerve The risk of damage is obviously much higher when untrained patients like me are asked to self administer with no discussion or warning of the sciatic nerve risks I can not thank them enough If I didn't feel comfortable with something they were eager to rectify the issue   Can't imagine a way to have improved this experienceThe only complaint that I had was that they use SS#'s to verify patients UNLESS you ask for a temporary number to replace your SS# This is a very sensitive subject in any couple, woman or mans life and they make it stressful and confusingFertility struggles, I've learned, are one of the most stressful experiences to have to endureThis place is too chaotic and gave me anxiety  This means that if you choose to do PGD, it is a very smooth process - whereas at another center, they outsourced this and it required additional administration and processes and altogether did not inspire confidence  They now also have a text survey which enables you to tell them when the wait time is unacceptable and also provide other feedback as soon as your visit is over  No question was too small or silly They never sent it, but not a problem I have to go in for bloodwork the next morning The nurses and Doctor out right LIED to me I was at work fighting back tears and got so depressed  We told them of the voicemail results mentioned above, and that we were unhappy with the service/communication protocols, and that we were taking our business elsewhere  When I tried to call billing and ask for questions, the staff were clueless and had an attitude  It's a shame because the Doctor's at RMA are top notch, the rest of the staff are below standard  I started off at another clinic and had the coldest, most traumatizing experience where I was treated as a number not a person  I have emailed them the most ridiculous questions, cried to them numerous times, and have gotten nothing but the utmost care, support and love in return  This whole journey will never be easy, but working with the people at RMA make it bearable After a bad experience at another clinic I felt very cared for at RMA  One negative comment is that on the day of extraction, I had a reaction to the anesthesia (which I found out more when I delivered my baby), they rushed me out pretty quickly, I was one of the last patient for the day I think  On the way back, I felt horrible, but it didn't affect the results thank goodnessThis place is awful!!! DO NOT GO HERE FOR FERTILITY TREATMENTS!!  I made the mistake of doing so and I deeply regret it!  They are horrible to deal with in every way shape and form!!   They DO NOT care about their patients, they only care about $$$$ We felt totally duped  The other Drs seem fine but one very old technician and nurses were awful and major attitude considering how much you payI was referred by my ObGyn to this office and when I called RMA office to schedule an appointment with a doctor for an initial consult and a possible ultrasound for a pain I have been experiencing!! THE RECEPTIONIST TOLD ME THEY HAVE NO ONE AND JUST HUNG UP THE PHONE!!!  I feel the pain of every couple who is suffering through IVF, and particularly those who did not have success as we did 2 years ago I was angry the first time, but figured there might have been a technical glitch where they confused me with another patientI can only feel terrible for those trying to conceive and what they might be billed at this office or if they are confusing patients regularly with their records They billed me incorrectly for $13,000 for procedures done 10 months before and failed to correct the error- despite me contacting the insurance company and providing them with necessary documentation to correct the errorDespite making millions from their patients, their computers have gone down for 8 hours at a time and they provide horrible customer serviceThe worst clinic as just as big as the big hospitalsVery impersonalUnfortunately I have been in the ivf business for 5 years and this is my second time around as we are trying for baby number 2 This is by far the worst clinic I have visited for so many reasons- they are greedy, try to over charge you for everything hate this place so much We had horrible experience at Cornell where the nurse would not call you back for 2 weeks with results and forget about a doctor They are not touchy feely, but I didn't care about that as long as they knew what they were doing We had such a bad experience at RMA We spent over $7k at RMA even though they had claimed to be in network!!! What a waste of $! They also charged us $3,500 for ICI without our permission & when we didn't even need it!!! We had an extra vial of sperm being stored there and they could have used that one instead of doing ICSI without our permission  When you're going through the process, you get to know all the doctors depending on what day you need to come in, and there wasn't anyone I met who I didn't like  I understand that for some women, the crowded waiting rooms and ""cattle call"" feel of the early morning monitoring hours might not be ideal  I wasn't a patient long enough to really get to know any of the nursing staff -- but I can't think of a better compliment to a fertility clinic than ""I wasn't there long enough to be able to commentSad to say it, but here's another negative review  I asked them to look harder  Then I went to the office for my appt and they'd lost the fax again! After more conversation they then found it again  So I contacted another facility (with better reviews than this one) and they told me that donors need to have no sexual activity for no less than two days and no more than five for the best donationtl:dr: This place has decent doctors but terrible communication and awful staff I think the ladies at the front desk disliked me because I asked questions the first time I was in I started stressing b/c they tell you they need it within an hour I had a ""IVF class"" with one of the nurses and man, she was AWFUL Their billing practices are also extremely suspect I caught a double billing and now don't trust any of what they've sent meAbsolutely awful But two weeks after they discharged us and my wife was evidently losing our baby, they couldn't have cared less Shame on this horrible place I am very disappointed by this officeI got the impression that  They do not care for their patients, they have made many mistakes with my ivf medications  , the ivf coordinator almost never returns my calls, which messed my cycle completely and they lie to cover their mistakes instead to apologize and move onI find it very difficult to comunicate with staff ,  i constantly have the ""factory feeling "" I would never return to RMA despite the fact they they have great physicians  The ebst was when a women dressed to go to gym(a nurse) walked over to the girl next to me and started discussing how her treatment failed Overall bad experienceAs many people here I had an issue with the financial department: they messed up in the very beginning I was shocked of course, but decided to countercheck: obviously they called the wrong place, and therefore got wrong informationUnderwhelming experience, highly disorganized and no one is on top of anything Their finance dept was totally confusing, and once you get into the whole IVF thing, FINANCE is a big big deal That was a really bad moment that was really stressfulAfter a brief experience at RMA, I decided that their practice was not for me and gladly found the care I was looking for elsewhere Horrible staff (except nurses) Set me back months! Feels terrible going to a place where the people who are supposed to care for you at such an important time just want to take your money and remind you of this fact in their medical neglect and alternately omnipresent collections Having a fancy office in a fancy Manhattan location does not make for a good practice This practice did not send any records after multiple requests over the phone and in writing! Comically, a large packet showed up almost a YEAR later when we'd forgotten everything about it along with a bill for $79 We declined to pay saying that at that point there was no need for the records, we had to repeat several tests and they had been woefully inadequate in responding to our original request  BUT there is no excuse for the staff's cold demeanor and their failure to treat patients as a human being I have found that every woman is pushed through the same process, given the same advice and has the same plan, regardless of the fact that many of us are there in the first place because we have serious medical issues that demand attentionI also find it enraging that they cannot print and mail me an itemized bill like a human being, and instead announce in front of the entire waiting room how much I owe To date I have had the nurses forget to refer my follow-up questions to the doctor on four separate occasions, give me contrary instructions about when to have intercourse after taking FSH drugs, and screw up an important prescription (first forgot to call it in and then, because it was after hours and I needed the injection that night, made me race around town to get to a pharmacy that has the drug and pay out of pocket, because that pharmacy was not within my insurance's coverage, but it was the only place I could get the drug, or I would have had to waste another cycle of eggs) The doctors who see you when you come in for monitoring are just rushing to get to the next patient, so they offer little to no information unless you ask a million questions and even then, will try very hard to palm you off on the nurse if they canIt is unbelievable how bad the white plains office is being run They are unorganized, no customer service They have good and bad days but mostly bad Walking through such an emotional, physical, and financial process is really difficultI understand why people would write negative reviews because it really isn't a place where you get your hand held Yes, if you are JUST finding out about your infertility and want a place where you can cry it out after a failed attempt (believe me, I've been there) - this won't be the perfect place  Later, when I spoke with the nurse and told her that there had been multiple screw-ups with sending my Rx to my insurance company to get filled, she hands me a new Rx and tells me ""why don't you just take it to a local pharmacy and if you have to just pay out of pocket, it's not going to break the bank, it's only $128I have NO stars to give this doctor office Unfortunately I have nothing good to say For a practice that handles such sensitive work I am SO disappointed with the lack of compassion in the receptionists and the whole office There is no follow up, there is no returned calls Completely ignoring me as if they were a clerk in a supermarket Just awful! And to get your medical records forwarded I would live to speak with a supervisor of the NYC location and notify the doctors of my disappointment in the way that the office is run",3.3376623376623376
74,RMA of New York,Clinic,Neutral," Don't let that full waiting room turn you off, there are so many of us in the same boat They move through the crowd rather quickly Before discovering RMA, we were at another fertility clinic Our old place also chewed up hours of my busy work schedule The convenience of monitoring hours and their fast paced staff, makes RMA seamless We were a teamother times they were notWhen I arrived for my scans and blood work, often times a doctor would come in, state their name and immediately begin the ultrasoundFor over the 10 years I have been trying to have children with several failed IVF, I pray that God answer my prayer through RMA The receptionists do the work of finding your orders, informing the medical staff, and printing your labels so that you should never have to explain ""why you're in today"" All you do is print your first name on a sheet at the front desk and wait to be called Results from the morning are provided by 3 p every afternoon clinic hours I feel that shouldn't be available for all their staff to see when you call etc, and Florence M I was able to voice any feelings, concerns and questions and anything I needed was provided Nurses who seemed really overworked since they would only talk for moments at a time, literally MOMENTS at a time They would tell me, ""come in for ultrasound"" or ""get this drug"", ""have sex tomorrow"" This is the only interaction I had with people I had started getting information by reading the websites of other fertility clinics I called and the appointment was scheduled for within the week (rare for specialists) He ordered a million tests first and the nurse walked me through how to schedule and when I had an appointment with her on April 17, 2019 She was 45 minutes late for the appointment  My experience at other clinics is that they just kept trying more of the same even when things weren't workingRMA also has seamless coordination with its lab, which I did not find to be the case at other centers  I called the pharmacy twice that day to see if they sent the clomid  I sent a version of this letter to ALL of the other doctors at RMA and have never received a response  The rest of their staff however, specifically billing is below standard  They also hardly answer their phoneThis place caused many sleepless nights  I later found out that Dr Copperman fought for my insurance company which represents city workers (teachers, firefighters, police officers) because he believed that those people deserved the support Because they have several offices, I was able to go to a more convenient location except for when I needed to see my specific doctor which is a major plus for me They are some of the most sought after doctors and staff in the New York metro area  We were probably there for 2 hours It was only after going to another clinic that we found out ivf was indeed covered by our insurance and that all I needed was a letter of medical necessity due to male infertility This place is a factory, move onIn the past two years, on  at least three different occasions they billed me for services and fertility treatments I never had on dates I never even went to their office But RMA can bill for them- so they advocate for them and do them And they have done the same thing to many other patients (read the other reviews on yelp) Drs are good but the staff is irresponsible, often overbook appointments and you end up waiting forever  I felt they were rooting for me every step of the way  Every dr has a different doctoring style, so some personalities and styles meshed more with my needs Very organized and professional Was on upper east side but I went to Soho office for daily monitoring Also, Saturday monitoring wait is a bit long and I don't think I needed as many blood test as I did  They are not accommodating and overcrowded  DO NOT GO  Every single phone call of mine was returned promptly by the nurses the same day that I called, even on the weekends""  I was pregnant within 10 weeks of my first appointment  It wasn't a particularly touchy-feely experience, but I wasn't looking for touchy-feely, I was looking to get pregnant They said I needed a referral from my doctor and blood tests for infectious diseases  I called over and they said they never received them Called me own doctor who confirmed they were faxed Called them back and they said they didn't have them  They did and found the fax So when I came in for an IUI, they didn't tell the nurse that I was there and I had the sample for a LONG timeWhen working with the team at RMA, I found that I always received prompt attention, whether that be on the phone (weekday and even on weekends), when speaking with nurses and being seen They were always reliable in calling back with results when they said they wouldThis  review is only for the office staff not the physicansI went here last week for a consultation and it was truly  an awful experience Very confidentialoh they also made a women with a child move to a different waiting room simply bcs she had a child and it wasn't rght to be around people without any After  a 45 minute wait I saw dr grunfeld If u want to feel like ur in a factory and don't want personal care, then by all means go here I have never seen such attentive medical stuff elsewhere Have to wait weeks for simple lab results email All you are is a person with a dollar sign attached and they will find ways to maximize whatever money they can get out of you From the nurse to the receptionist to billing They can't handle the patients they have now  There was one nurse I found cold, but she was absolutely the exception You're in and out and are not always seen by the doctor (although you are still largely seen by the same 3-4 people) The office is unorganized and it's impossible to get someone on the phone I have NEVER even posted a review on yelp",3.3376623376623376
75,RMA of New York,Protocol,Positive," Dr Stein and his practice came highly recommended from my husband's (MD) colleagues- and it's hard to argue with his amazing success rates! After months of trying to conceive unsuccessfully, and in light of my husband beginning chemotherapy and my history of endometriosis, Dr Stein went over all of our options in great detailWe are so grateful for Dr Flisser, Ariel Schnur, and the team at RMA for our healthy pregnancy - due May 2020 We thankfully had success in our second round of IVFChose RMA after researching their high success rates & we had success after one IVF cycle (about 5 months total start to finish) with Dr Stein After my egg retrieval, I was informed that all of my eggs had been fertilized because the sperm seemed good (even though it had yet to be examined) They used completely different medications, timing, etc and she had great results (8 eggs)I had 19 eggs under treatment, and was initially excited  We highly recommend Dr Stein and RMANY!!! I'm so happy that we went to RMA I can not recommend them enough I'm 41 and we where successful on our first IVF attempt with Dr Lekovich We are so glad we were recommended and chose Dr Lekovich I should have seen the warning signs when after my first successful IVF, he told me not to implant the embryo but to do a second round of IVF so I could bank embryos and freeze them (paying even more money to RMA)Is this a pill mill, but for fertility drugs?I didn't have a known fertility issue but was ready to start planning to conceive and was open to taking a treatment of some sort to speed things up I ended up getting pregnant on my own shortly after I left there, likely because I had a better sense of my ovulation cycle for which I can thank them I never felt pressured to do anything I did not want to do I highly recommend it! She overlooked measles and rubella bloodwork as well as hormones day 3 which i brought and that bloodwork was made on actual day 3 and on another day right before the appointment Back in 2015 he helped me conceive my first baby (which I'm very thankful ) This morning I went to RMA for an ultrasound because I'm currently having an ectopic pregnancy (from a frozen transfer with Dr Stein)  I highly recommend going to this practice!  While IVF is highly scientific, there is also an art/skill in the protocol and timings, and I felt that Dr Copperman took all of my history into regard and adjusted the protocols etc as we went through to try to deliver the best outcome, and even listened to my input The nurse told me over the phone she would send clomid to my pharmacy and I had to go the next day for bloodwork  to make sure my thyroid levels dropped She got pregnant with twins on the first try there, didn't have to lose weight (shes heavier than me) and has alot of medical issuesI am not writing this because I am unhappy with the unsuccessful results of my treatment over two IVF cycles; I came into the IVF process at almost 40 years old eyes wide open that it very well could not work Fast forward to almost a year later, when I received a voicemail from RMA letting me know that ""my free year of cryo preserve was up  I would highly recommend RMANY and Dr Flisser He saw us through a chemical pregnancy, an ectopic pregnancy, a break because of that ectopic pregnancy, and finally another pregnancy this past March! I am currently 26 weeks pregnant with a healthy baby boy  After 1 year of being bedridden and 2 surgeries my body was finally ready to have have kids Dr Klein who did my embryo transfer was also great I also froze my eggs so i will definitely go back for my second baby  I only used the service once (March 2013-May 2013), and we were very lucky to have a baby boy (now he is 9 months old and very healthy) I really wish I had known to cancel that cycle My TSH ideally would be below 2 We found a great IVF doc through Cornell and sticking with him  However, as I continued my treatment, I began to realize it is actually a well oiled machine  I truly believe I would not have babies right now had it not been for him and his expertise When we wanted the dr Overall I recommend to use them On the second IUI, we got a POSITIVE pregnancy result for the first time ever!!!!! I am only 4 weeks pregnant, but all seems to be going well I'm so happy that I was able to conceive!  I'm now in my second trimester and wouldn't hesitate to return if and when I decide to have more children I contacted them in order to have my sperm frozen (cryopreservation) for use with a donated egg & surrogate I almost did IVF and I'm so glad I didn't I'm glad I didn't They have done this 1 million times and this is why they have the success that they do After a year of IUIs, we ended up doing IVF and have been successful after the first try - hooray! There were some bumps in the road however The IVF coordinator was nice, but needed a lesson in controlled expectations: she told us three separate times that we were ""ready to go"" only to be told that day that our insurance hadn't approved us, or that the IVF lab was closed during the month that we were supposed to go through the process  After a recommendation from my friend and then another random recommendation from my mother's coworker   Their ""one size fits all"" approach to fertility patients probably cost me a pregnancy""  Oh, the one that I specifically ASKED about removing BEFORE we DID the embryo transfer?  Then, the IVF coordinator was basically like ""OK, time to try again, let's start getting you ready!""  No, thank you I wish that these doctors saw me as more than a uterus and a checkbook But after over a year of ttc and learning every possible treatment available for my condition (PCOS), I no longer needed my hand held  Also include acupuncture as well along with any fertility treatment",3.3376623376623376

The tests they did were very extensive and complete They rule out everything so you will get a diagnosis here if you need  one So it is not unique to this center There was a new batch of nurses who started working there a few months into our treatment They seemed unhappy at their job and definitely took it out on the patients We waited to start our treatment with the new doctor at Weill Cornell based on the insurance information which was provided to us by the Reproductive Center, only to find out that the new doctor doesn't take our insurance after all and is out of network However, they are still a fertility clinic so they will still send you giant billsUnlike most clinics, they don't do anything electronically, hence why you have to stalk your phone Or call them repeatedly There is not a lot of transparency in their processes After going to another center for a while I finally came across CRM Can't rave enough about them and I have other places to compare them tooMy doctor in Florida used to work at this office They said they would call me back It's been about 5 months and I haven't heard back I've decided I'll just see someone else When I got the EOB and bill, it said that the doctor was not an in-network doctor In all of this, the wait time at the place was an hour each time They call you everyday and write back immediately when you have questions  Everyone has their own experiences , and everyone is different  Not until I switched to RMA and a coordinator sat with me and I found out I just had to do mail away3 They took it once, and then a  few minutes later (while I was still there waiting for the u/s), said they had to take more blood They do not use Weil Connect (the rest of the Medical center does)- It's been a month since I'm waiting for my medical records Now they are saying they are waiting for a doctor's signature to release the recordsI had the same experience as the other reviewers I have given up on this place and am now looking for a different doctor You can only call between 9 and mid-afternoon for the assistants, otherwise it goes to the on-call answering service  My appointment was at 9:30 am, so first thing in the morning, but I sat in the waiting room until 10:30 am  When they finally called me, they gave no apology or explanation They do have state of the art facility and all ultrasounds are done by doctors",4.68

Why? I listen and went ahead spending thousands of dollars on medicines They retrieved 9 eggs and he suggested we put 3, but none of those took He also said that we probably need to go ahead with donor eggs  Why?  Because they cannot imagine how any single woman in her right mind would willingly attempt to conceive a child while she was single",4.68

105,CCRM Fertility New York,Doctor,Positive,"As pleasant as fertility treatment can be: an opinion shared by my wife and me Dr Knopman treated us thoughtfully, explaining things clearly and tweaking things as needed to make sure we had the best results She is warm, caring and so positive He explained things in great detail and at no point, I felt confused about the process or about the next steps As an academic myself, this was very important to me, as I knew I didn't have time to read all the relevant scientific literature on the protocols and procedures we were about to experienceDr Levine is very well connected and has amazing contacts in the NYC area I recommended Dr Levine to everything I knew was struggling with fertility (at other clinics)Dr Choi reviewI found Dr Choi through a friend's rave recommendation, and I echo them after our experience We had been through a lot by the time we came to CCRM, as I'm sure is true for many fertility patients But not only was she sympathetic to our situation and history, what hit me most was her determination to get to the bottom of it and optimism for putting us in the best possible position for a success But we always found comfort in her straight-forward way of explaining things, and felt empowered because we were getting all the facts And I am happy to report we are well into a healthy pregnancy (fingers crossed)! I can't say enough about the staff, who was so prompt answering our many many questions Dr Levine's approach is based on the individual needs of each patient not the standard cookie cutter protocol not to mention the lab quality is the absolute best Even though we were not living locally, we experienced the excellent communication from the entire staff and amazing support from Dr Levine himself We were able to achieve success in his care After 2 unsuccessful cycle with another facility I reached out to Dr Choi she is the best,  kind, compassionate and she take her time to listen and is very theral which we loved First try with her and here i am 12 weeks pregnant! Am so happy we have you in the infertility world It started out great, I met with Dr Levine in their beautiful office after being referred by one of his friends who he went to medical school with My initial  impression was that he was slightly arrogant but maybe he was entitled to be- I mean this guy has a really impressive background and I wanted him to be my doctor I reiterated the importance of me not being able to miss a meeting with my CEO and asked if she could at least find out what Dr Levine needed, if it was urgent or if there was anyone else, (perhaps a nurse) that I could speak to instead There are no words to express my gratitude to Dr Knopman She was truly amazing; a true expert in her field, took her time explaining every single detail Having a tight work schedule myself, I appreciated the fact that CCRM always took me in on time; that rarely happens in other practicesApologies in advance for the long review, but my experience with Dr Levine and CCRM was so wonderful it deserves an essay: I can't express exactly how nervous I was to begin fertility treatment with a specialist He treated me warmly and compassionately from the moment I stepped into his office He spent over an hour with me discussing not only my case history, but who I was a person, what I liked to do during my free time, how I had been feeling about my fertility issues, etc However, the point of this post is to emphasize how wonderful my experience was throughout my journey at CCRM (which I know would have continued to be wonderful if that first IUI had not been successful, and I needed to proceed to more invasive procedures): Let's start with Dr Levine, who is honestly the BEST He takes the time to chat and catch up, and we spent just as much time talking about different exercise classes we liked, restaurant recommendations, and LIFE as we did my fertility issues This may seem silly, but it really changed the dynamic of my treatment from negative to positive I looked forward to my appointments with Dr Levine because they were so fun, and I left feeling happy, confident, and taken care of as an individual I remember receiving a call from him at 8pm, 2 minutes after I had e-mailed, when he was clearly in the middle of a family dinner I will also never forget receiving a call from Dr Levine at 1pm on a Saturday, in between cycles, just to say ""Hey, how are you feeling about everything?"" Even better than Dr Levine? His nursing staff I know CCRM sees a lot of patients, but I was floored every time they recognized me and greeted me by name When I found out I was pregnant, everyone at CCRM was so genuinely happy for me, and I got so many different forms of congratulationsThank you, Dr Levine and CCRM for everything! The incredible, compassionate work you do is so important and means the world to patients like me Our doctor, Dr Levine was incredible throughout the whole process, answering all of our many questions, being accessible via email and phone, and explaining everything (which i wanted)  Throughout the process i  met all of the other doctors (Dr Choi, Dr Knopman, and Dr Talebian) and they were all wonderful and kind! Instantly impressed at our first appointment, Dr Levine had already thoroughly researched , highlighted and took notes on our case Before even talking with us, he'd already discovered i was misdiagnosed previously and didn't take lightly how easy my case looked on paper being ""young and healthy"" He makes you feel comfortable every step of the way Also, to note, while Dr Talebian was not the Doctor I met with on day one, she took great care in my case as well and treated me as one of her own  Dr Levine was always praising his team, because they deserve it! We don't know how we could've done this without them THANK YOU TO THE VERY BEST THERE IS!  Dr Levine is the kindest, most caring doctor I have meet with He truly treats you like a human being and not another number  Dr Levine truly GETS how hard this journey is and is emphatic and human to guide you not just through the medical but also the emotional and mental aspects We were treated with love and respect at every visit and each appointment was timely and accommodating  Dr Levine made miracles happen and we are so grateful for him and his staff I went from feeling like cattle at a fertility farm to customized personal attention, and most importantly, problem solving Most of all, Dr Choi is brilliant, willing to take the time to understand your medical history and answer every question you have, and genuinely cares about her patients She is hands down the best doctor I have ever had CCRM certainly deserves one and I am so surprised I am the first one I am a 35 year old woman that began thinking about freezing my eggs this summer I made an appointment at CCRM NY as a friend who visited their Colorado branch recommended it to me My friend insisted that the place really has to make me feel good and at ease, if I was going to choose it for this procedure Dr Talabean did my retrieval and I trust her implicitly She was extremely honest and also prepared me for the recovery I am a very ""difficult case"" infertility-wise, and my doctor (Dr Brian Levine) was incredibly persistent and attentive and kept trying different protocols until we finally started getting good results  After speaking with friends who had gone through the IVF process, I was advised how important it was to find a lab and doctor with the data to back up their results  My blood pressure was sky high!  But within minutes Dr Levine and his ENTIRE staff put me and my mother at ease  I could simply go on and on about the care and medical attention I received by Dr Levine and his team  What was one of the most anxiety filled experience of my life actually ended up being one filled with true warmth and caring and honestly I sort of miss going there and seeing everyone everyday :)  The last bit I want to mention is that if it were not for this experience I also would not have discovered another medical situation and with Dr Levine's care I have been able to get treatment and feel SO fortunate that to this day I can still email him DIRECTLY and he will get back to me with either a phone call or email within hours  Never in my life have I received the attention and care that Dr Levine and CCRM's entire staff providesI wish I could more emphatically recommend Dr Levine because honestly my experience at CCRM and the practice he runs has been life changing for me Everyone from the front desk receptionists, to the nurses, to Dr Levine, made you feel like you were entering their living room rather than a doctor's office He is extremely intelligent (goes without saying), caring, compassionate and highly invested in his patients One of the BEST things about Dr Levine is how incredibly communicative he is When our time was up with Dr Levine I was truly saddened! I strongly urge anyone seeking fertility treatment to see Dr Levine  Ultimately, I felt like CCRM treated me like a walking blank check, bolstering a fear of the unknown to get me to opt into an expensive, out of pocket elective procedure I simply wanted to learn more about (and would have agreed to if I felt they actually cared about me)  I waited over 30 minutes to meet with the doctor, who was curt, a little vague on why certain tests were needed but very decisive that the elective procedure was a must, and quick to shuttle me off to the start of at least 5 staff members I would meet during my time there  Cost aside, while I applaud CCRM's efficiency, the lack of given time to process, understand my options and why certain things were needed, and digest what was happening felt very wrong There was not a single instance where I doubted Dr Choi's skills: her medical care was considered, skillful, and assured  And while incredibly impressive, it is the kindness, care, decency, and humanity of how she does what she does that sets Dr Choi apart from her peers Dr Choi, the healer, is a sterling human being whose ability to gently explain every aspect of the fertility process to her patients; to soothe and sympathize with her patients; to take care of her patients' emotions as much as their bodies, is deeply moving She is also incredibly attentive, following up consistently throughout the entire process and making sure I didn't have any questions and that everything was ok and that I had everything I needDr Brian Levine is responsible for my 3 1/2 year old daughter Willa, and after trying for almost 2 years at Cornell, luck found me in his capable hands again!I can not explain how discouraged, frustrated and just down I felt after my experience at Cornell ( if I was lucky I saw my dr once or twice a cycle) (He even gave me his cell phone number) We saw Dr Levine and he was able to diagnose our issues and set a clear course of action He was always incredibly personable, energetic and available for any and all questions that arose And he was able to help us get pregnant, which is of course the reason we were there in the first place! The entire staff is amazing -- everyone was warm, welcoming and very attentive to your personal situation Dr Choi did numerous tests, she leaves no stone unturned, and helped us decided on the best possible plan of action to reach our goals After our first appointment, we left feeling calm and excited about the path we had chosen It is very clear that everyone at CCRM is passionate about helping people, no is ever in a bad mood! Dr Choi was always available to us whenever we had questions or concerns and truly enjoys her work She is honest but optimistic, which we found very refreshing Dr Janet Choi is professional, thorough, compassionate, patient and kind -- all the key ingredients to help hormonal women going through a process that is putting our most treasured organs at possible risk They made me feel known and cared for every step of the way My results were very successful and I believe it was due to the thoughtful care and great communication of the entire staff, led by Dr Choi Dr Levine was my doctor but all of the staff and doctors knew me by first name and always showed a genuine interest in my progress and care Even after being discharged to an OB, Dr Levine continued to answer my questions without hesitation and in a very timely fashion It clearly shows that he loves his job and is very passionate about his workDr Levine has been absolutely wonderful to work with (he's kind, funny, patient and wise beyond his years, he remembers very detail and always makes time for me when I need to ask him something, I feel safe under his care and blessed to have found him), as is Amanda in billing (helpful and full of knowledge, answering my endless questions and helping me understand both insurance and self-pay matters to figure out what's best for me), Plus all of the nurses (especially Ali who has been supportive and nurturing like a sister), and the receptionists (Stephanie's/Kate who brighten up the phone lines and office)There are no words to express how lucky I feel to have been a patient of Dr Knopman and at CCRM Although I was at CCRM during a very difficult time in my life, the optimism, patience, compassion and kindness expressed by everyone there helped get me through it In particular, Dr Knopman was truly amazing and went above and beyond what I could expect from any doctor  At each step along the way, Dr Knopman was there to help me and to guide me through  Dr Knopman shows extraordinary attention to each patient and provides tailored and individualized care  He is extremely responsive to e-mails, phone calls, etc Egg freezing is a daunting and arduous process but he made it more than worthwhile, I felt completely supported throughout and I walked away with an even better result than I had expectedCCRM NY, and Dr Levine, in particular, have changed the way I think about my healthcare in general, and I will truly never be the same He was truly my advocate and we were partnered in my care Everything, absolutely everything, was customized to me as an individual human, from the protocols to the way we made decisions about my care He even considered psychological and emotional effects of certain decisions, and not just treatment by the numbers and the probabilities There was no detail that went unnoticed to him, and his nuanced care is truly a gift It's been months and I bet he can remember the minutia and every single detail of my treatment and care",4.333333333333333
106,CCRM Fertility New York,Doctor,Negative," We can never truly thank Dr Levine and CCRM for everything they have done for our familyI could not recommend Dr Knopman and the entire staff at CCRM I never felt rushed or like a number as I did at other clinics My husband and I had been trying to conceive unsuccessfully for 13 months, and I had a terrible experience with an ob gyn who tried to treat me using guesswork out of his office instead of sending me to a specialist I won't go into all the details, but this experience had been totally inhuman, awful, and ineffective I remember crying after my first appointment with Dr Levine, because the experience was so different He didn't rush me, and he repeatedly allowed there to be pauses so I could ask more questions He took what had been a terrible, chaotic, anxiety-inducing experience and turned it into a structured, calm, and unexpectedly FUN experience Months of frustration with the ""factory"" at RMA NY, everything changed when we walked into CCRM and met Dr Brian Levine Within 3 months we were pregnant on our first try! He is not only a wonderful doctor, but he is confident and caring  I had had a horrible previous egg-freezing experience with a different doctor and then came here, and it was night and day different -- and better, with CCRM My husband and I couldn't be more grateful for the compassion, patience and time he has given us   In a way, I blame lack of communication among the team versus an overly salesy attitude, but the net impact still wasn't favorableand here I am, now pregnant from my first IVF cycle! Take it from me who has struggled and wasted time at other clinics I continued at Columbia but this time with a male doctor who I disliked immensely While doing research for another IVF clinic that didn't feel like a cattle call, I happened to find Dr Choi again, but this time she was heading up CCRM in NY When we first came to CCRM, we were frustrated, scared, and confused I actually went to NYU first for a consult- it was a disaster I felt like cattle and was totally ignored by all the support staff there despite the doctor seeming very good there too but all the rest of the staff gave me so much anxiety I can't say enough good things about him and his team--I met many of the other doctors, nurses and techs, and they were all phenomenal It would not surprise me if he was thinking about every single patient outside of his office hours",4.333333333333333
107,CCRM Fertility New York,Doctor,Neutral," Dr Levine is a physician and scientist, and he found the right way to communicate with both my husband and me from the very beginning Dr Levine's approach to our case was personalized and data-driven He cited up to date studies pertaining to the procedures we were involved in and was very thorough and knowledgeable in answering all the questions I had about the whole processTheir attentive and concerned nature made me feel as if I was are their one and only patient Quite literally, just never got in contact with me ever again when I was waiting to hear back about next steps It didn't work that month so on December 18, 2018 Dr Levine called me and left me a voicemail around 4:45pm (apparently to discuss next steps for my next cycle) I called back immediately at 5:10pm that same day but the office was already closed so I followed up with an email to Dr Levine Stephanie called me at noon on the 19th and offered 4:30pm that same day to speak to Dr Levine I had an already-scheduled meeting at that time with my CEO at work so asked if there was any other time that could work or any other day, that I would make myself available but just that specific time wasn't possible for me But it was a whole different story with CCRM staff and Dr Knopman Dr Levine and his team wrote everything down for me, always Dr Levine gave me his direct e-mail, and he ALWAYS responded or called me back, even when I e-mailed late at night  Within days I was meeting Dr Levine (with my mom) for the first time On our very first visit, he knew everything about me and my medical history before I even had to speak! He not only takes the time to get to know his patients personally, but he uniquely designs each treatment plan to meet the individual needs of the patient He made himself available to me via email 24/7 and would respond almost immediatelyI'll begin with her medical expertise: Doctor Choi is the most skilled, knowledgeable physician I have ever met She spent more time with me in the few appointments I had with her than the doctor at Cornell did over the course of 2+ years I was there Between Dr Choi, the staff, the nurses, and the facility - they are all exceptional With fertility treatment, you are always on a roller coaster ride of emotions and CCRM sympathizes with that and gives their patients the necessary education, thought and timeA yelp from my daughter:I don't normally write Yelp reviews, but my experience at CCRM has been so phenomenal I felt compelled to write one Now to the Doctors! I almost always saw Dr Levine which was not the case at Cornell If Dr Levine was busy with a procedure I saw Dr Choi or Dr Talabian who knew me by name and actually remembered me on my next visit Dr Levine was always there to perform my procedures and explain  everything step by step  You feel a part of the CCRM family immediately and the individualized attention they give each of their patients is unparalleled  He was personable from the beginning  Everyone from Dr Levine to the nurses, reception etc were incredible I felt empowered and informed throughout the process",4.333333333333333
108,CCRM Fertility New York,Advice,Positive,"Dr Choi is an absolute gem, and is very clear and direct about treatment options and the state of playIt's pricey, no doubt about it, but if you can swing it you'll be glad you did  Dr Levine's skills, combined with his sense of humor and vast experience make it easy and fun to work with him, which is incredibly important given how stressful fertility journeys can get If you're considering seeing a fertility specialist, do not hesitate to give CCRM-NY (and Dr Levine in particular) a chance From the second you meet her, it's obvious you are about to have science and a true professional on your side Her direction and diagnosis were the keys to unlocking our fertility challenges Tackling infertility is naturally a really emotional and personal experience So if you are looking for an incredible fertility doctor at a highly effective clinic, I recommend a consultation with Dr Choi No matter what you are facing, it's worth a conversation  I felt secure and confident that whatever the outcome or situation they would take of me and that the outcome would be positive More than that, it is clear they care about their patients which is so important during such a challenging timeI write the below review after having the highest of hopes for this practice and utmost faith in the extremely intelligent staff that work there Dr Levine impressed me with his credentials and background He talked a lot about himself (he's a runner, how he wakes up at 4am every day and his morning routine, what he eats to stay healthy) There are so many other important factors when choosing a fertility doctor- like choosing someone with empathyExcellent patient care is CCRM's top priority You hear the same message over and over again, and it's so reassuring and empowering, because you know the plan at all times Dr Levine also has the most fun personality It made this milestone feel all the more special to me and my husband He is truly an amazing, intelligent doctor CCRM is truly the best team there isDr Levine and the staff at CCRM are hands-down the best clinic in New York City  (and I am limiting myself to NYC because I have yet to venture out of the city for any treatments!)The best medical decision I have ever made was switching from RMA to CCRM, and choosing Dr Choi I'm sorry if I missed your name, I tried to keep track of all of you:) I highly recommend CCRM to anyone, even if it's just a thought You must commit to going and getting blood work and ultrasound almost everyday or every other day This is very special in the world of egg freezing You can be sure that they will take good care of you I highly recommend CCRM NYI don't even know where to begin with this review because there aren't enough good things to say about Dr Levine and the entire CCRM-NY team Dr Levine is truly a one-of-a-kind person  Bottom line: just have your wits about you if you go, and remember that you should ask as many questions as you need to get clarity and comfort with next stepsI'm not entirely sure why I'm writing this here, on Yelp: somehow, I feel like this deserves more than the brevity of this site But I want everyone here to know this about Doctor Janet Choi so that others' lives may be changed as mine has beenBut that's the ""easy"" part of what she does: the technical aspect of her profession The process is like a soup made of your bones and heart Doctor Choi is a marvelous doctor and an even more marvelous human beingDoctor Choi: I cannot thank you enough for your insight, care, compassion, and dedication I love you all She is knowledgable, caring and thorough For anyone reading this, don't waste your time at Cornell - check out CCRM first! There will always be someone to take care of you over the phone, email or their online portal, hence you will always be in the loop with your treatments, medication usages/dosages, lab results, billing questions etc! Dr Levine is not only great about calling you but you can reach him via email! I've emailed him the silliest questions and yet he was always quick to reply back without making me feel dumb for asking in the first place What's even more rare is a doctor who is so personable and positive He treats you like a friend and not just another patient he has to deal with Dr Levine has made what could have been a daunting journey, a stress free and pleasant one She was amazing and brilliant Besides being brilliant It has been especially nice to have a doctor that truly cares about her patients Would absolutely recommend CCRM to anyone looking for any help with their fertility journey She is very thorough and determined to help you accomplish whatever you came to her for and will support you along the way I wish all of my doctors in all treatment areas were as good and helpful as Dr Levine Overall, I would highly recommend Dr Levine and the entire CCRM NY team to anyone looking for top notch treatment I am forever grateful for her professionalism, carefulness and for being one of the best doctors that anyone could hope for  He takes the time to recommend treatment that is specific to your case, and not just a textbook protocol  Do not waste your time at other clinics, go straight to CCRM  IVF can be a daunting process , but Dr Levine's group are wonderful at keeping your stress  to a minimum I'm so grateful and highly recommend CCRM to anyone who is looking for a great fertility doctor Thank you CCRM! I wish he could be my doctor for everything under the sun, his team could manage all of my life, and I never have to see another doctor again I would implore him to run workshops all over the world to teach doctors how to provide care like his My biggest piece of advice would be to run, don't walk, to CCRM tomorrow morning (and yes, you can likely get an appointment for tomorrow!!), and don't even think about seeing any other doctor or clinic",4.333333333333333
109,CCRM Fertility New York,Advice,Negative," Couldn't recommend her more highly, and I only wish she were a GP so I could use her as MY doctor She talks fast for sure, but gets right to the point, and isn't afraid to trust her patients with information A lot of doctors will hold back because they think too much of the technical stuff will be confusing or go above your head We might have gone through even more years of disappointment, never knowing why  After several failed IVF attempts at another clinic we traveled across the country based on a recommendation to work with CCRM NYC Ironic this is the case because you would think my experience would be stellar given this fact She replied and in a really condescending way said ""No and if that doesn't work, he will not be able to speak to you until after the holiday""My husband and i couldn't be happier to have met Dr Brian Levine and CCRM Always a quick email away, no matter how silly or insignificant a question Not enough words to thank Dr LevineI cannot recommend this practice and Dr Levine enough CCRM is on the cutting edge and a completely different experience The fertility journey can be hard, but having the right doctor made it manageableFirst and foremost, I cannot more highly recommend CCRM, in particular Dr Levine  As already mentioned by many of the reviewers, I'm not one to write reviews but given how stressful this process can be and how difficult it can be to find firsthand experiences, I feel it's important to offer my experience  Upon receiving my results, I soon was confronted with the reality that I may not have any fertility to preserve  To say I was anxious is an extreme understatement You are NOT a number with him, but rather a human beingTrying to have a child when you're over 40 isn't easy It's brutal: a wild ride of fear, hope, dismay, euphoria, exhaustion, elation, resignation, determination, and outright ambiguityAfter years of struggling with fertility and unsuccessful attempts at several other fertility clinics, I finally decided to travel out of town all the way to New York in order to start fresh at CCRM! As the other reviewers have already stated, there are not enough words to describe Dr Levine and ALL the staff at CCRM As much as I hate western medicine, it made me consider doing another round! If you're looking for any fertility care, CCRM NY is 100% the place to go  Infertility is a scary and nerve-racking process to begin with, and Dr Levine made it incredibly less so  I cannot say enough good things about himI cannot say enough great things about CCRM new York The bar is permanently raised! He is the anti-paternalistic doctor to such an extent that I never could have imagined that a doctor-patient relationship could be this way I obviously cannot say enough good things about CCRM NY, and Dr Levine",4.333333333333333
110,CCRM Fertility New York,Advice,Neutral," Dr Choi is an incredible fertility doctor As I read through these positive reviews, I can only guess that there are few negative reviews because A) The practice is new to NYC and B I receive such personal treatment at my new practice Their approach is extraordinary5 stars is not enough for CCRM-NY I do not have enough words to wax poetic about Dr Levine and the practice  I immediately called and try to get immediate appointments with NYU, Weill Cornellall the usual clinics  In doing my due diligence I of course went to CCRM's website as their work in Denver speaks for itself  If you do ever find yourself facing fertility challenges, I would not hesitate to recommend Dr Levine I knew that no question was too small or insignificant to ask and if need be, he would call me just to make sure I was feeling okay about our course of action  And, you don't have to sign on the dotted line That she is a graduate of Harvard and Columbia (where she also did her one of her two residencies, the other being at Cornell) would surprise no one Not emotionally, not financially, not physically You rarely have to wait past your scheduled appointment time This is the place to go! I could always expect a follow up call from Dr Levine that evening ,even on weekends Unheard of at other practices I cannot say enough about Dr Choi and the staff as whole They know your name, what is going on with you, and are there for absolutely anything you may need",4.333333333333333

114,CCRM Fertility New York,Clinic,Positive,"Kind, patient, and accommodating staff that handles the logistics with precisionPristine well appointed offices Excellent bedside manner: that perfect blend of kindness and humor with a clinical efficiency in communication Dr Knopman and all the staff, from the nurses to the front desk to the behind the scenes embryology team have not only provided me with top notch medical care, but they have done so with compassion I always felt like everyone was rooting for us and doing everything they could for us to be successful The nurses (and I mean all of them, as there are different kinds) were always there with hugs and words of support when I needed it We really felt taken care of and in good hands the whole way throughfrom the front desk the nurses and the every so important Doctors ( the amazing Dr Talebian was my doctor) right down to the billing department this is a team who love what they do and it showsThanks to the whole staff I am pregnant and expecting a baby!I wish I could stay with them though out my 9 months!!!!We feel like it was a true blessing to have started working with CCRM  It was the best decision we could have made CCRM is incredibly efficient and very helpful The staff is amazing (The want to get pregnant sometimes overpowers everything else) I was sold on him, the amazing office and the reputation of CCRM being affiliated with the CO office They have given up on me and did not even have the courtesy  to let me know! I can tell anyone thinking about going to CCRM this: yes, they are highly qualified and intelligent doctors, however, they also have SO many patients and it doesn't always matter where they went to medical school  I have found a new practice (that I so far love by the way)  I had previously tried 2 other clinics and both felt like a factory Their spa-like waiting room with snacks, relaxing music, coffee and tea provided such a comforting feeling during a very stressful time for me Lab work and scans can be scheduled very early in the morning which worked out perfect for me since I had to be at work by 8 am  For me, CCRM defines competency, compassion, professionalism, efficiency & courtesy They were so friendly and wonderful and reassuring, whether drawing blood, demonstrating how best to inject my Ovidrel trigger shot, or calling me to make sure I knew the next steps They were also my cheerleaders and coaches when I didn't get the results I wanted After a previous experience at NYU, ccrm was a breath of fresh air  They are smart, caring, and just amazing people They really began to feel like family Truly taking wonderful care of us!  They took the time to make sure each step was carefully understood,  ALWAYS available by email or call, Even checking on us after our procedure Having been on a roller coaster ride and through multiple practices and doctors I can say with the most conviction this is the BEST place to help you on your path to parenthood The practice also has state of the art technology and you are getting the best care on that front too They are truly the BEST and I would recommend this place to my family and friends if they were on this fertility journey  They are real true blessings!First off, I would like to say that I am a lover of yelp but admittedly don't write enough reviews, compared to how much I use it I figured I would check them out and then a few other known hospitals to see where I felt the most comfortableThe staff is AMAZING!!!! From the front desk, to the nurses, to the business office and of course the Doctors! Everyone, and I mean everyone was sooo professional, kind, patient, helpful and positive The atmosphere is very tranquil and makes you feel at home The process was made so easy, and I completed the cycle last week I have eggs in the freezer:) I always felt cared for, and they were flexible with my schedule This is what makes them special; they cater the hormones based on your levels so if you're getting too much based on how your labs come back- they will either lower or increase your dose The nurses basically run the show and they are so sweet and welcoming! I posted an entire story on my instagram throughout the course of the process if you want to check it out! @jenniferwinkelried Working with them was an all around wonderful experience  To my amazement they had just opened an office in NYC  While they cannot guarantee I will have a child they made me feel immediately that even though I was ""only"" going through egg freezing, I was AS important as every other woman there and my care and comfort was of the utmost importance  I thank them from the bottom of my heart I knew from the minute that I walked through the doors that my husband and I were in the best hands possible We were treated with love and warmth at every single visit, making it even harder to leave when our treatment was upI had really high hopes for this clinic, having read so many enthusiastic reviews and gotten references from friends  The only bright spot was one of the nurses - she was kind and empathetic, probably the only person who recognized that this was a voluntary visitFrom the bottom of my heart, I thank you Everyone from the front desk receptionists, admin in the back office, phlebotomists, nurses, billing admin and doctors are the most caring, friendly, knowledgeable professionals you'll ever meet They treat you as if you are their only patient! Everyone at CCRM knows you by name and appointments are a breeze to schedule I was especially thankful, going into this long distance The nurses emailed me all the necessary documents, sent prescriptions to my pharmacy out of town and just made the whole process as easy as possible! Speaking from my experiences at other clinics, all of the mentioned above is RARE The quality of care at CCRM is top notch!! There is no need to go searching elsewhere I had heard that CCRM in Colorado was the best fertility clinic in the country and I was pleased to see that it was now in NYC as well It is a beautiful facility -- clean, welcoming, friendly front desk staff and calm, especially during a time that can be highly emotional and stressfulI would highly, highly recommend this place to anyone considering IVF/ egg freezing, fertility options, etc! The doctors and nurses here are beyond AMAZING, personable, intelligent and kind I have seen three of the doctors here and they are all fantastic with great bedside manner From the lovely receptionists who greet you by name, to the amazing nurses who are always available to you, the staff at CCRM could not be more accommodating They were familiar with my situation and just wonderful I have never met a lovelier, more knowledgeable, more positive doctor  There is not enough room here for me to sing CCRM's praises!!! I am due in September with my second daughter!! Beyond the incredible staff and care, the space itself is brand new and beautiful -- feels like a spa, which helps add a calmness to the whole situationMy husband and I had the absolute BEST possible experience at CCRM I cannot recommend CCRM enough, their personalized approach not only makes an uncomfortable process more enjoyable, but also provides amazing results The entire team from receptionists to nurses to the team of doctors and business support were highly attentive & personalCCRM NY is amazing! Everyone from the front desk staff to all of the doctors far exceeded my expectations The facility itself is state of the art and super clean It is a beautiful modern and clean space too At CCRM it is a different and far better world, they humanize and personalize every moment  They ALL remember your name and are extremely efficient with bloodwork  Even the receptionist is welcoming I had spent too much time  with another practice that felt like a factory with a great deal of frustration before I found CCRM  Aside from their impressive credentials and top notch lab, their empathy and genuine care was amazingI had an incredibly positive experience hereThese group of physicians have the best success ratio, professional, personalized and compassionate in making our dreams come truethank you CCRM you are all so awesome!

Women are too nervous to post something negative in fear they could be jinxed or something It's shocking and disgusting It's disgusting and so upsetting- especially after everything that I have been through with the struggle of infertility and the financial implications that come along with it I know this seems so simple, but I can't tell you how reassuring it was to have a plan and to have that plan documented in writingIf you are looking for a place to do IVF, THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO!!!!!!

116,CCRM Fertility New York,Clinic,Neutral," Even when another doctor (Dr Levine) was filling in to keep us on schedule, it was obvious they were in communication with each other and checking in behind the scenes Today is February 5th (over a month later) and I have yet to hear back from anyone at CCRM In my experience, CCRM's main concern is money, not their patients Everyone knew my name the second I entered their office All the nurses knew me and were kept informed as to where I was in the process Needless to say, I walked into CCRM in August and didn't check out any other hospital after that visit I got 24 and I was monitored the entire process  To summarize my situation, as a 36 year woman, I had seen an advertisement from a clinic (with reputable doctors) who catered primarily to women looking to preserve their fertility versus going through the full IVF process  The first step was to get some bloodwork done Sometimes, it all works out; sometimes, it doesn't You are in and out of there! Communication is a breeze with them It's the same thing with the nurses Being a patient at CCRM was a whole new game Each person at CCRM - from the doctors to the nurses to the technicians to the staff - is absolutely incredibleI first used another fertility clinic in NYC, but when I heard that CCRM was opening an office here, I switched immediately This place stands out above all the others that I researched",4.333333333333333
117,CCRM Fertility New York,Protocol,Positive," Because it was our first time seeing a RE, he started with a very thorough diagnosis procedure and recommended that we attempt IUI first, explaining to us the success rate of this procedure compared to the slightly more invasive IVF procedure After a few IUI attempts that were not working for us, he recommended that we move on to IVF, which we did, ultimately achieving success on our first embryo transferDr Levine performed my egg retrieval procedure, which was flawless As I developed thyroid issues early in my pregnancy he recommended a great list of endocrinologists that I could choose from, based on my health insurance coverage and preference He also recommended a long list of great OBGYNs at graduation and made sure I checked out to an OBGYN he trusted upon graduation (Take a pad and pen with you for notes!)I appreciated her thorough approach especially when it led to a discovery of a small growth in my pituitary  CCRM gave us hope that we had all but lost I don't blame CCRM for this outcome and I don't and didn't expect CCRM to work miracles They clearly know that I am no longer a viable IVF patient (their money-maker) I could provide other examples of why I believe this is true but it's not the point of my reviewMost importantly I got pregnant with the first IVF Cycle I left my first appointment with a clear plan: we would start as non-invasively as possible, with a timed intercourse cycle (including Letrazole and an Ovidrel trigger shot, to maximize our chances) Our first IUI was successful, and I am now 4 months pregnant with a baby girl!I was obviously thrilled with the outcome We were successful in our first ivf cycle at ccrm and are now 18 weeks pregnant Freezing my eggs and choosing CCRM is one of the best decisions I have ever made! Since I had so many eggs, my recovery was a bit more intense than if someone had only a few We now are 14 weeks pregnant, with additional healthy tested embryos preserved  While I had not yet made any decisions and was clear that I would not do so that day or be rushed into a commitment, most of the staff who met with me still assumed I was all in and tried to get treatments started and tests run, including ones I didn't understand the rationale behind I first met Dr Choi at Columbia a couple years ago when I had my eggs frozen I decided to stop moving forward with the process until I found a doctor and a place that I liked I can not stress this enough She couldn't be at my egg retrieval but called the night before to check in and then again on the day of retrieval to make sure I was feeling ok Our experience with them includes both an IVF freezing cycle as well as an ovulation induction and IUI cycle After having gone to a different clinic with two failed retrievals, I was successful with Dr Levine on my first retrieval and first transfer I froze eggs in nov and going back to do another round next month What started off as consultation regarding ovulation ended up in a 9 month journey and a successful IVF transfer Dr Levine went above and beyond to make sure everything went as smoothly as possible",4.333333333333333

I don't know where to begin They don't mess up bills, forget to prescribe drugs I need (like CCRM did for me twice) and my new doctor cares about me- not just taking my money  The very last meeting was to walk through cost, so, I would have opted into all manner of procedures and drugs and only known the impact to my financial situation after I'd mentally committed I drained any coverage I had with Cornell and when I realized I was going to be paying for this out of my own pocket, I went looking for the best and CCRM is definitely that!!

I have a beautiful 2 year old son and am currently 6 months pregnant! Dr T and the staff at Sher are kind, patient, accommodating and at this point I consider them an extension of my family Some times I've had to reschedule meetings and another time Dr Dicken accommodated me despite the ridiculous appointment given for 8am Yet despite the high patient volume, I still felt more professionalism, kindness, and 'general ease' as a patient, then I ever felt at SIRMI was Dr Wang pt- him and his team were excellent We never got the hold of the anesthesiologist and never got 400$ back nor SHER helped us through it Anyhow I got a beautiful baby boy from Dr Wang and I am forever grateful to him and his team Dr Dicken is warm, caring, and super smart -- she's been willing to work with us through several failed IUIs, and now a successful IVF cycle Highly recommended! After meeting with me he did an immune workup and found that I have elevated NK activity You have 24/7 access to Dr T and trust me, he is the most patient human being out there! He will nonstop respond to all of my emails no matter what time of the day I send them He is so prompt with responses to email, and for a nervous person like me this is ideal T, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for being such a compassionate and caring doctor, for being such a smart and caring doctor, and most importantly, for being the miracle worker that you are!UPDATE #1: I now have a beautiful 4 month old baby thanks to Dr T! And I'll be going back to him next week to work towards baby #2!Update #2: thanks to DrT I am 6 months pregnant with baby#2 I've never had an issue with them forgetting to call me and inform me about any changes to my protocol I'm really surprised by the one-star reviews on here and had the complete opposite experience, so I wanted to express how highly I recommend Dr Dicken and the team at Sher  Fertility struggles are always difficult, and you may not get the results you hope for, but the team at Sher made the whole experience as pleasant as possible for me, and I successfully conceived my baby girl via IVF with Dr Dicken My experience was excellent and successful, and my beautiful healthy baby girl is a testament to that Dr Dicken is quite knowledgeable and has this girl next door appeal that completely puts one at easeI'm cuddling with my baby thanks to the efforts of the staff at Sher- especially Dr Wang and Raifa Zody, the embryologist  I saw a doctor at LIJ first, and would leave in tears after how he treated us They made me feel comfortable and was very positive with the process I was about to start Dr T is an absolutely perfect, kind and humble person Dr Dicken, a staff doctor, seemed nice, but was also clueless for a ""specialist"" Her suggested, cookie-cutter protocol wouldn't have worked for us Different protocol and medications worked, and also, Dr Tortoriello was very kind and cared about his patients very much  Dr Tortoriello was successful with me on a first try  I was told the truth by Dr T from the beginning Dr O'Shaughnessy was thorough, patient and kind throughout the entire process We brought home our son the other day and he's healthy and perfectI loved working with Dr Dicken She was patient, kind, and always available to answer all of my questions My daughter was born a couple of weeks ago and I'm so grateful to have found Dr Dicken Fertility treatment can be stressful but I always felt like I was in good hands with Sher and I recommend them to anyone in a similar situation  No one listened to me, looked me in the eyes or cared  She is caring, down to earth and smartIt is my honor to write this review on Dr Tortoriello (Dr T), who treated me with great knowledge and professional care We are joyful in my pregnancy the birth of our daughter this October and we are really glad to be treated by Dr T The meeting with the primary doctor was usually very cold and brief and I could feel that she was exhausted and was ready to dismiss me as fast as possible He is compassionate and objective at the same time I was very happy to find out that she communicates via email which is something that in this day and age all doctors should be doing She explained things thoroughly and always assured that I was comfortable with each step Thanks to Dr O and the whole team at Sher we are expecting our first child, and I truly believe that this would not have happened if we stayed at the other clinicLet me start off by saying I love my doctor, Dr Althea O'Shaughnessy she has been great through the process already and that is why I am giving a 4 star rating If you can't give me a time and you know your first available appointment is at 8 am why ask me for a specific time?!??! Like I said I keep going back for my doctor and my nurse, Annie Chan, but the rest of the staff be warned  IVF is a tough process to go through, and I was hoping for a more pleasant, cared for, connected experience  Bushra, the nurse, who showed me how to use the injections buzzed through the instructions like she had to be elsewhere, I felt so rushed and felt like such a number not a human  No one was there to see me out, to give me some instructions, I left feeling very confused and hoped that someone would contact me later She is warm and professional and her expertise helped us conceive our little miracle The doctor's office is run like a well-oiled machine, but with good bedside manner I am grateful to have her help me through this journey and I would highly recommend her for IVF and fertility issuesI truly cannot thank Dr Dicken and the staff of SIRM enough for their hard work and support After 5 years of fertility treatments, my husband and I welcomed our daughter into the world on 2/7/18 Although it did take some time for us to find the protocols and treatments that ultimately worked (I have a fairly complicated medical history), I was continually amazed by the dedication Dr Dicken exhibited toward my case She was there at every turn -- from recommending different tests and treatment options along the way to returning panicked emails promptly to lending a compassionate ear when I needed it most Highly, highly recommend I literally just cleared my tubes two weeks ago and I found out I was pregnant today!!!! She is an awesome person! I'm soooooo glad I sought her help! She's not just about money, she REALLY CARED!!! She's the best Dr I've EVER had  :) Dr Dicken was on maternity leave for the first IUI, so Dr T performed the 1st one and Dr Wang did my second IUI, both were great!!!! Dr Dicken is amazing, as are Dr T & Dr Wang! Dr Dicken sat with us for over an hour in the initial consultation and revamped my medication regiment to focus on egg quality rather than quantity Not only is he intelligent, but also kind, extremely calm (which is something I needed!), and honest (he tells you how it is, so don't expect sugar coating)Dr Wang is the BEST--he's gotten me successfully pregnant twice I was given Sher Institutes name from a friend and calling them was the best decision ever  Dr Dicken was the most caring, empathetic and approachable doctor I've seen She provided so much calmness to me and I couldn't have done it without her Unlike our previous experience  in which we felt we were being treated like cattle, over at the Sher institute we felt like everyone there knew our situation and were there to help us make it happen  However, when I approached Dr T to explain this (a problem with signaling from my pituitary that only started when I was 20 yrs old), he had a plan in mind for my treatment and it worked! Throughout the process Dr T was so calm, positive and reassuring He took my preferences into account and was always flexible with appointments regarding my work schedule I had the sinking sense that he was just trying to get rid of me because I had a complicated fertility profile and he didn't want to mess up his excellent success rates When I went to see Dr Tortoriello I immediately felt that I could trust him He is one of the most balanced, caring and intelligent doctors I have ever had You really feel like he is plugged into your case You know that feeling, when you are sitting across from a doctor and he is giving you these canned answers, like he is reading from a script or has said this to so many people that he is bored of hearing it himself? Dr T is the exact opposite of that",4.6
127,Sher Institute For Reproductive Medicine,Doctor,Negative,"I should have written this review a while ago when I had my first experience with the rude receptionist (I think she practices being her rudest everyday), and ridiculous scheduling system Regarding the consistently rude receptionist, the one with the glasses who sits on the side closest to the elevator - she never smiles, is unkind, demonstrates a consistent inability to help or accommodate and is consistently MATTER-of-FACTThe two stars are what is left of my terrible experience with this clinic, if not for the responsive and attentive care that I receive from Dr Dicken and Jacqueline Piccardo I would give 0 stars (if possible) And for all the ladies that reached out to me with similar traumatic experiences at SIRM, I'm sorry I didn't respond to you in a timely manner Thank to them i am 10 weeks pregnant and I am just waiting to have this fetus dies into my body as it had genetic default!!!!! Can you imagine the traumaCan't say enough good things about Dr Dicken and the staff at Sher I was so scared about never being able to get pregnant again and Dr T made it happen for me on his first cycle Since my doctor was fired and the office was closed about a week before my scheduled transfer,  I had to seek another doctor This Institue took a year of my life and all I received in return was an ""I'm sorry"" Dr Dicken got the job done on our second IVF, both times we paid out-of-pocket for everything Dr Wang is personable, explains everything fully, and even emails! I was never just a number After I was devastated the second time it did not work, I emailed Dr Dicken, she responded with one line and repeated that I need to have surgery to remove my fibroids  Not only is the staff remarkable, but from an operational aspect, Sher also kick-a** My case was not easy for her, and she tried her best to adjust my protocol but that is all she could do No one ever came back and I had to climb down  I had to email the doctor and he said, no one talked to you after?  No She made a very stressful process with high emotions something that was optimistic and manageable Sher is not a factory like the other clinics (ie Cornell, RMA) He doesn't make huge promises (read: sales pitches) but he is more focused on his patients and designing custom protocols for them than any of the other seven doctors I have seen at those five top facilities",4.6
128,Sher Institute For Reproductive Medicine,Doctor,Neutral,"  I saw Dr Dicken at every appointment and she always took the time to answer my questions and discuss next steps I saw Dr Tortoriello, He listened to me and gave me options that I could choose from based​ on my situation Dr T was quick to reply my emails even on Sunday My first experience at Sher was completely different I saw the same doctor at almost every visit (unless it was a weekend or she was on vacation) Dr O'Shaughnessy even came in on her weekend off to do my egg retrieval Sher Institute gives me nightmares  Sher and Dr Dicken and her staff are *complete* opposites Even trying to get my medical records was gigantic ordeal  I have never, not once, ever received a call telling me my appointment time  Appointments felt rushed, Dr Tortoriello who was my doctor didn't ask if I had any questions-ever-, and didn't really connect on a human level a whole lot I saw Dr T for each and every appt (except when I had to go in on one Sunday and he wasn't on call that weekend) He answers emails",4.6
129,Sher Institute For Reproductive Medicine,Advice,Positive," I was out of hope and trust in SIRM and desperate for results I wish you ladies all the best and pray for you all to be successful in your journeyplease reach out and pm me if you have any specific questions or want to talk Best wishes to all You are a number with a $ value no more He is always very receptive and caring He listens and most importantly this is like a boutique clinic where it is all about you Dr T will be the only doctor on top of your treatment, making up your treatment schedule, doing all of your monitoring and all of your procedures They are very good at keeping track with your protocol and followups When you create your treatment plan, you sit down with person who does billing You can basically choose what you want and/or need to do You also have a clear understanding how much you're paying and for what  I think your experience with any of these clinics likely depends on how you like to work with your medical team- I'm always needing to be in control and need someone who will answer my calls and emails on time, and that's what I got at Sher that I didn't get elsewhere  Five stars for the team at Sher- I'm already excited to get back in the office to meet with Dr Dicken and plan for my next baby! I like Dr Dicken and the patient coordinator, Jacqueline Be wary of billing and never provide your credit card information lest you desire to pay for things that you did not authorize Patient care receives four starsI have thought long and hard about writing this review, but I feel like other people who are about to start the ivf journey should absolutely be aware of the issues I experienced I wasn't there for any pregnancy issues, and I made myself clear to the doctor why I am there Be careful With his great work, I had a successful IVF procedure I am super excited, and I am recommending Sher Institute to anyone struggling to have a babyI love Dr T He is simply the best I hope that they replace her with someone nice  He gives the raw facts whether you want to hear it or not  I feel he was competent and I never had to worryHe knows what he's doing I would never go to another doctor If you are looking for a fertility clinic I strongly recommend you interview them At Cornell, my doctor called me on a Sunday afternoon before my transfer (while walking his own kid to a birthday party) This is to say just to say how much he cared I am forever grateful to him  Dr Dicken will sit with you for however long you want to listen to your concerns and questions  She is just a really good person  Plus, one of the best parts is that you can email her your questions and she replies promptly)If you are starting your fertility journey, please start with Sher  This is an emotionally taxing enough endeavor- do yourself a favor and start with a clinic that cares about you But we finally made up minds to search for another doctor and take the last IVF chance He is the person I can trust He won't give up if you don't but he also gives you alterative options and make sure that you are comfortable with your choices I believe his biggest goal is to make women fulfill their dreams of becoming a mother My husband and I had a wonderful experience with everyone there and highly recommend this practiceDr O is a kind and warm person with an appropriate level of firmness and humor in her approach Every piece of advice from the Sher team was perfect, especially their urologist recommendation, Dr David Kaufman Please don't waste your time and money with SHER Also make sure you get a copy of EVERYTHING you sign  Sher likes to email forms instead of handing them to you in the officeWe have nothing bad to say about the doctor, only everything and everyone around her We wish you better luck  But this is worth writingDr O is simply the bestDrDicken is my favorite doctor at SIRM NYC  She has a great bedside manner and does not try to apply cookie cutter protocols I recommend you to run away from this place   Make sure you read the financial plans line by line We HIGHLY recommend Sher above all else!!! Thank you SHER!!!!!!! There are so many options but please trust me and make an appt with Dr T  He actually cares and will thoroughly go over your history and make sure he treats you appropriately You will be in good hands! He's amazingAfter seeing other IVF specialists in the city and being told I would likely not have children with my own eggs, I decided to do some more research about who else could help me I am eternally grateful to him not just for getting me pregnant but for creating an atmosphere in which I could relax and trust which I believe helped me be successful",4.6
130,Sher Institute For Reproductive Medicine,Advice,Negative," I would not recommend this place to anyoneHorrible experience Are you serious???!!! I didn't even ask for my scheduled time I just suggested I was there to see Dr DickenI am not sure if I trust this place as they have a ridiculous appointment policy  I don't think I can recommend this place to any of my friends that are looking to find out some information on fertility options to be left feeling cheated  This is very disheartening It is such a pity to know he is no longer thereDespite of all these, we had to confirm and reconfirm the payments over and over: every couple of weeks would get an email saying "" you can not start your treatment unless you pay your balance""! Hence making calls and someone didn't know about the payment and then again and again! I think in a course if two months we confirmed the payments three times I am not sure how a lump sum of 4k can get misplaced in the system with no record, but apparently at SHER it doesDon't do that to yourself, please I am traumatized by this practice I think they don't want you to be pregnant as they will make more money if you aren't I cannot say enough good things about Dr T I find this  Institute to be unethical at its core Mistakes on med calendars, overlooking pertinent details, last minute delays in protocol were all common practice in my experience After all this is why I'm paying them And I know that the process to the end result can be stressful and painful So be warned, if you can avoid it, pay by check instead I think it is awful to dismiss other reviews for this reason As a patient we go through an awful lot to get a viable eggI hate doctors do whatever tests or extra stuffs without asking the patients to make some extra money I am not only very mad about this rip-off situation, but also worried about the time that I will waste to make this thing correct Completely clueless  She does not sugarcoat anything and is straight with you He is not a magic maker but he is the best possible doctor you could work with as a man I would give it negative stars if I could It's taken me years to write this review because it was such a horrendous experience HOWEVER, I have to agree with the other reviewers about the office staff and the rudeness and lack of follow up  Seriously, if you havent heard anything from Sher about your upcoming appointment time by 4:45 - pick up your phone AND CALL!As you may imagine we were unsuccessful in our attempts to get pregnantI just want to say, I am not the kind of person who writes negative reviews  I am exceptionally disappointed that I chose SHER and I will let everyone I know about my experience I was, too, very unsure and confused I can't explain how comforting it is to know you are seeing the same dr during such an emotional process You will not feel like 'just another patient' We couldn't be happier with Dr T and his staff, and can't wait to see our little baby boy in a few more months",4.6
131,Sher Institute For Reproductive Medicine,Advice,Neutral," Just don't do that to yourself He never pushes anything and always thinks outside of the box He never orders unnecessary tests and always reviews all of your records thoroughly before your initial consultStay far far away They will misrepresent them so you will continue with the pricey treatments My one piece of advice to potential patients is keep researching25 stars if that were possible And that's what Dr O'Shaughnessy doingAfter 5 long years trying to get pregnant I realize that medical opinions may vary among experts, but insisting so much that someone goes through surgery without backing up your claim is something else I advise you to stay away  You have an individual room to recover!  (At my other clinic you recovered right next to the other women who had surgery, with the only divider being a sheet And with that goal, he stands out from his peersRun don't walk away from this place Be mindful of billing I will never go back to this office again But I DO have two pieces of advice1 - Ask questions  Ask more questions  When you see these forms in your email, you might have questions, or the forms might be incomplete  Go ahead and email your questions back  YOU HAVE TO CALL She thinks outside the box and will go the extra mileDr Tortoriello does not really try to find a cause why you are infertile  After you make the appointment, you need to wait for the front desk to call you for appointment confirmation until the day before Imagine you have daily appointments at the end of the cycle With her adviceexactly what you are looking for in a Doctor You will have his attention for as long as you need; he never rushed me out After six years of dealing with, seemingly intractable, infertility and going to five of the most reputable clinics on both the east coast and west coasts, I am now 12 weeks pregnant He remembers your info when you have an appt with him He is a real person Some women gush about him",4.6
132,Sher Institute For Reproductive Medicine,Nurse,Positive," The simple response would have been okay, but instead she had to let me know that I'm the schedule for 8:30 She's very responsive on email and answers all of my questions, big and small, quickly and thoroughly Dr Dicken was always responsive to emails within hours, even on the weekends This was very helpful for usThe staff are great It was as if I sent her nothing - absolutely no response Having now experienced a clinic where the co-ordinators support the nurses, it is a far more effective system and creates a much more supportive culture Rest of the staff was wonderful specially the nurse Jackie PThe staff at Sher is informative and supportive Jessica, the office manager, took a good hour to go through the financial options My experience here was fantasticSher was the total opposite, from Yochana at the front desk to the office manager Jessica; but most importantly Dr O'Shaughnessy and her team All of the nurses and clinical staff were great too, especially Voula who went absolutely above and beyond when we ran into a hiccup in our cycle The office staff were also incredibly helpful and caring New Hope was a winner for me giving me my precious baby girl from the first try The nurses and office staff here are also top notch He is also very responsive via email (replied within couple of hours), which was super helpful for a nervous wreck like me She empowered me to help make decisions while providing excellent guidance and expertise",4.6
133,Sher Institute For Reproductive Medicine,Nurse,Negative," Each time I have these encounters I say to myself how much I ""hate this place"" and then I'm reminded of the care I receive from Dr Dicken and her patient coordinator Jacqueline Piccardo I get to the front desk, the rude receptionist goes on to tell me with the snide look on her face that she doesn't have me on the schedule for 8, she has me on there for 8:30 Jackie and the nursing team have been fantastic, even responding to a panicked email late at night when I was having trouble with a trigger shot And when I contacted the office manager Jessica about it she ignored my emails Unclear and erroneous information (often errors in medication and instructions, no clarity about billing; 23 page invoice and unable/unwilling to answer questions about it)",4.6
134,Sher Institute For Reproductive Medicine,Nurse,Neutral, She has detailed description of procedures and their prices printed out for you  I always had personalized attention at Sher from Dr Dicken and nurses Marian and Jackie and they always responded to me timely For something I never asked for She answered emails quickly (and I sent lots) I emailed her back with a couple questions and she never replied back I then called to talk to her and she never called me back And all those online reviews are telling the consistent story,4.6
135,Sher Institute For Reproductive Medicine,Clinic,Positive," Their contact is rude, and short fused and hasn't called me back for months- until today!If you are looking for a fertility clinic please look no further- they made this process as beautiful as can be Do yourself a favor and go to a clinic that has better lab quality and will work harder for you You would think the front desk staff would be a the softest, kindest spot in the clinic For any of the reviews that say Cornell is like a factory, so many women go there because the care is world class  First thing they asked when I called to schedule an appointment was my credit card information - $50 copay and $150 for cancelation fee  I can't really comment on the doctors here but don't think I can trust a place that's so money focused and only in it for profit We haven't been anywhere else and I wouldn't want to -- the level of professionalism, service, and friendliness is just right I can look overlook that, though, with the quality of care and service I've received The process was perfect and went so smoothly, we couldn't ask for a better outcome My spouse and I Love you from the bottom of our hearts for helping us create the family we once thought we would never have There has got to be better out thereIt's hard to give reviews to a place like that Meanwhile, the girl who seem to be like 18 years old in the billing department couldn't tell me what the percentage was or how much money I would get back With That said, I didn't have to be on top of things all the time, because I was pretty sure that they do it for me They also made it very easy with prescriptions, I was looking for the cheapest places to find my drugs, and they would forward and re forward prescriptions for me to different pharmacies pretty quickly The nurses are also pretty cool, I've never had anyone being rude or unprofessional But honestly, I pretty much had a stress free experience  Appointments were easy to schedule in the morning before work, and the team of receptionists and nurses all knew me personally and made everything super easy   This was a huge contrast to the other IVF clinics in NYC, where the receptionists were disorganized and didn't answer the phone half the time I would call The first, but perhaps not the biggest, problem is that clinic is extremely disorganized They admitted to me that the operator was less experienced and that they were understaffed because of Thanksgiving I understand that Thanksgiving is a holiday, but in most cases the Dr is in charge of managing your cycle, so they could prevent this via closer management or better staffing The older you get the less good eggs you have Like they think patients don't know anything Wish me good luckThe two stars are because I have a beautiful daughter that wouldn't have been possible without the help of IVF Then was told well actually I'm going to be out of town on your transfer day Their scheduling system was a joke I was overcharged and when I pointed out that they had over charged me their response was ""oh did you not want us to charge that?"" Yes of course please take more money after the thousands of dollars we are already giving you They completely take advantage of the vulnerability in people who just want to be parents I've never had doctors fight so hard for me before It was amazing to be able to discuss questions and concerns with my actual doctor outside of appointmentsIf you look at Vitals or one of the websites that's known for rating doctors, rather than restaurants, you'll see that Sher has phenomenal reviews, which they've very much earnedEvery staff I met at Sher from the first visit was very welcoming, friendly and made me feel comfortable Not only would it not have worked, but they aborted a procedure MID-TREATMENT (yes, during the procedure itself), because an independently contractor doctor was impatient, running late, and in a hurry Thank you so much!!I came to Sher after a frustrating experience at another ""monster"" clinic, the kind that makes you feel like a number and not a patient She is a compassionate provider and up on the latest techniques The front desk staff were responsive and the nursing staff were consistently kind and personable They were pretty sloppy The staff at Sher always made me feel at home which is helpful when it feels like you live there! They always had appointments first thing in the morning and I was often in and out within 15 minutes  They treated me and all the other patients as farm animals They care, smile at you and know you by name!  I cannot put into words how amazing it feels to be at a place where everyone is genuinely nice and cares about you I have never had a scheduling issue and the staff in charge of insurance matters is extremely informative, competent and easy to work withLastly, their surgery center is really nice We had really hard time attending the other factory-like clinic--dealing with multiple doctors, waiting in long lines and facing with a big stack of bills So I arrived for 8 am just in case I had an early appt like requested Thank goodness I did, my appt was for 8:30 am When I called to make my next appointment, the receptionist asked me when I would like to come in I said first available please, ""Ma'am what time do you want to come in?"" The tone was so rude, I replied ""8 am or 8:30?"" Again she didn't give me a time just told me they would call and confirm the time After a procedure I was told they would be back in 10 minutes to help me down from the table People in the office have been really helpful  For those who don't know, SHER doesnt have 'cattle calls' like many other clinics doWe are not medical experts, but the constant stream  of small errors gave us little confidence in the process or the personnel  I did not feel like I was well taken care of  This was absolutely a horrible way to treat a patient who paid good money for this procedure and now who is walking out the door having had the transfer only to feel like they were 'done' with me Office hours are the most flexible I've ever seen, I never had to wait more than a minute upon arrival to be seen, often I'd even arrive early and would be out before my scheduled appointment time I went to Cornell thinking they are the best, but we were again not blessed with the babyThis facility is not closed, however, I had the WORST experience with it just like the first reviewer You need to chase down the phone line to get a simple straight answer  The doctors and nurses are all so warm & make you feel so comfortable The doctors answer your emails even on the weekends and in the evenings!!  The front staff are great too Dr Azim was great BUT the lab that he uses (Gramercy IVF) has freezers that ruined our sperm quality which was excellent quality from a sperm bank I can't say I was a very complicated case, but even so, my husband and I were always treated as if we were the only patients there All the receptionists and nurses came to know us by name and were genuinely always happy to help Also, the new offices are beautiful! If you are unsure of which clinic in NYC to choose, this next part is for you But I've later realized it's because they actually go by appts and honor the appts; you will not be 1 of 10 patients scheduled at 2pmI only have positive things to say  I would recommend this group to anyone who has been told what I was, or if you are just starting off on your IVF journey Definitely, the best fertility clinic out there This is the most responsive and caring group of medical professionals I have EVER experienced When you get off the elevator the receptionists greet you by your first name (the opposite of making you feel like a number, which I felt so many times at other facilities) I have only ever heard them say good things about this facility and Dr TThis office is not closed but is absolutely TERRIBLE in their communication Medically they are OK but they are rude, unhelpful, and treat you like just another #",4.6
136,Sher Institute For Reproductive Medicine,Clinic,Negative,"I had a very disturbing experience with one of their doctor and nurse teams They take their time, actually listen and answer every question ( very late emails as well!) I can't recommend them enough- and I do to anyone going through this process! I could go on and on!!!! The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the dreadful billing department out of Las VegasThe last straw is this specimen that I was told I could bring in at 8am and this same rude, unsympathetic reception insists that no one is available until after 8:30 Right now I FUCKING HATE THIS PLACE, as I sit in the reception area crying with a specimen that I'm certain may no longer be viableTrying to conceive when having challenges is already stressful and depressing and the additional challenges I experience with front desk staff and scheduling just makes this entire experience overwhelmingly sad  I called a few hours later to cancel my appointment and was told that they will be charging me $50  I have never heard of anything like this But this review is only about SHER: the billing was a disaster- when you are going through infertility, everything feels harder so you expect at least the fertility center makes it easier for you First they quoted us the wrong amount, we paid everything then in a couple of weeks they corrected their mistakes and we paid the balance  I am sorry for the other patients who suffered as a result of their poor management After our first attempt failed I went to Cornell, NYU and RMA for second opinions and also to find out how they proceed with  their protocols and maybe they would come up with new way of treatments for me  Sher differentiates itself because you really do get personal treatment and you do not feel like just a number, as tends to happen with the other large IVF clinics When you find out that they have ordered the wrong medication (occasionally at great expense) on the day that you are supposed to be starting treatment, the stress that is added to the entire experience is exponential, because then it is up to you to run around town to find a specialty pharmacy that has the meds in stock, some of which are further constrained by national shortages Every time something went wrong, which was pretty much weekly, no one took responsibility, never mind that no one apologized and the next time I went in everyone looked more and more terrified and harried, but because taking responsibility was for some reason impossible, it meant that no one would offer to help fix the problem It was very obvious that the staff below the Dr level were not getting the support they needed The receptionists are rude and never pick up the phone The staff is rude and unhelpful The thing that gets me most upset is the lack organization with their billing They didn't even care to check or notice Lady on the front desk is rudeRUN like your pants are on fire!!! Stunningly unprofessional After several failed attempts at another clinic, I found out I had immune issues Then, they sent me outrageous bills for he procedure that never happened! You can't make this stuff up I am also really unhappy with their manners  Every time I had to have surgery I cried on the table- not because I was scared, it was because everyone was so callous and coldI came to SIRM after a frustrating experience at another clinic I had previously been to another clinic where I felt like part of a herd being shuffled in and out with no personalized care  The doctor and nurses gave me such bad and insufficient information and wouldn't take any responsibility for it It was a mess  They are the worstBy far the worst experience I have had with a doctor's office The Manhattan location is the rudest by far When I showed up at the Manhattan location they tried to get me to resign the form that had the fraudulent signature When I refused, they said you've already signed it and showed me the signature that someone else had put on an insurance form  I even totally missed an appointment this way because I waited, and no one called Miscommunication with the lab caused a months' delay and the office staff was untruthful about this until pressed Scheduling with wrong doctors, wrong medications indicated on treatment schedule, incorrect information on dosing caused lost time at work to find alternative sources  There was no followup from the doctor, not one word  The nurse who called me to give me the bad news said he would follow up, and probably take another blood test etc Some of the staff are really rude Among the worst is its office manager ironically And BTW, it is not surprising that they don't call you back as promised However, I didn't expect to have to deal with so many incompetent staff which could jeopardize the result of an entire cycle We had such a bad experience at RMA I was actually nervous while in the waiting room before my first appt because there weren't hundreds of women waiting Not only did they help me get pregnant, but they made the difficult process so much easier Throughout the procedure all the staff was very helpful and responsive to our schedule and concerns and we can't be more grateful for their great service The previous poster is in California so perhaps she is confusing this facility with another one",4.6
137,Sher Institute For Reproductive Medicine,Clinic,Neutral," They were very professional and because of them, we finally have our baby girl!Just keep every record of payment and take a deep breath before you call their billing department in Las Vegas Also I received a test that was out of network without being told and was billed $4,412! They have one method of doing IVF and even though I requested a new method I was never given one The doctors also go on their own vacations for weeks at a time which can really interfere with your treatment Regarding scheduling, I've had several scheduling incidents where they call me at the end of the day to provide an appointment time for the next day despite the preferred times offered I can't understand how a fertility clinic can be so inefficient I hardly ever check YELP  They took my $50 deposit for just making a call to schedule an appointment Everything  The office itself is so mismanaged Very shady practice Fortunately my credit card company found the charges suspicious and contacted me right away The problem here is that the nurse practitioners are made to double up as administrative co-ordinators, a nurse should support the medical process and a co-ordinator should guide you through the process This was because they were were understaffed and using a less experienced sonogram operator After the short consultation with the doctor, they did the blood test Because this institute system is really slow and not organized so was it my body or their convenience (It took) Sher is a nightmare The numbers didn't even match  They are crooks I do not need medical advice from front desk woman When I moved to another clinic, they were willing and able to work with an immunology clinic in CA, where I shipped my blood regularly The doctor even changed the dosage of the meds after each visit sometimes changing them a tiny bit here and there At Sher, they rarely changed the dosage and they were less meticulous about timing, weekly tests, etcThe review below took the words out of my mouthI was also at another clinic before this one The nurses are also exceptional I would need to have them removed before in-vitro Because of the way my cycle fell I had to make an appt for Monday morning They couldn't confirm me when I called Friday but told me I would get a call Sunday  There is a lot of paperwork2 - No matter what they tell you, never wait for them to call you with an appointment time  YOU have to call THEM  Instead, they assign appointment times the afternoon before the day you're supposed to go in to the office  In therory they will call you by 5pm and tell you what time to be in the office the next day  I learned to call between 4 and 5pm to confirm my appointment timeMy partner and I had a really substandard experience with this office You need to book each monitoring appointments with the front desk even though the monitoring is routine and preset Before working with the team at Sher we had been to two other clinics in 3 years and had subpar experiences at both And, when you have an appt (which you will have a lot of!) you will see YOUR dr Not just a nurse or whoever is there that dayMy condition was highly unusual, they don't have a name form to as it is very rareThis facility is absolutely NOT CLOSED and it is first rate",4.6
138,Sher Institute For Reproductive Medicine,Protocol,Positive," When I asked why I wasn't informed that the biopsy was no longer usable I received the reply ""people don't usually wait that long"" To be specific, I waited 3 years to do the PGD because I thankfully had a successful cycle at Cornell After going through 6 cycles of IVF, yes you read that right 6 cycles, I only wish I switched to Cornell sooner and saved myself a lot of heartache and despairI went to an other practice (RMA NY ) 30 eggs, 29 fertilized, no medication after the retrieval, no blooding, shorter cycle! - I was running out of medication, they was nice enough to help me until i received by meds with EXPIRED MEDICATION I am sure they took the money and didn't test the embryo  You are not another patient in a factor setting like you would be at the big academic institutions (where I got my BFN with a PGS normal embryo) And the best part is that for the transfer he allowed my husband to come into the room with me! He was able to see the transfer and the embryo go into my uterus live I was told by my doctor that I had 2 frozen embryos for my next transfer They transferred 2 fresh and froze another 2 The most important thing, of course, is that I have my babyI've been waiting to write my review until after I delivered my beautiful healthy baby girl, which I did a couple of weeks ago And I have additional frozen embryos from my IVF cycles, which I'll transfer in hopes of bringing my daughter a sibling Also, for the record, I got pregnant at SHER, so I am not bitter I have since found out that not only is this not true but that if an egg is genetically determined to be a good egg, a woman in her 40s is almost as likely to get pregnant as a woman in her 20s The egg retrieval is reasonably easy, 2 weeks of tiny under the skin injections, but the transfer is far more intense with months of bigger injections into the muscle (Caused by them) and then was told instead of doing a fresh transfer I should wait a few cycles and do a frozen transfer SHER knew this and recommended a protocol, which I followed to a T After two years of trying, my husband and I almost gave up to have a baby, but we wanted to try once more at Sher with Dr Tortoriello, and miracle happened!! AMAZING!! I got pregnant I am at 11 weeks of my pregnancy and still have long way to go, but I am very happy and appreciate Sher and Dr Tortoriello  They also wanted 50,000 for their donor egg program I now have a beautiful seven month old son, which I conceived by going to Cornell I had enough eggs and that was not a problem We went through a process of trial and error figuring out which treatment was best for me and ultimately I got pregnant My first appointment with Dr Dicken went well, and I decided to continue my treatments with her I had to be very proactive and be involved in every single step and know every single detail to make sure that I am being treated properlyI wish I had found Sher first In the end, I had my fibroids removed and got pregnant with New Hope Fertility  Its okay to do this  but they have ostensibly dropped all further 'care' now that they have my money I highly recommend Sher and specifically under Dr O'Shaughnessy for any and all fertility needs I recently had a hysteroscopy performed by DrDicken and my uterus looks so much better after she removed all of the scar tissueDr Wang is very nice and that is the sole reason I decided to try thereSher is the best!!! At the age of 36 and after trying for over a year and a half and after 2 IVFs, 1 FET transfer, & 4 IUIs, we finally discovered Dr Dicken and this clinic On the second IUI, we got a POSITIVE pregnancy result for the first time ever!!!!! I am only 4 weeks pregnant, but all seems to be going wellSher Fertility and Dr T are the absolute best And, the best part - he was successful with us on our first IVF cycle! I can't recommend Sher and Dr T and his team enough I wish I had known of them sooner! He didn't want to just pump large quantities of drugs and getting a large amount of eggs, but he cared more about getting quality eggs He decided to use a different mixture of drugs that helped us produce quality eggs and he made it count as promised Just wish we had gone there in the first place It took three rounds of treatment with IUI and I now have a beautiful healthy baby boy thanks to Dr T and his team! Dr Tortoriello is aces! The RE before him was recommending surrogacy or adoption He was resisting doing an embryo transfer even though we had frozen embryos",4.6
139,Sher Institute For Reproductive Medicine,Protocol,Negative," After 4 rounds of IUI and 2 IVF with no results I did one IUI with gen next and GOT PREGNANT! There labs are old and can cause many issues within the processI hardly ever YELP but I am doing an update to say that I tried to send out the biopsy of my only surviving embryo at SIRM for PGD after three years of it being frozen and was told by Carey Dicken and the office manager that I no longer had the option to do PGD because the biopsy is now too old - They obviously failed at an other transfer I did with themAfter two previously failed IVF treatments by two different RE I chose to go to Dr T because he looks into immune issues I suffered 2 miscarriages as a result of their negligent practices Another huge problem with this clinic is that for the first embryo transfer they took far too long to transfer the embryo into my body The final issue I will share with you is that they told me that the genetic sequencing of the embryo is a waste of money I agree with the negative review on this page She messed up with my IUI timing Everyone knows that IUI is time critical I was so disappointed that I tried timed intercourse and it workedDrTortoriello made me pregnant!! I had developed Asherman syndrome after I lost my identical twin girls at 17 weeks of my pregnancy, and I had three uterus surgeries to remove my scar tissue I also tried north shore in manhasset and after a surgery, 4 iuis and a failed ivf nothing I did two rounds of unsuccessful IVF (two rounds of retrieval and two rounds of transfers) I wasted more that a year at Sher with no results and I am so sorry about it Mostly because my dad died and I would have wanted him to meet my son He said that he proposes we only transfer one embryo (we had talked about transferring two) and that there are risks associated with carrying twins at my age, etc I have never received a well formulated answer from her for the reasons of my multiple failures (I do get pregnant easily though, but always miscarry) Would give no stars but that is not an option  Coming to SHER for my IVF was a mistake  After my transfer, I was given NO instructions  Unfortunately, I had a chemical pregnancy and was not able to keep the pregnancy I was not impressed as I was looking for much thorough doctors since we were young and healthy couple trying to conceive after already unsuccessful IVF I had an HSG done and the result was both tubes were blockedWe came to the Sher institute after failed attempts at Cornell and Columbia clinics We went through 2 failed IVFs and one IUI and our attempt with Sher institute was our last try covered by our insurance Over the last six years I have met a lot of women struggling with IF",4.6
140,Sher Institute For Reproductive Medicine,Protocol,Neutral," After multiple IUI's and miscarriage, we decided to do IVF Why didn't I use my embryo in the first place you might wonder? Because I was down to the last of my savings and it would've cost almost as much to transfer that embryo at SIRM as it would to do a full donor cycle at Cornell - the Dr are not reliable I had to take medication during one week after the retrieval ( additional cost 1500$) to decrease the blooding, only 19 fertilized I noticed that 3 days after!!!!! Can you believe that, they gave me expired medication!- I got one of the eggs they retrieved transfered by RMA I was pregnant for 10 weeks Then we discovered the embryo has some genetic default which should have been discovered during the genetic testing they have done (very expensive)Dr T made it possible for me to get pregnant We did IVF with PGS and on my first attempt I got a BFP Now just waiting for my ultrasound i went to the Westchester office which closed down while under treatment Which at the day of my transfer we discovered I did not have 2 embryos but a morula and and early stage blast  Both which are unlikely to result in pregnancy  I wonder if I would have stayed with sher if they would have continued to lie to me about the quality of my embryos I had a professional doctor review my embryo results and NONE were considered to be viable for transfer  In other words, the don't comply with industry standards on viable embryos So I figured I will go back to Sher since I know how they operate The only place I used this card was at SIRM The embryo should not be outside of storage or the body for more than a few seconds, 30 seconds is a long time for this process, and for my first transfer it took a few minutes I don't know why they missled us? IVF is split into 2 halves, egg retrieval (out of you to be fertilized) and then the fertilized egg is transferred back into you However, next time I realized they did a genetic test through other company, about if my babies are going to have any genetic issues I was overstimulated and there for had fluid in my uterus (which would be another $5000 and the money shouldn't be my deciding factor) I said I believed in my body and why wouldn't we try the transfer because there was a possibility it would work I did the fresh transfer with another dr and the fluid was no longer present Dr Wang was the complete opposite My baby is almost one year old I did two IUIs and one timed intercourse with injectable cycle TI worked for me Then gave me lecture that how my egg will wait for 24 hours after ovulation so they can slide my appointment of IUI She also told me that ivf patients are priority for egg retrieval and my egg can wait Treatments were chosen based on their findings and now we have our son Because of my uterus condition, I was told to give up getting pregnant by many doctors at NYU and CHR  I had done several yrs of acupuncture, herbs and nothing before I came to Sher My first round of IVF ended in a chemical pregnancy after which the doctor came up with a new strategy that made all the differenceI should have written this a long time ago I had fibroids and Sher doctors were insisting that I have to have a surgery I even scheduled my surgery to remove fibroids but decided to get other opinions I went to NYU and Cornell and both doctors told me that they do not see any reason that the fibroids are causing infertility When I switched to Cornell, I realized that much higher standards exist I got pregnant with the first attempt at Cornel and with transferring only ONE embryo At Sher, the first round they transferred  one embryo and the second round two embryos So 1/1 at Cornell and 0/3 at Sher I am the same person with the same eggs and same husband and the same fibroids I went to Dr T when I was 38 after many rounds of IUI and two IVF with another clinicAfter two months on the waiting list, we got our appointment with Dr T I was told later by multiple Doctors that the fertility Dr should never have taken my money because I could not hold a pregnancy with my fibroids Night and day Never happened and it slipped my mind to follow up  Let me say that again He suggests right away the IVF and assumes various scenarios without any analysis I finally consulted with Dr Dicken and went thru 2 egg retrievals and several transfers at SIRM She insisted I have another done this time with canalization Even though it was a short period of time I'm now PREGNANT =-) This is actually the reason why we ended up having subpar thawed sperm for our first IUI at SHER (b/c it had been stored at Gramercy IVF before being transferred to Sher Dr Tortoriello understood our situation and decided to make it count His exact words 'You deserve at least one transfer if not more before going to surrogacy' I got pregnant on my first FET with him",4.6
141,Sher Institute For Reproductive Medicine,Cost,Positive," Well, turned out our anesthesia was one of the few things that could be covered by our insurance and the anesthesiologist was indeed in network They just care about the money  The only issue has been with the finance team -- they do not provide details invoices and very casually ask for a lot of money, without back-up documentation Well, RMA had a very complicated payment options  My husband and I met with Dr Dicken multiple times to strategize the best IVF plan for us given our medical issues, the cost our health insurance would cover, and what we could afford That said I know we would have had the same luck with any clinic Then to top it all off they just decided to start charging more money out of the blue for our embryo storage When certain medications wouldn't be covered by my insurance, they worked to see if there was an alternative that would beOh yeah, and it worked My husband and I were ready to give up after 3 years over thereI don't have anything bad to say about this place If your insurance covers some of the charge, make sure you are not being double charged by the insurance covered portion The doctors were so rude & they treated us like cattle! Stay away from RMA!!! Sher institute takes GHI IN NETWORK!!!! We only had to pay a copay for IUI & had we needed to do an IVF, it would have been covered except for $1,500 upfront",4.6
142,Sher Institute For Reproductive Medicine,Cost,Negative," I SWEAR I would think it was just me if I had not read the other reviews Well the damn specimen would've died by then They charge a ridiculous fee just for consultation You Basically had to pay for everything in front and then if you didn't have any fertilized eggs for example they would somehow refund you a percentage for what would have been a transfer At cornell, although I brought in all of my medical records, they made me do an ultrasound and pay for out-of-pocket $900 We started with 11 and ended up with 3, so losing 1 through carelessness is pretty epic I booked this place because I had some emergency issue about my health and it was the only place was available near my work So I went in for the following visit and was asked to pay more money No notification that things were changing just a bill saying we owe them more money for something we set up a monthly autopay for This wasted my whole cycle  Outrageous, and the insurance company and I are still fighting it  That included no pic of the donor I had fraudulent charges for check fees on dates where checks were never sent  I just don't care enough to do it We spent over $7k at RMA even though they had claimed to be in network!!! What a waste of $! We had also tried NYC IVF (Dr Azim) & his Gramercy IVF lab",4.6
143,Sher Institute For Reproductive Medicine,Cost,Neutral,"My husband and I have been trying to have baby for many years Month after month I was billed incorrectly Them comes to anesthesiologist which SHER hires for your procedures and it is SHER whom receives the payment I had 36 eggs retrieved- They charge you for everything None of the other places I've been to have such system Couple of times I ran out of medications and they would actually give me meds to cover me until I got my meds shipped I authorized a payment of $2,000, and a couple of days later there were a few charges to restaurants and Pro Flowers But billing?  Perhaps because if we had determined that more eggs were not viable they would not have been able to charge us for as many transfers and they would have made less money?My advice is to find a clinic that has not been bought as a commercial enterprise and is not run as a business So I obviously thought it was for my health issue I never asked for it or knew the blood test was for that Plus, I wasn't there for pregnancy!! Now this genetic testing company asks $1000 for this test What kinda response is that?! Then I was told the overcharge would be kept on file for future charges I said is there a balance on the accountThen I received a check in the mail with an arbitrary amount as a ""refund"" for being overchargedThen I got a bill for charges that would have been covered by the overpayment And back payments for an amount that doesn't even add upI've never had any issues with billing  That was the only way i opened up tp other possibilites  I was 1 of a million other patients  I was passed around between 7 or so doctors The Westchester location had a staff member attempt to put my signature on an insurance form  About anything  I don't know what the deal is because they have called me about other mattersDr Dickens is an angel!!!

147,Extend Fertility,Doctor,Positive,"  The office is conveniently located, the nurses get you in and out of the appointments fairly quickly (lots of blood tests and ultrasounds!), and both of the doctors I met with (Dr Klein and Dr Guarnaccia) were great  Dr Klein met with me for the consultation and I was impressed by how much time he spent with me going through the details of the process and answering all my questions He has the best bedside manners and always thoughtful as he explains everything that he's doing I'm a very detail oriented person and he was great with providing information without my having to ask Yamice would always recognize my voice when I called and greet me by name when I would come in for my appointments Dr Toledo was kind to schedule a call with me so that I could ask her questions about embryology Maha was always kind to confirm with me when she received my deliveries  ( based on my three times egg freezing experiences)Dont take me wrong, Dr Klein is very nice  And the result was better  I was single, and pretty ambivalent about having children, and found that I was pretty stressed about the prospect of having to worry about this as I potentially started a new relationship (after all, I didn't intend to be single my entire life!)  But overall, I was really happy with my results (turns out having PCOS made me produce a lot of eggs!)In January of 2018, I was diagnosed with some adenomyosis and possibly some endometriosis and I was like ""Well at least I have my eggs frozen""  I had met with one of the best doctors at NYU (and he was fantastic, nothing against him), but the overall experience at NYU felt very complicated Highly, highly recommend!! I have low AMH and DOR, and I was treated with the best care during the highs and the lows of my treatment I never felt like a number, and my doctor's and nurses actually cared about my outcomes--and did everything they could to support my success, even more so as an out-of-state patient",5.0

149,Extend Fertility,Doctor,Neutral," He also made himself available via email throughout the process, and he responded right away any time I emailed him a question Through it all, Dr Klein has been extremely patient with my numerous questions He's also very open minded to hear about my findings on the internet and discuss the subject matter Each one has been integral during my journey She followed up a couple of more times afterwards A few articles/videos were done about my experience There is also very little feedback about individual test results",5.0
150,Extend Fertility,Advice,Positive,"Dr Guarnaccia (Dr ""G"") is wonderful In 2019, I became an Expect Fertility client, as I was ready to begin my road to motherhood He truly listens to his patients And he always had hope As a patient, it's always nice when after given all of the ratios and numbers (which is a huge dream zapper), the doctor ends it with- it only takes one! It allowed me to keep the faith and stay optimistic She was very responsive and extremely helpful She truly cared  Don't get fooled by their promotions and sales pitch   They try to pump as much medication into you as possible, hoping to get the best results  So I just want to share the experience here   I hope it will help someone who is going through the same situation-- egg freezing I recommend Extend Fertility and Dr Klein to everyone, who would like an ""insurance policy"" for having children later in life  Conceiving natural was seeming pretty much 100% out of reach and whatever you do- don't go on the internet when stuff like that gets told to you  Feel free to check them out!fortuneIt's amazing how Extend manages to make this not-so-pleasant process such an empowering one Extend trusts that you have made the right decision for yourself, and even works with your health insurance for you! I cannot say enough good things I feel that egg freezing is a smart choice for any woman over 30, and Extend Fertility prices make this choice much easier I conducted a lot of research prior to choosing Extend, and Extend exceeds all expectations in regards to what one should be looking for when searching for the right fertility clinic I have already recommended Extend Fertility to friends who have asked me about my experience, and will continue to do so and share my positive experience with others Only positive comments to say - the entire team is extremely professional, candid, and accessible If you are looking to freeze your eggs, I would highly recommend attending one of their open house workshops and seeing for yourself Extend is one of the most affordable way to freeze eggs in the U I will recommend Extend to any woman I know who is interested in freezing I recommend giving Extend Fertility a try if you are thinking that egg freezing may be an option that you'd like to take I am a huge advocate for educating women about this option; having done this procedure at this incredible clinic makes it even easier to recommend",5.0

I've sent a few friends their way alreadyI had the best experience from start to finish working with Extend Fertility Everyone was so kind, professional, friendly, knowledgable and respectful and made the entire process extremely easy! Working with Extend to complete an egg freezing cycle was a very positive and productive experience for me All of the doctors, nurses and advisors were so transparent, kind, attentive and made the process as smooth and easy as it could have possibly been The facility is very clean and aesthetically pleasing as well, which also adds to the ease and comfort of the process I want to sincerely thank everyone at Extend Fertility for making the whole process such a positive one and for providing such excellent care and service! From the moment I stepped foot into the clinic, Extend Fertility staff eased both of those experiences From the Drs, to the nurses, to the support staff, the entire extend fertility family was patient and dedicated to me as an individual person and not just as another case walking through the door They patiently explained each step of the process and made it as easy as possibleThere were so many things I loved about my experience at Extend I went to several clinics before deciding where to freeze and am happy I chose Extend for a few reasons: (1) I really appreciated that I could go in for a consultation at Extend without paying anything(2) Extend only treats egg freezing patients, so in contrast to other fertility clinics where most of their patients are couples that are trying to get pregnant, when you are at Extend, everyone who is undergoing treatment is just like you It makes a huge difference But Extend did a great job of getting preferred pricing at two local pharmacies, and the long-term egg storage facility they work with is one of the cheaper ones too The first blood test AND the first preliminary appointment were totally free, requiring zero financial commitment until I made my decision I travel for a living, so my main concern was how to schedule my monthly cycle around my travel work schedule! The entire staff at Extend, from the receptionists to the nurses and doctors, understood my situation and adapted around it",5.0

Very rude and impatient )But the methods they use are so aggressive and ineffective  And the results are so poor They don't time well the ovulation Window  They just rigidly go by the 36 hours rule  I even got yelled by doctor G for asking about the reason )I only found out how these things are wrong after I went to New Hope for my third cycle this month  For example, they could have given me the wrong trigger shot medication if I didn't triple check with the nurse The nurses and doctors are always rushed and not easily accessible (only through the answering service)I can't say enough good things about Extend FertilityExtremely rude staff specifically a fertility specialist name Cara, although they are less expensive than RMA it isnt worth it with what you have to deal with , with the unprofessional ignorant staff there I was also nervous about the shots, so they let me come in for a second instructional session with one of the nurses",5.0
158,Extend Fertility,Clinic,Neutral," They had the most patience with me I had SO many questions  But it turned out to be very counterproductive and I am afraid its harmful to my body in the long run The procedure itself was a breeze The doctors are board certified, knowledgeable and experienced, and the nurses are professional Everyone I worked with from the first consultation to the retrieval date, provided incredible serviceThis is an incredible practice and facility Not only are they affordable, they're incredible people They went above and beyond, gave tips on how to minimize the cost of medicine, and FaceTime'd with me after hours when I needed a refresher on how to inject my medicine",5.0
159,Extend Fertility,Protocol,Positive," I highly highly recommend this practiceOverall very happy with the Extend Fertility process  I recently completed an egg freezing cycle with Extend and all went smoothly It started off in 2017 when I went through two rounds of egg freezing cycles at Extend Finally, my number one cheerleader through it allI wish someone had shared their experiences with Extend, so I could have skipped the 2 cycles with them, and saved my ovaries  I only got 50% of mature eggs the first time, and the second time half of the eggs magically disappeared ( I think they ovulated earlier) They use manupor unnecessarily  I was pretty skeptical about them at the beginning, and even wanted to go back to the extend The process that led to the procedure lasted for about 10 days and during that period of time I felt really well taken care ofI froze my eggs in August of 2016 and was very happy with my experience  So I decided to take all my savings and freeze my eggs with Extend Fertility  I was able to retrieve 30 eggs, 20 of which were viable/mature enough to freeze and the retrieval process was pretty painless (I couldn't laugh or cough without a little pain for the next couple of days) and flew back to Austin, TX with no issues a couple days after the procedure  I think freezing my eggs allowed me to relax and not worry so much of my impending infertility  It also allows me to have 33-year-old eggs if I ever have the desire to put myself through another pregnancy (as of right now, no thanks)  I'm happy I froze my eggs and it was well worth the investment, even though I happened to conceive naturally (they say this is NOT uncommon)An important thing to know is that egg freezing fertility medications carry significant short term side effects for some women I wish I was better prepared for this - my ""Fertility Specialist"" (initial sale / coordinator) downplayed the fact that it might be ""normal"" for me to throw up multiple times per day during the treatment The whole setup caters to women looking to freeze their eggs, as opposed to most places which have traditionally only focused on infertilityChoosing Extended Fertility was one of the best decisions of my life If I had to do it all over again: I would choose Extend hands down",5.0

171,Reproductive Medicine Associates of New Jersey RMANJ,Advice,Positive," RMA's strong research guides treatment, saving you from having to research options such as embryo glue or assistive hatching But you'll save yourself a lot of stress if you double-check your drugs immediately You can't return online meds, so please check prescriptions prior to ordering Another option is to contact daycares in Basking Ridge to see if any accept children for drop in care   Doctors perform monitoring ultrasounds, which is extremely helpful if you have any questions during IVF     RMA has excellent success rates, and I didn't write this review to discourage you from choosing them Best of luck to you!   It's just that it's not worth wasting time (especially over 35) with other things because time is ticking and the best shot is IVF   So my concern was not finding a doctor that would help us conceive naturally - my only concern was finding the best IVF clinic I could afford   RMA had a financing option that helped make it doable, and after much research on the SART website, the CDC website, and the Fertility Authority website, we were confident that RMA-NJ was the best clinic in our area for freeze-all IVF cycles   And I do believe I am getting great care  I'm not sure why the one reviewer was surprised at a message being left- you were allowed to choose whether or not to have messages left (regardless of their news)  This is NOT a waste of money or time if you are realistic  As much as I wish it was a perfect happy outcome for everyone, it's not  You can't blame everyone who's trying to help it's called the  RMANJ will help you along that pathIt was wonderful experience, I would do it again Dr Eli Rybak is Friendly and caring I suggest you definitely pay the extra $$$ on getting the eggs tested or there's a good chance you will have a miscarriage and have to go through the entire ordeal over which sucks If you have any questions please contact me and I'll let you know what I went through :)Note: I have 250 unit of Gonal-F that is useless for me now, if anyone needs plz feel free to contact I live in NJ, PiscatawayHi, I am not writing the review out of frustration, it's just a feedback You are truly a number They are so concerned about patient care that some ""nurse"" you don't even know leaves you messages that both your tubes are blockednow that's great bedside mannerand don't be fooled And I believe it all comes down to the following: If you feel more comfortable with your doctor calling you and interacting only with you at most of your appointments through your ivf journey, then you need a smaller fertility office In terms of doctors, I dealt with a few of them and I clicked with some of them better than with others, especially Marcy Maguire, my doctor I have a beautiful healthy daughter who is soon turning 3 years old And they certainly try to do a good job for all What matters is that they do a good job Can they improve I'm some aspects, of course Not only is it difficult to get a hold of anyone who knows anything (you'll wait on hold, then wait with a nurse to get a hold of someone who knows anything and then you'll end up just leaving a message after all this--what should have been a 2 minute call takes 10) but they are incredibly inept/disorganized  Even though I want to get pregnant, ironically I hope that I don't as I don't trust their competence and fear that any child created would have development issues because of what RMA did  We'll be going back for sure  I am writing this review about my experience, not out of frustration for lack of success (although that is true), but out of frustration for how my husband and I are treated by RMA  We aren't looking for a best friend but we are looking to be treated like human beings with feelings, questions and concerns Don't warn you of procedure expectations I am not bitter, I am pregnant but just don't want to see others go through what I did with RMA Go elsewhere where you are treated better and not as a number!RMA is one of the top IVF practices in the country It's pretty much them, CCRM in Colorado and a handful of others leading the major developments in the field So you are getting the most advanced care you can get, probably anywhere Always a pleasure to deal with him, even during morning monitoring when you know he's busy But that's with the clarity of hindsight They want to give you all this stuff because it MIGHT help",4.6

Every (and I mean every) interaction with RMA is infuriatingPlease don't get me wrong, it's clear that they know what they are doing when it comes to fertility, but we don't feel like they treat the person  Unfortunately I will not be returningSurprised by all the negative reviews Barely return your calls/no communication4 On 3 separate occasions either he or a staff MD, suggested to my wife that if IVF didn't succeed for us, to take our funds to go on vacation & try on our own to conceive Bad experience",4.6

 I knew right after meeting with Dr Dougherty that I was in good hands and have trusted everything they have told me  The convenience of morning bloodwork/ultrasounds allowed me to never be late for work  My specific doctor also called me later that day to check up on me as well as the following day  This place is amazing and I will be forever grateful to them  You have to trust that their treatment plan is individualized to you based on their recommendations But they were always available to me and helped me with care They took utmost care of me As long as they are doing everything in their capacity, we shouldbe thankful to them Our heartful thanks to the everyone from this place  Pick a less crowded clinic and get better care Anistologyst did a great job, I was ready to go as soon as I opened my eyes This Place is wonderful  They have too many patients and u are treated as a number The doctors were very nice and very convincing that they only wanted the best for meI switched to another doctor at another fertility center (Dr Nasseri at Valley Fertility Center) They listened to what I wanted You really are just a number to them I would advise you to go to a smaller clinic where you are treated like a human being All the money that is spent there they should have more respect for their patients Never acknowledged their mistake You may have an appointment or two close to home, but for the important stuff like egg retrieval, etc Find someplace where they treat you like a human and not a lab rat The staff at RMA, from the wonderful team of nurses to Sonia (will always have a spot in our hearts) at the front desk, were always so encouraging every step of the way It made us feel like everyone was in our corner and pulling for a positive outcome It got even more difficult watching multiple new classes of hopeful parents in the waiting rooms with us All of the hardship, the emotions, and the sacrifice that felt like they would never end are now replaced by laughter, hugs, kisses, and the love of our little girl Like any big office running a large complex operation, they have a system to get things running smoothly and you, as a patient, are part of the system They have the resources, and the results to prove that they have indeed helped a lot of people Some nurses are sweeter than others, some are more experienced in dealing with human emotions during this difficult process some of us have to go through They are there to help us conceive Some nurses express empathy better than others They have managed to streamline this ivf process in a way that provides the best results for the biggest number of peopleTo make a VERY long story short, do yourself a favor and avoid RMA (specifically the West Orange office) at all costs I've now switched practices and it's a world of difference to deal with people you can easily reach, who want to handle everything for you and have it done so properly so that you don't have to do their job for them  Then at the end of the conversations will say that they care and only want what's best for you   It's frustrating to feel like you are playing a game of telephone when it comes to your medical care  I have started asking around, and have been told that it's more typical to be able to call a clinic and actually speak to someone as well as to have a way to communicate with your doctor (ex: by email) RMA is like night and day  They are professional, empathetic, communicative, consistent and reliableI am a patient with RMA-NJ and love the attention and care that they give  I may have had a positive experience because it ended with a baby, however during the whole process I thought they were extremely organized considering the amount of patients  I originally went to them because their reputation as ""the best"" and I was never disappointedbut I also felt that if I didn't understand something, there were approachable nurses that could help either by phone or in personAll Doctor's were very professional!!!  I can't remember my main nurse's name, I don't think she is there anymore because the names on the website don't look familiar, but I remember the nurses in the recovery room in Morristown were very pleasant!

You are just another patient on a conveyor belt to them They are at fault and spending $50 co-pay on everyday ultra sound is no joke besides the emotional torture that resulted in simply cancelling my cycle worrying about multiple pregnancyThe place if horrible Like most of the patients we were already very frustrated, and quite hopeless when we first walked into RMA office in Morristown There are many people there going through the same troubles as you And some nurses and doctors are better than others at relaying messages over the phone about lab results that are sadly negative I was a wreck and she seem to feel this was the right moment to send me off to find some number to some pharmacy, etc etc Some doctors walk in and are all focused on your transfer and don't really smile, and some treat you very attentively and are very sweet But how you can control every staff member's reaction and way of communicating at all times any facility is a bit tricky I would tell every patient the following, for me the worst part to control through this journey was my emotions, my anxiety, and my stress They have misfiled codes with my insurance company causing me to have to sort everything out for them, it now appears they've lost blood tests and all the while they've been incredibly inefficient on other fronts   And when I say negative, they would say that your going to have a miscarriage  They stink!  There are no redeeming qualities for RMA  I should have immediately looked elsewhere when my first experience with RMA was them threatening to cancel my appointment if they didn't receive about 10 pages of personal information before the first appointment  They are rude and will bully you by saying that if you deviate from their recommended procedures they will stop working with you  There are some hiccups that I can warn against, but was a smooth practice for nearly of it  We are still patients there but are seriously considering other clinics It only makes RMA look worse in my eyes and any recommendations I would ever give would be to go to IRMS at St Are only in it for the MONEY! You are nothing but a number they can care less about I called my nurse, and they apologized and said she spoke to my doctor and they were shocked they did that and that for now on the $35 fee was waived I called my nurse in charge , no answer, still no call back There is NO COMMUNICATION! This is just one of many stories Our experience was awful I could go on with other examples of our concerns but this place has taken too much of our time & hard earned money already Not surprisingly, they are one of the highest volume clinics in the country, over 3,000 IVF cycles a year when I went there It doesn't feel like a factory even though they are dealing with vast numbers of patients If it is ever discovered that these interventions are hazardous to the offspring -- and some such as CCS are so new they haven't been studied much -- I will feel terrible",4.6
179,Reproductive Medicine Associates of New Jersey RMANJ,Clinic,Neutral," RMA rescinded the prescription, and sent it to a different pharmacy I insisted on speaking to a supervisor, who checked and saw that the deliveries hadn't been picked up yet The RMA offices open earlier than 6, so if you get there earlier you can be the first patient in line when monitoring starts at 6Most of the nurses I dealt with seemed extremely knowledgeable, and can answer most of your questions  Every ultrasound is done by a doctor, not a nurse   They know what they are doing They are very knowledgeable and they know what they are doing Their staff, doctors and nurses are very cordial The staff if very cordial  Spent months waiting in line for everything from blood draws to saline sonograms Now they are trying again to upsell me the IVF I don't know what on Earth they were thinking! They are butchersyou'll have to face going up and down deadly 287 early in the morning to wait for hours Going to our first meeting was a big step RMA is simply too big But because of this very reason, you have an assigned nurse that follows you case, calls you almost every other days, a computerized system that gives everyone involved instant access to detailed records, and several doctors putting their brains together to discuss your case However, for me, all the doctors I dealt with were extremely focused on their jobs, and on what they were doing I went back to RMA to try to have a second baby and this time it simply did not work RMA is a reputable business   They say to stay positive when almost all interaction with them was negativeYou have to know how each part of the RMA organization works as well as the lingo as RMA takes no accountability and will have you driving the process instead of them   Our experience has been that we can only communicate with nursing via voicemail and can never actually get someone on the phone  I felt that online training for the shots was sufficient My nurse in charge told me to go to the office where they would do it for me Why would you ever say that to a woman who tied her tubes ? Maybe they should actually prepare for the consult by reading the file ?!?! A factory in every sense of the word",4.6

If we had stayed with RMA, we would never have been blessed with our two little angels I've had problems staying pregnant and it turned out that I definitely needed to do IVF in order to have a healthy baby I was 38 when I first went in, now I'm 39 when I'll be giving birth The entire process was very tiring, taking shots in your stomach and giving blood almost every other day and popping pills and having my husband put a needle in my back every night for months was definitely draining But worth it :) we got lucky with the first batch of eggs they took out of methey took out 23 eggs (which is a lot) and when fertilized only 2 of those eggs were good We still have another boy embryo waiting for us when or if we're ever ready for another child They merged with IVFNJ and I had a better time dealing with them From our first discussion, Dr Forman educated us on all of the risk factors that we faced and helped us weigh the best way to achieve parenthood Unlike the lucky couples that were successful the first try we had a few more stumbles IVF seemed to be the most thoughtful approach considering her tubes tied & now age 43 & very healthy Dr Berg came very highly recommended I would've preferred to have more discussions of the latest research with him but I was still very happy I also negotiated with them to do a more natural-style cycle that wouldn't involve any medication after the transfer) All embryos get extended culture, assisted hatching and 84% get ICSI For me, I wanted proof that it would definitely help before I exposed myself or my embryos to it That said, I still wish I hadn't caved to their pressure on ICSI and CCS",4.6

I should have listened my husband and not buy another 300 units of Gonal-F as my estrogen level was already high but my dr still wanted me to take a 50unit dose They will cut you up so much so that IVF is your only option They don't like to do multiple embryos unless it is necessary I had the meds/ needles but I was having a hard time with administering only the progesterone shots ( all others in the belly were no big deal) I couldn't reach my butt Had I known how well we would do, I think I would've gone to a lower-tech clinic and not done extended culture, ICSI, CCS, etc",4.6

So, two gals told me about Dr Orris, how he help get them pregnant via IUI; he didn't push them into doing the IVF procedure since he thought it wasn't necessary and all they needed was an IUI to get pregnant I was past the IUIs and went with Dr Orris' protocol and had a healthy baby at 41!! I am now 44 and had a healthy baby because of him and his team! Dr Orris is the BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I always felt that I was under exceptional care Dr Glassner was very confident and direct with his plan of action pending my test results Dr Glassner laid out the options for my care and based his recommendations on my family planning goals  I appreciated the way the options were presented to my husband and me with our needs in mind  Thank you MLF!  We are so fortunate to have a beautiful baby girl thanks to Dr Glassner and his excellent team Three successful pregnancies later, we express our gratitude to Dr Glassner and his staff everyday He helped us through each pregnancy and never lost hope His office staff is warm, welcoming and so pleasant Thank you, Dr Glassner and staff, for making our family complete I was treated with such kindness thereMy experience at Main Line Fertility with Dr Glassner and staff was amazing From the beginning of my IVF treatment I was told everything looked good and was going fine Dr Brasile went over all possible options regarding medications and answered my questions regarding other ""natural"" remedies thoroughly and honestly and discussed side effects and potential plans going forward depending on many scenarios Not once did I feel rushed through an appointment, or like I had unanswered questions I've even gotten to appointments early and bumped into the Dr in the parking lot and she recognized me by face and name and pleasantly chatted as we walked to the office together",3.923076923076923

Don't be embarrassed or shy, she's seen it all! Sue is a doll, but a little rough at first - get to know her, ask her questions - again, a wealth of knowledge My doctor doesn't seem to even remember who I am, and I often have to remind him of certain conditions that he forgets I have Don't worry, she did this to the insurance company agents as well What I did expect was that I would receive the appropriate time and care that I deserve as a patient at this practice I believe that Dr Glassner is most likely talented serving patients who are the 'toughest' cases- the ones he finds especially interesting, unique or challenging This is a large practice,  so you must expect to be treated like a number- therefore, you need to demand attention to receive the appropriate care that is best for you and your family You need decide how comfortable you feel with this approach Dr Glassner has a quirky sense of humor once you get to know each other  She gets down to business right away and doesn't waste any time  Dr Brasile is energetic and her enthusiasm and positive outlook rubs off on you when you may be at a very frustrating point in your journey NEVER let the odds deter you from doing what you know in your heart you should do Also, talk about this with your friends, family, and any one who will listen, because you will LEARN you are not alone NEVER let the odds deter you from doing what you know in your heart you should do  On my initial visit, Dr Glassner assured me that I would be able to get pregnant within the year, with some work  The second round of IUI, we achieve success!  The billing can be difficult to understand   Ensure you know the billing POC and where to contact her He is an amazing and compassionate man They are optimistic and celebrate every positive sign with you I enjoyed visiting their office  After a year of hoping/trying -we are expecting a baby in August:-)  I would recommend them to anyone!!

He made me continue on Clomid and after the second round which was just one round after the ""assessment"" round,, I suffered a rare side effect from the drug which is a thinning of the uterine lining Then two days before my surgery they tell me I haven't been responding to the medication and that my cycle is cancelled",3.923076923076923

My main takeaway from this experience - do not go alone to an HSG! My husband and I were then told on our next visit that our absolute only chance of conception was IVF My husband and I left stunned with disbelief that creating life has come down to this type of commercialization  I will always remember their cheers when I finally ""graduated"" with my successful pregnancy  But always, once I was seen, I was treated with professional courtesyI've had a good experience with Dr Barnhart and his nurse after switching from Main Line Fertility due to canceled cycles Although my IVF pregnancy ended in miscarriage, he was a pleasant RE to work with His nurse showered me with compliments and sympathy after the lossDr Coutifaris performed my retrieval and showed his sense of humor by writing the number of embryos retrieved on my hand  In my experience, the fellows are thorough, communicative with me and the attending physician and compassionateThis is meant to be scathing, and not meant for Dr Butts, whom I wish was our assigned doctor, and a few very kind nurses We could almost never get in touch with a doctor or nurse when we wanted to, and the times we could were rushed off the phone Go to a clinic with human decency during this incredibly emotional, trying time My main Dr was Dr Barnhart who was wonderful, but I received care from Dr Butts, Dr Dokras, and Dr Coutafaris (name misspelled), who's the head doctor Keeba the biller is also very approachable and helped me with wrongly filed bills  Dr G was also a gem when helping us work through some less than typical situations that arose  That was incredibly appreciated during what is a very emotional processMy interaction with one of the doctora as this practive left me feeling dismissed and unvalued  While I could have been more comfortable with this arrangement if I felt that I had easy access to my nurse or doctor in other ways, I felt disconnected from my care and without power to ask simple questions and get feedbackPenn Fertility Care has been knowledgeable, informative, and flexible with my husband and I as we navigated a very tricky fertility process",5.0

240,Penn Fertility Care,Clinic,Positive," Individually, many of the nurses, doctors, residents, and receptionists are extremely competent and kind, however as a system, the place is run like the DMV in the 1980's (Fun Fact her tubes not blocked, these goofs can't apparently figure out their own test) So for months they would have my wife come into office 4-6's times a month to monitor the size of the follicles The nurse looks at us and says, well come back into 2 more days and we will check again My experience at Penn Fertility was very mediocre at best Funny how I was pregnant without any assistance within 2 weeks of that consultation The doctors we dealt with at Penn were excellent at this The first chapter is all you need to read to understand what is happening at Penn Fertility CareI first would like to say that I mostly went to the 8th/ Walnut offices (except on holidays or weekends when I went to 3701 Market St)  I felt like they were compassionate and empathetic, and their support staff was excellent The blood draws were always painless at 8th/Walnut, and the nursing staff was professional and compassionate  You can train people to do their jobs efficiently, but you cannot train people to be as loving and caring as those women were to me  I loved how honest the doctors and nurses were- at some fertility practices, they are all ""sunshine and roses"", and while I appreciate that some people need a team that will tell them gentle lies to make them feel better, I needed a team who was going to be honest about my chances, and cut to the chase  Although, I really only went there on holidays and weekends, so they may have had a staff during the week who was also fabulousThey are not helping, they are destroying your reproduction system with a lot of bills too They tell you a sample must get there within an hour so why is that not the case this time???!!!! On another occasion I had a nurse laughing when we were talking about my infertility We were referred by Penn Fetal Medicine who we had a fantastic experience with We have had an amazing experience at the other fertility center There are many great facilities out there that will treat you with the respect and care you deserveThere are actually two head receptionists, Madeline and Teresa- both who have been incredibly kind to me in my many interactions in person and over the phoneYes- I have waited over 25 minutes on occasion, but that is NOT the norm  These fellows are all currently physicians in the field and they have wonderful bedside manner- something that is EXTREMELY important if you are a fertility patient  However, I have found that seeing more doctors has been great for me, as they are working as a team to care for me At that, my husband and I went to Shady Grove Fertility and are thrilled with the switchI've switched from MainLine Fertility to here and it was a wise choice I would've given 5 stars if the wait time was better and they offered 7 aI received respect and superb care from the front desk staff to the doctors Some of them actually contain valuable points, now that I am a patient there myself With that, they are pleasant, their heart is in the right place, and their system is overall effective That means, that my airhead nurse just did not bother to check until it was less than one day before the procedure, on a Sunday afternoon Honestly, that was a bit too much to take With that, they still achieve results, and are the closest group for Center City people geographically which becomes important when you do US and bloodwork every other day And they are amazing!!! I never have to wait more then 5 minutes in the waiting room The nurse that takes my blood is AMAZING!!! I never feel it in or out and never get a bruise! They treat you with the most respect and care I have never experienced doctors actually take the time to get to know you and really care about you! I have had NO health problem after donating!!!

Even though I had done the work to get them open, I still had a hard time believing it  But I always waited for ages at the Market St location- including one day when I was completely forgotten about when I was there for a monitoring appointmentThey are not that great as I thought They are so unprofessional The nurses there are not friendly at all as I want to know the ultrasound results as the clomid mess up my uterus and ovary, they said why you wanted to see the ultrasound results, go home, a nurse will call you and tell you everything This place needs some serious sensitivity and professionalism training We were shocked and disappointed with the lack of knowledge, attention and sensitivity that we experienced here The receptionists were often rude, unintelligent and unhelpfulThe final straw: A test showed that a Fallopian tube might have a blockage, meaning the the procedures we had done were quite possibly a complete waste of time, tears and money: and the doctor NEVER told meIt is just cute how all negative reviews of this practice are dismissed under ""Not recommended"" Prepare to a lot of stress and omissionsAbsolutely horrible The wait here is simply unprofessional and uncalled for  To deal with unpleasant receptionists, and then sit in rooms alone for 30-90mins waiting for a doctor or nurse is  incredibly frustrating If you can, avoid The center city location at all costs  I felt completely alone and unmonitored  Why?  The wait can be terrible - never less than 25 minutes and sometimes up to an hour  At my previous clinic, I usually waited less than 10 mins and my worst wait in 4 months was 30 minutes (for which they were very apologetic) The other reason for my low rating is the receptionist  The main receptionist at 3701 Penn Fertility Care is one of the nastiest women I have ever met",5.0
242,Penn Fertility Care,Clinic,Neutral," You will call and not receive calls back If you have specific medical concerns, you will need to remind every single medical ""professional"" of them, because they will not read your chart That's the first and last time I've ever seen that doctor Now once again with the revolving door of nurses I work in sales for a living, I never go into a meeting with a client not knowing every piece of info we have on them  They are primarily sales pl not likeDocs normally are There was nothing to rave about at this clinic The communication at this place just isn't what it needs to be barnhart and apparently I only spoke couple times before I start the ivf program and after that everything is all nurse The words ""you get 5 doctors for the price of 1"" actually came out of the mouth of Dr Butts  Over all of my treatments, I got to know the women who did the ultrasounds, the blood draw staff, and the nurses  The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars, by the way, is because I didn't feel the same amount of professionalism at the Market St location In fact, nobody will tell youDO NOT GO HERE!!! I went for an IUI only to be told 20 minutes later that a doctor was not there and that I needed to go to the city  I have been a patient at the office for two years  On most visits, including visits to get blood work, I have only waited about 5 minutesThe reason you do not always see the same doctor is that UPenn is a teaching hospital and this office has a fellowship program for doctors who are becoming instructors They ran the standard battery of tests, charged us twice for most, and never explained anything lab time in their officeThe overall level of service there is VERY uneven ""Stay on 450 units"", when your dose is actually 300 units, so PREPARE TO DOUBLECHECK their every step Especially when you have to do this multiple times in a week  We went there for about 8 months and they barely ran any tests on me or my husband  I only saw the doctor once or twice, usually it was the nurse, and the dr  Very little oversight But, since they really didn't have much sway in my regular visits with this office, I had to give 1 star  Maybe this isn't a big deal for most doctor's offices, but for fertility testing that occurs every other day, you need to be able to get in and out quickly  In most cases, I was only getting blood work done (that took less than 2 minutes) They have also been individualized in their billing approaches-- they explain bills and ask you in person about them when you come in rather than just receiving a random disconnected bill The nursing staff is the same way",5.0
243,Penn Fertility Care,Protocol,Positive," My wife comes in and yay follicle on the left side Well this is interesting because 2 days prior she apparently had no follicles on the right side  That was our last visit We chose a different fertility clinic, one that's highly recommended Also figures out my wife's tube wasn't blocked  I definitely wouldn't return to Penn fertility Dr Shah had a MUCH better understanding of how to approach diminished ovarian reserve Despite the odds against us, our healthy son was born last month due to the care we received from Penn I did feel a bit like a science project as on my first visit I had a ton of blood taken for testing and a transvaginal ultrasound and was scheduled for an HSG the next day I will have to say the procedure was actually done very quickly and smoothly with no pain, which it is apparently rare not to have pain, which I would later learnI looked into other options on my own and proceeded with many types of natural therapies Now it has been a couple months and we are crossing our fingers and toes for a positive test result As I want to know what the polyps are, no body would like to tell me Dr Barnhart switched my protocol, which was successful I was treated like just a number - get the tests then straight to IUI I'm expecting a positive pregnancy test next week At first, I gave the place the nickname ""Hot mess with a happy ending""We are very pleased with Penn Fertility  We ultimately had a successful pregnancy on the first try and had a baby within a year of our first visit to the clinic  Even though I am not prusing IVF, and I will believe that the practice is one of the best in the country, I would not recommend Dr Sondheimer",5.0
244,Penn Fertility Care,Protocol,Negative," My wife chose Penn and unfortunately I didn't read the google and yelp reviews At no point was this explained that it would essentially be billed as a surgery or a procedure So after the HSG, they determined that my wife had a blocked tube She doesn't have a medical history that would lead to this happening and they offered no explanation how this would occur 2 days later and now the right side is dominate So now my wife is apparently right side dominate this month So 2 days later back in the office and now magically the left follicle has disappeared and they don't know if my wife ovulated Then the nurse thinking my wife's right tube is blocked says, hey maybe we try the iui this month So we should waste a procedure that we have a limited number of that won't work???? Also you don't even know if she already ovulated is a huge disappointed for us, we just done with eggs retrieval on september 2017 but the embryo didn't last to blastocyst that's mean no embryos to transfer and no partial refund either according  they policy agreementWithout going into too much detail, let's just say that due to our age and due to the nature of our problem, we probably had around a 20-30% chance of carrying a pregnancy to full term The HSG performed showed that both of my fallopian tubes were blocked  I went for almost three years- multiple IUIs, and several losses actually the doctor is lack of the basic knowledge and scripted clomid he should not since I have thyroid disorder and fibroid, Then, as I took the clomid twice, got heavy bleeding, two cys (one is very big 3 cms), and no ovulation waited for three months to get my period back, and fibroid grew crazily after took clomid, FSH is doubled, My AMH is dropped by 60% (clomid speeded up using my egg reserve) As I called the nurse to notify the severe side effect, heavy bleeding and belly pain) and asked if I could stop the clomid, she said continue and take some ibuprofen if feel pain In fact, the doctor should not script the hormone for me because levothyroxine  for my thyroid disorder should not be taken with clomid, which won't lead to ovulation and actually result in heavy bleeding We would not recommend this facility Unfortunately, this is not the one of them We had three failed IUI procedures with them; each time Penn charged us a co-pay and $150 for a ""specimen thaw"" which is part of a co-pay at other fertility clinics Though we left the practice in December, we received several harassing, enormous bills, which we have just resolved With severe endo, and issues with high estrogen and low ovarian reserve at 34-yrs-old, Dr Dokras transferred 2 grade 1 8 cell embryos Or so I thought when less than 24 hours before my last retrieval they told me they have no donor sperm prepared for me  We interviewed several fertility clinics and ultimately chose Penn and could not be happier that we did  We are already extremely distraught after experiencing miscarriages, and failed IUI'sPenn fertility is absolutely terrible",5.0
245,Penn Fertility Care,Protocol,Neutral," I've bumped up my star rating to 3/5 as a result They make my wife take a HSG test They tell us come back 2 days later so we can measure the follicle again  WeHave an appointment at Mainline fertility w Dr GlassnerMy wife took the shot at 5 PM Zero responsewhat!! I mean if I knew it from the beginning I would not start my ivf program, we gonna fix our issue first and continue after that We researched and decided to switch to Penn I had mostly normal other results, but because I was 38 I should hurry into the process We stayed for the IVF lecture that night I could feel the changes in my body and my period This past February (1 year later) I scheduled another HSG with my gynecologist When I didn't return for a 7 week ultrasound, she checked up on me I've also worked with Dr Butts before for my laparoscopy Especially to those with endometriosis We had and continue to have a very high opinion of Penn Fetal Medicine After our initial appointment with her, we decided to go to another fertility center in Philadelphia I'm 4 days past my 3 day embryo transfer Dr Dokras let me view the screen during my transfer and explained everything step-by-step Again, in the very end, they found the sperm and did the procedure, but until the last minute, gowned up and with the IV in, I did know if the procedure is still happeningI am an egg donor there  We are a same-sex couple that needed an egg donor and surrogate  Whenever the discussion of IVF came up, and I informed this dr that it was not an option for me- he would shut down didn't even call me after I had an HSG  They do not do blood tests or ultrasounds throughout the month",5.0
246,Penn Fertility Care,Cost,Positive," Fun surprised when a 2400 dollar bill shows up because of our deductible  They wouldn't tell us the price of any fertility treatments ( not a range, not an average, no idea whatsoever ever of costs) until or unlessWe completed thousands of dollars in tests wThemMy insurance required that I go to Penn Fertility Care, so I had no choice",5.0
247,Penn Fertility Care,Cost,Negative,"2016: University of Pennsylvania Fertility is a disaster I almost lost my shit and snapped at this woman Magically my co-pay is 40 per visit and they don't charge us double Seriously run the fuck away from this placeAfter getting the run around from MainLine, who could've changed my protocol immediately but figured they milk the money off my insurance since it paid for IVF, Dr Barnhart reviewed my history and changed my protocol and everything went smoothly",5.0
248,Penn Fertility Care,Cost,Neutral, They're 100% accurate We started with penn sometime in the summer of 2018 Doing research the avg price for an HSG in Philadelphia is 400-600 Somehow at Penn it cost 4-5x the avg in the same city So every single visit we were being charged 120 dollars We get approved for iui treatments from my insurance And the bottom line I went there in February of 2016 We were given a sales pitch that would make a used car salesman salivateThe blood test and ultra sound exam will be charged separately and very expensive They will miscommunicate with each other  My fiancé and I have been attending Penn Fertility for a year now,5.0
