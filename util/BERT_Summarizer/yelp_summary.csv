0,Columbia University Fertility,doctor," We were seen by Dr Paula Brady at the Columbia University Clinic She is an excellent doctor, who treats her patients at a very personal level Dr Brady took care of us and everything worked great for us The entire team of Dr Brady is very helpful, professional and listens to patient concerns with care and these issues are properly taken care offI wish I could give them more than 5 stars and especially to Dr Brady, who is an excellent consultant and above all a great human beingI would especially mention that even during this stressful Corona pandemic, she really managed everything so well and she ensured that I wasn't effected by it in anyway, for which I am really grateful to her She is an expert of her field and very knowledgeable care provider in her field of expertise One can be inspired in many ways from her We felt honored to have been her patients She makes you very comfortable during the entire procedure and ensures that you are not stressed during any phase in any way So, when I felt low or felt nervous on some issue, I would contact Dr Brady and she would reply that ""it's fine"" or ""it will get better"" or ""its pretty normal"" made me feel great, even if I were not feeling good earlier The way Dr Brady used to say those things made my body believe that ""its pretty normal"" and it is very important in this treatmentThere aren't enough words to describe how amazing Dr Eric Forman and the staff at Columbia Fertility Center are My husband and I have been trying to conceive for years but was not having any luck It all changed when we met Dr Forman Dr Forman broke down the process step by step for each procedure and made sure all was understood Dr Forman always took his time explaining, answering our questions, and never made us feel rushed I was able to contact Dr Forman at any time and always received a quick reply whether by email or by phoneThank you, Dr Forman, for helping us become parents of an amazing baby boy The entire stuff was always smiling Everyone was on point I didn't have to remind or explain anything to anyone It felt like everything was done for us I had no confusion I knew what to do next every step of the way Long story short, after several months we had a successful IVF in the first try :) Every doctor we worked with was incredible but our favorite by far was Dr Brady We are definitely coming back for baby #2 :) Dr Brady was incredibly knowledgeable, professional, supportive and super sweet She was always in touch and her entire team was on top of everything After such outstanding level of care and professionalism I decide to switch all my doctors to Columbia doctors!  Over the course of two years there were many who I interacted with and I would call out their names but I don't want to leave anyone out! It was a happy day to ""graduate"" and be released to my ob gyn with hugs and high fives from the staff and Dr Forman!  Fast forward to almost a year later and I'm a first time parent to a happy and healthy baby girl thanks in part to the efforts of the former CWRC aka Columbia University Fertility I'm happy to have chosen Columbia to address my fertility issues years ago! She's a caring and compassionate doctor She was very supportive of me going forward with IVF, so we felt very confident under her careMy husband and I decided on Columbia after stumbling upon an insanely high review of Dr Forman via a blog post (and then further review stalking on Fertility IQ) Dr Forman and the entire Columbia Fertility staff are the nicest people you'll ever come across throughout your fertility journey The wait time for appointments is either nonexistent or extremely low considering other doctors offices I've been too Dr Forman is an open book and has the fastest response rate of pretty much anyone I've ever emailed with, period No matter what route you end up taking to get pregnant, there are a ton of appointments involved A million thank you's to every single person we crossed paths with at Columbia- we are forever grateful for all of you and will definitely be back for baby #2! We've been with Columbia this entire time, and couldn't be happier with our decision Dr Sinem Karipcin (Dr K) was positive, warm, and laughed with us through the good and bad times! I could not recommend Columbia more The only downside is that I WISH that Dr K could be my OBGYN and deliver my baby!  Spends a lot of time detailing plans but then doesn't actually follow throughMy husband and I came to Columbia Fertility after having a terrible experience with another fertility doctor in Manhattan who made me feel old and defective Once, when she was done with a procedure with a different patient, she quickly came to see me to personally review my ultrasound and speak to me She is just a wonderfully compassionate and warm personWe had a wonderful experience here, primarily because of dr Brady From the very beginning till the end, she was very knowledgeable, attentive and considerate, and she was always easy to talk to and responded to our questions both in person and via emailThe Columbia Fertility Center has been amazing! I started seeing them less than a year ago for IVF and they have been very helpful every step of the way I was specifically a patient of Dr Forman and his bedside manner is exceptional In addition he makes it very clear that he cares about your overall health During the monitoring phases of IVF you may not always see your doctor but that never made me feel uncomfortable because they were all warm and supportive of your concernsMy husband and I had the good fortune of being connected to Dr Forman during our journey through conception From the day we met with Dr Eric Forman it was all positive and promising We have never met with a more attentive, caring, compassionate and empathic doctor and facility We are blessed to be associated with them and Dr Forman Instead, they have given us more than promised at every appointment with respect to their time and answers to every question that we had I felt like I was in great hands throughout my entire experienceDr McConnell was amazing She was extremely patient with me, answering (in detail) any and numerous questions that crossed my mindMy husband and I are extremely joyful that we had the experience to work with Dr McConnell, as our fertility specialistDr Forman and the team at Columbia are among the very best out there Dr Forman is the most responsive, accessible doctor I have ever worked with: he always answered emails within the day, sometimes within minutes, and he was willing to have lengthy phone conversations with me to go over any and every question I had Dr Forman always treated me as an individual, as he adjusted my protocols over the course of treatment to get better and better outcomes While he seems a bit quiet and not super warm/fuzzy at first, he clearly cares about his patients--who else calls the evening before a retrieval to check if you have any last questions and wish you luck??--and goes above and beyond to help Can't recommend Dr Forman highly enoughI cannot say enough good things about my experience with Dr Forman and the team at Columbia's fertility center He was professional and informative but also explained everything in language that we could understand He was positive and reassuring and was ALWAYS available to answer any and all questions I felt bad emailing him on the weekends because I knew that he would answer within hours and I did not want to take him away from his family Dr Forman checked in with the office and emailed me while on his vacation to tell me that my blood test results were positive and that the IVF round was successful This communication is above and beyond and the whole team at Columbia never made me feel like there was a silly or stupid question I continued my pregnancy with Columbia doctors and continued to have a great experienceDr Rachel McConnell is an outstanding physician She gives you hope and leaves you feeling confident in her capable and caring hands We are forever grateful for their help in growing our family!We came to Columbia after reading the positive reviews on Fertility IQ, particularly for Dr Forman Dr Forman is caring and highly communicative (no other doctor has ever emailed me to keep me informed at each stage), and really takes all the delicate factors (labs, insurance, age, etc Infertility is physically and emotionally draining, but my husband and I have been able to relax somewhat knowing that they have everything under control here I had a wonderful experience at Columbia Fertility from consultation to conception As a high risk patient, I was very nervous about finding the right doctor who understood my condition and I had the extremely good fortune of being connected with Dr Brady who could not have been more caring and thorough She is *extremely* knowledgeable, answered all of my questions, and has a very comforting bedside manner which is so important Me and my husband both felt confident that we were in the best hands possible From the very first step of receiving information to the end of my process, Dr Brady along with her team, Sherry and Varda, truly made me feel very comfortable and made the journey much easierI am extremely happy with this center  The staff are always courteous and Dr Paula Brady is amazing  She has an excellent bedside manner and takes time to explain everything with her patients  I went for a routine visit and had a general question and she went through the history of my chart to respond in a way that was suited for my individual program  She really seems to care about her patients and makes sure to go beyond to make sure you are comfortable throughout the entire process After leaving this agency, I went to New Hope Fertility Center and I'm finally pregnant I don't need any stress in my life during this pregnancyI went to this office for the first time mainly due to seeing Jen the pheblemist in the elevatorJessica and Edelith was very polite and sensitive towards me knowing the reason why I am coming to see the doctorI've been a patient here for about a year and can't say enough good thingsI would like to recommend Dr Rogerio Lobo as he is one of the most polite and patient doctor that I have come across He is also very knowledgeable and would not simply just recommend any invasive procedures Thank you Dr Lobo!Dr Forman listened to my concerns and is very good with first time IVF patients He consistently went above and beyond for me the entire time I was in his care I actually teared up when I saw himHe and his team understood that these things mattered and what a difference it makes when your concerns are taken seriouslyI can't recommend Columbia University Fertility Center enoughDr Williams is the most amazing Dr He is kind, caring and compassionate I would highly recommend him and his practiceEverybody is very kind and caringHe takes his time getting to know you and your needsWe have partnered with Dr Rachel McConnell and so beyond happy with her After less than a yr with her we are finally pregnant and graduated from the facility It was bittersweet and felt strange as we have bonded and felt at home with everyone I never felt like just the ""next"" patient but truly like they cared I could go on and on but honestly Dr McConnell was simply the best and so knowledgeable especially with any ideas I brought to her attentionI live in New Hampshire and feel so incredibly grateful to have been referred to the Columbia University Fertility Center and Dr Williams They were caring, kind, brilliant, and progressive Dr Williams made himself available to me during all hours of the day and expressed the most sincere, intent care I rarely find a doctor who I feel is just as invested in my case as I am, and Dr Williams and the group exceeded all of my expectations The doctors suck - they don't give a shit and never return your callsMy husband and I had been trying to conceive for about a little over 2 years Unsure of where to begin or how to start this daunting process, we decided to meet with a Dr at Columbia and essentially took a leap of faith I ended up doing two (failed) cycles of IUI last year with the Doctor we had first met with at Columbia After more research, we decided to switch to Dr Eric Forman for our first (and successful!!) IVF cycle and SO happy we did He was truly understanding and personable, had amazing communication and response time - no question too inconsequential or too complicated to re-explain and is SUPER informative I could not recommend Dr Forman enough!Saw Dr Forman a few weeks back and very happy with my experience I previously saw another Dr in Brooklyn, but my experience at Columbia Fertility Clinic was like night and day Dr Forman was very thorough and had a great bedside mannerOur whole experience in the center was wonderful! Dr Forman was so fantastic! Dr Forman assisted us through every step of this scary and exciting process He is kind, detailed and always available She really taker her time to make you feel safe and taken care of I can't say enough wonderful things of this entire practice! I am so happy we chose Columbia University Fertility! We are so blessed that all went perfectly and we are expecting a baby, May 1st! THANK YOU to the fantastic team or caring professionals! Dr McConnell is brilliant and also kind and comforting throughout what can be a very anxiety-producing process She is patient with me and answers all of my questions, and I never feel rushed Dr Forman was so supportive, responsive, caring, and knowledgeable! He was there for us every step of the way and took the time to explain the process He truly wants to be there for his patients and always answered my questions over email without delay! I was blown away by the amazing level of care - especially after my husband and I had a negative experience with another fertility clinicLet me start off by saying that I'm writing this as my 5 week old son is napping in the other room After seeing many fertility specialists on Long Island and in the city we found Dr Eric Forman We were only given a 20% chance of successfully conceiving Dr Forman was compassionate, informative, and supportive He explained highly complex and technical procedures in plain english I can not recommend Dr Forman and the entire team - doctors, nurses, techs, etc - highly enough","Over the course of two years there were many who I interacted with and I would call out their names but I don't want to leave anyone out! It was a happy day to graduate and be released to my ob gyn with hugs and high fives from the staff and Dr Forman! . The staff are always courteous and Dr Paula Brady is amazing . She has an excellent bedside manner and takes time to explain everything with her patients .

1,Columbia University Fertility,advice," She would even reply emails on Sundays She considers her patients as humans, understands them and design the program accordingly for each patient individually based on the specific requirements of the patients She prepares a road map for a patient and follow it up till the end, which I really liked about her There is nothing ambiguous about her plan, she makes everything simple and clearIf anyone is considering a fertility program, I would sincerely advise to consult Columbia Fertility and look for Dr Brady as she is the best resource And one last advice, when you become her patient, trust on her judgement and her team and believe me "" It will get better"" We didn't know what to expect when we first decided to go to the fertility center This was probably the most non-overwhelming doctor experience I have ever had Dr Karipcin was amazing and we were lucky to have her  She answered all my questions and concerns No question is dumb or too small for himDoctor was all talk no action Dr Karipcin was our doctor and she was amazing We were so lucky to have worked with her She will always be a part of our family Thank you doctor!

3,Columbia University Fertility,clinic,"Columbia University Fertility center is an excellent fertility clinic as they have wonderful team of doctorsThe Clinic as a whole is also very good as it is open to patients on holidays, weekends, and even the new year holiday Even when you call them at a very short notice, they get back to you quite quicklyGod has deputed some angels in the form of humans and she is one of those angels working to help distressed people at a very personal levelWhile going through all this, you don't only need medications but you also need support and kind words from your medical team as well These words may seem pretty simple in normal English but believe me, coming from your physician when you are in distress works wonder and Dr Brady is great in communicating them in such a way that these lines would act as healer for meThe atmosphere at Columbia Fertility Center is warm and welcoming Its the nicest atmosphere I have ever experienced in a doctor's office First of all the whole place had a positive and light energy No stress no confusion But honestly it all went so smooth and hustle free We were always updated the same day after our appointmentI had a great experience with Columbia Fertility  doctors and staff over a couple of years  The staff was so friendly they felt like extended family while going through the ups and downs that can occur with fertility woes  All who I interacted with were attentive and responsive- from the front desk staff, nursing staff, back office staff and the doctorsWe had a wonderful experience at Columbia University Fertility Center The office space is bright and clean, the employees are constantly smiling, no matter what time of day it is, and the communication process cannot be beat He gets how stressful of a process this is for you and truly does everything he can to make you feel as comfortable and well informed as possible A few specific logistical perks of Columbia are that they make morning monitoring appointments for you (as opposed to first come, first served, walk-in time frames which is how a lot of other places do it) Additionally, procedures are done on-site in the back surgical room (as opposed to going to the corresponding hospital which is also how other places seem to do it) Finally, instead of taking an injection class, we were able to sit down one-on-one with a nurse to go over the process These are little things, but make a huge difference throughout the experience Columbia really has thought about all of the intricacies and has done a great job making it as streamlined as possible for patients They make you feel welcome, they are fast, and they communicate well Of course there were bad days, hormonal days, sad days, but through it all my care team was supportive! The nurses smile at you and they try to all learn your name  No thanks for this place When we arrived at Columbia Fertility, we were impressed with the facility It was welcoming, bright, and new, everything you want from a clinic The receptionists were all nice and pleasant The wait for appointments and morning monitoring was never long The nurses and technicians became like friends They were supportive and friendly, at a time when you really need to see a smile She is a smart, competent, and dedicated professional  A lot of women use this center for their fertility and it's incredible how the office is able to manage it I have never sat in the waiting room for a long time, even when it is busy They are great!

IVF is such a stressful experience, and you want to work with experts who will make it as manageable as possible Being a teacher, the monitoring hours worked for me and they were able to accommodate me by giving me one of the first appointments There were some days that I waited longer than usual to be seen but it did not happen often While there are many women that go through their offices every day, every doctor and nurse cares about the individual patient Over the course of my journey, I got to know the staff so well that I felt sad leaving to my regular obgyn I have recommended Columbia fertility to many people and we are eternally grateful for everything they have done for us We have our family thanks to her!!

7,New Hope Fertility Center,doctor,"After 7 years of going to my OBGYN feeling broken and helpless, being diagnosed with PCOS doing the timed intercourse, being given Clomid and Metformin, using OPKs, getting an HSG and being told that it would happen if I gave it time saying they could not physically ever find anything wrong with me I was finally referred to New Hope Fertility center The most impressive thing was how thorough they were It never took over 45 minutes for me to be seen They sat down with me and my husband and spoke to us about what we've done and what we should do Needless to say I felt safe Thanks to the lovely Dr Liu, who took the time to create a personalised stims and implantation plan according to my previous medical history and body cycle He was always kind, patient and positive, calling me each time he changed the medicine dosage to explain why or when the process did not go according to plan We used a surrogate and Tiffany, like Dr Liu, was a sincere cheerleader I felt taken care of, unlike with other practitioners who saw me with a dollar sign in their eyes and that I was just another battery farm hen I am so grateful to Dr Liu and his team for giving me the best gift of motherhoodAll I can tell any woman who is seeking the finest fertility care in NYC to only go here Every nurse, my wonderful and amazing Dr, Dr Makarov, make you feel that becoming a parent is not only possible but can be done treating your body in the best care possible They understand how fragile and delicate this process is and take extreme care of you from beginning to end They go out of their way to make sure you are clear on things and leave no room for doubt, question or confusion I read some of the reviews of others who gave them a 1 Star review and I'm like how?! Why?! Nothing is perfect, but New Hope is perfect for meI went to NHFC because after doing some research on doctors in Manhattan, I decided to go with Dr Jennifer MakarovBut I am giving 5 stars because the most important thing here is getting pregnant, and they helped me have a baby I was seen by Dr Merhi and would not recommend him  Answering patient phone calls They do not care I am not only an employee for the last 6 years but also a patient at New Hope Fertility and I wanted to share my story Yesterday I gave birth to my miracle baby Just early this year me and my husband were discussing adoption or fostering a child/baby I was just so tired of the constant disappointment and the multiple losses I had suffered in the last 10 years My husband convinced me to try one last time after we sat in a hot tub with a few drinks in our system during a trip to Dominican Republic in May 2019 I just laughed and I said okay just one last time hun after this we have to move forward with other options even if it meant I would never carry our own child Just want to thank Dr Liu from new hope fertility who has helped me through this ivf process the last two years He is amazing, patient, supportive, compassionate and took such great care of me We are extremely grateful he has helped bless us with a blessing we thought was never possible When I first met with the doctor she was nice, but talked to me for 5 minutes before doing the ultrasound When she did the ultrasound she said ""looks like you may have some endometriosis"" That was the end of that conversation Finally, when my husband went up and spoke to someone after 2 hours we were taken in to see the doctor about the genetic results When I went into the testing room, I told the doctor I was scared because I heard this may hurt Then suddenly, they let me know that they actually would be able to start fertility treatments the following day have to do it yourself, but since I wasn't getting the treatment yet I hadn't enrolled so I would of had to pay out of pocket for this but lastly, she had just told me I might have had endometriosis and they weren't even going to look into that? Needless to say, I left there hysterically crying and never went back They made an already vulnerable situation way worse The doctor sat with us for 45 minutes to go over our history in detail and now I'm waiting to get help for my endometriosis which they think is the problem before we start fertility treatmentsI met with Dr Jackman a couple of weeks ago for an initial consultation We haven't even gone through initial fertility testing to see if that is even necessary  I came in with very low expectations for customer service, doctor ""bedside manner"" and the like, HOWEVER, I was very much blown away by how I was treated  I had my consultation with Dr Olcha who very clearly drew out diagrams on his ipad and explained EVERYTHING to me and my partner  My emails are promptly responded to and when I email Dr Olcha, he emails me back, right away!  I get a faster response from Dr Olcha than some of my work colleagues, lolz Doctor Zhang is very attentive and passionate about what he does, he is hopeful and realistic at the same time And now I am going back to Dr Merhi for #2 Wish me luck! I am writing​ this review because I would like to express my appreciation​ to Dr Merhi He is kind, compassionate, having a ​positive​ vibe and very professional at​​ the same time​​ Long story short, when I had a problem with NHFC, Dr Merhi called me to make sure if everything was ok For example, during the procedure, I did not get enough information​ so I needed to google every day​ to understand things Overall, I definitely​ recommend​ NHFC especially​ they have wonderful​ doctors such as​ Dr MerhiUpdate:I used to recommend this place to everyone but they are really struggling to keep up Dr Zhang is really good at what he does I've had to tell them that certain things don't work with the protocol they've given me They don't care If they make a mistake, they will still treat you like the jerkIf you're trying to get pregnant you're familiar with the things you need to look into: the health of your uterus, your fallopian tubes, and your hormone distribution Here I am 11 months later I'm finally pregnant, see my baby, and hear his heartbeat via ultrasound I can not thank them all enough for the many blessings we have and are going to receiveI gave 2 two stars because of I got pregnant I feel like they treat patient like number They don't care patientsThey are explaining is never enough what's going on and what's the planDr Merhi is wonderful  I would recommend him to absolutely ANYONE looking to get pregnant  I can't believe the negative reviews for NH because my experience has only been positive  All in all, I recommend the practice and especially Dr Merhi! Many times, i have had to call, email three/frour times just to confirm that they received my test results and what my next steps were going to beYou will pay in your time, how frustrated their process and their way of conducting business will make you feelI made appointment at 12pm, finally my name got called at 1:15pm And I am still waiting after I said I would like to talk to the doc firstDr Merhi, is a very skilled, knowledgable and attentive doctor He listens to the patient and is not interested in personal results and stats but is genuinely interested in the well being of his patient He has excellent bed side manners I plan on returning to Dr Merhi for my second child They could be more compassionate and treat you less like a number Especially, Dr Merhi's care was consistently kind, focused, informed, and of the highest medical caliber and indicative of extensive, specialized training and knowledge I am highly impressed with this clinic and unequivocally recommend NHFC and particularly, Dr Merhi who did not want to disclose her last name for obvious reasons was extremely rude, unprofessional and argumentative with me I called the office to speak with Dr Zhang so that he may explain results that I had receivedI just wanna say thank you  to NHFC I've never been pregnant in my life I'm 31 years old until now and I've tried! I'm currently 2 1/2 months pregnant  & I still can't believe this! Yes like every establishment they have there flaws but the clinic itself was worth every penny I spent!! They were very attentive to what I wanted to do! I made sure I stayed on top of them because this is something I really wanted the same way when it comes to wanting a job!! The place is clean, they provide snacks for you while you wait! I highly recommend this place if your having issues getting pregnant! It's not a easy process but the reward at the end is well worth the fight! Thank you Dr Merhi  I came here over a year ago as recommended by my OB-gyn  I was incredibly put off  After speaking to the doctor - who appeared to have not even looked at my chart- missing vital info like I was on a medication dangerous for trying to conceive- I was told to come in over and over for monitoring  I did this a few times- never understanding what I was doing or receiving any follow up  I finally burned out on the awful feeling of not even being a human or having a name to these people and I stopped going  Yes we had success and recently delivered a beautiful healthy baby girl, but I felt the whole process was smooth and very attentive  I appreciated the monitoring once we found out we were pregnant to make sure things were progressing as they shouldAfter we decided to stop treatment due to a number of failed attempts, we explained that we were going to stop with the doctor involved We responded that we had informed them we had decided to stop treatment and voiced our issues with the fact that they never seemed to check their records, or simply failed to record it We replied that we were asking to be acknowledged in some way and treated like individuals but received no further response Considering how much they must make, I think this shows a real lack of care in their patients The doctors are not knowledgeable and I had many failed cycles because they use inappropriate protocols and even cannot do the trigger timing correctly I have seen many patients with messed up cycles because of doctors' mistakes  And the literature clearly stating that if time is delay and it can negatively impact pregnancy outcome  I highly not recommend this place(I post this on behalf of my friend who wants to remain anonymous) My husband and I planned to have kids right after we got married, but with no success after 3-5 years of trying  Along the way 10+ precious years passedAt the time of hopelessness, we came across New Hope and Dr Zhang The first thing Dr Zhang told us was that ""there is no problem with you, tests are all good, all you need to do is to nourish your body and get ready""  ""I'm confident you will get pregnant within 6-12 months"" I continued physical exercises, jogging, keeping fit and losing weight, for half a year Hey, we made it after all these years of pain and desperation, and we are really proud of ourselves and our 2 kids!In a nutshell, we are very grateful to Dr Zhang who made our dream come true, and to his conviction of combining Western technology with Chinese cultivation/nourishment methodologyI have to update my initial review I don't know if they've gotten busier or if my pregnancy last time was just a matter of fate Now that my cycle failed nurses advised that I meet with Dr Zhang for my next steps I feel like the nurses really handled my care this time without consulting with doctors The doctor does not follow your case the nurses are the one sending email saying what the doctor is saying I feel they don't know what they are doing You are just a number your care is not customize for you I was left on the exam table waiting for a doctor to explain to me why a year later i have no follicles In an entire year i saw the doctor 4 times I ended up seeing Dr Olcha who was great and held my hand through the whole process! I am persistently calling to speak with someone about my embryos and I have been calling for days  Not a single person has called back In spite of repeated calls and pleading that someone call me back about some time sensitive issues and questions its been silence from NHFCNo one calls you back no matter WHERE you are in your journey/treatment No one does what they say they are going to do (ie call you back, process insurance, call the pharmacy)The doctor is there SOMETIMES This process is all about timing and they make an already trying process needlessly more excruciating, frustrating, and expensiveMost disappointing of all, is they sell you on ""Hope"" when realistically the stats and numbers they come to slowly reveal are a little less hopeful and more realisticDr Merhi was lovely  In our  4th cycle experience we had to restart our cycle 2 times Let me explain  We finally got to speak to our doctor The end result They will not explain anything to you, respond to your inquiries, and zero personal attention  I was recommended for treatments using donor eggs at the first consultation at a clinic in NJ before my treatment wasn't even started because I was 43  Also, the clinic in NJ made me feel pressured to use donor eggs and uncomfortable to continue treatments there due to my age  What I liked about NHFC is NHFC doctors listen to you and work with patients together  With great thanks to Dr Zhang, Dr Lui, Joanna (nurse) and Chisa (embryologist) who supported us thru this difficulty journey, our life changed with this miracle baby o(^-^)o  Especially if you are older like me and don't get many eggs thru conventional IVFs, I highly recommend NHFCDr Merhi at the New Hope Fertility Center was referred to me for fertility treatment He is very attentive to his patients, caring, comforting, personable and has a great sense of humor Dr Merhi was amazing through it all! He was extremely attentive, patient and strategic in helping us overcome any hurdles that we encountered I can't emphasize enough how much they are patient-centered and have great bedside manners, which was very important to me My husband and I couldn't be happier, because Dr Merhi really took his time with ensuring we had as high of a success rate as possible I am sad about not visiting New Hope since I have graduated from their care, but I feel I left with all the knowledge I need to help me through this next phase of my pregnancy You aren't allowed to speak to your doctor, you aren't seen by the main doctor or regularly by anyone who gets to know you As a number, they don't care about whether you live or die or if you suffer- they only care about numbers and money Shame, shame, shame on you Dr Zhang Well, i didn't listen Dr and now i have a beautiful daughterI am Dr Merhi's patient (AMAZING) almost done with my cycle and due to external circumstances I need to stop and travel home to Texas to see my family She helped me figure out my situation in terms of my next cycle and financially within 10 minutes I could not believe how involved she became and how quickly she took action Whatever the case, thank you to everyone who works there My experience has been incredible despite the circumstances and will be back in Dr Merhi's office as soon as I return All the protocols are personalized and Dr Yang follows through with his patients from the beginning to the end Try to find a few IVF partners at the wait roomDr Zaher Merhi was great and he always answered my questions in a timely mannerI am currently 10 weeks pregnant with Twins and couldn't be more happier !Thank you Dr Merhi and the New Hope staff! I called them, a reception takes down your number, but i get no call back Thank you for completely changing our lives, Dr Makarov! I had visited many fertility doctors and most of them told me I'd need to use donor egg given my age and egg quality In the end, I gave up and went to another service provider Dr Merhi is a very sympathetic and knowledgable doctor who helped us out in just a few quick visits I worked with Drs That went a long way with me in terms of dealing with the emotional disappointment I had to go in one or twice because phone calls/emails weren't being responded to I almost gave up but Dr Zaher Merhi gave me encouragement and prayer that gave me the strength to press on and I'm truly grateful! It's frustrating talking to them trying to explain stuff about your scheduleI was Dr Yang's patient, everything went great with him, he's the only doctor who gave me confident and hope so far New Hope Fertility center haven't given me any notification who will follow my case, and who will give me further instructions  No one ever sat down with me and went over a schedule  None of the information I needed to have a successful cycle was provided  There were failures at EVERY step of my cycle  All of this excludes the points that can be made about false promises, unethical processes, undue stressI'm sure many women are hesitant to speak on this experience as it is a personal, private, medical process  Some interest in the women's experience and needs in this process is essential Highly recommend using NHFC if you are thinking of having children or are having difficulties We contacted New Hope in the hope of getting more information about if they could do anything about our case My initial conference with Dr Zhang was very pleasant The retrieval was not anxiety producing and I didn't feel rushed If I end up using the frozen eggs, I'll go back to NHFC for the rest of the treatment Dr Zhang on first impressions was kind, honest, enthusiastic, very knowledgeable and put us on a less aggressive program than what we had been on My wife is Japanese and I would say the approach and environment does lend itself to an Asian feel, so she felt more comfortable in that respect too Of the negatives that some people might have, it doesn't give you the most personal of touch and sometimes seems to be mechanical in its operation, but this was never an issue for us personally for example you spoke to different nurses and doctors along the way, rather than having one dedicated to you  He told me I needed to do IVF right away because statistically my fertility was falling off a cliff although I explained that my husband and I had only been trying to conceive for just over 3 months and I'd gotten naturally pregnant and had a miscarriage in that time Go somewhere else if you want to be treated like a person I would 100% refer Dr Merhi and the staff at New Hope to anyone struggling with infertility Dr Zhang gave realistic success rate analyzation, unlike other clinics would try to sell you a dream And Dr Liu who did some of my retrievals and transfer is simply amazing and very pleasant to work with It is a very serious matter to fail an FDA inspection and I would caution you before moving forward with their egg donor program to have all the facts straight from the FDA You will never see Dr Zhang again after your first initial appointmentEveryone's experience is deeply personal when it comes to fertility I can only speak for myself when I say that this place was amazing and Dr Merhi is a blessing Dr Merhi is literally the most pleasant person alive--- he answered all of my questions immediately and as a result, I recommended him to all of my friends These types of accommodations make me feel like they care about my success :))))I have been with New Hope since September 2016 and my husband and I are thrilled to find out the good news with just 1 cycle via the ""Mini-IVF"" plan If you are planning IVF, I highly recommend New Hope Facility!Our baby boy arrived a few days ago! We went through two cycles with NHFC and was successful on the second try New Hope has been amazing, all thanks to Dr Zhang and his wonderful team Excuse my ignorance, but I thought that everything is time sensitive, at least that's how they make it feel like, so if my appt for a procedure is at 11 am and I don't get into the room until 2 hours later, Is this normal? One time were sitting in the waiting room for so long that even the receptionist came up to us to ask what are we waiting forThe reason I chose this place is because of Dr Zhang But unfortunately I have not seen or heard from the man since my first consultation For now, I m still hopeful and giving them a chance but to be honest I have started looking into other places just to have my options in the futureThe only Issue I had with NHfC was getting accounting to respond to me  However, I saw 3 doctors while I was having IVF Dr Luk and Dr Zhang were always in a hurry to get out of the examining room, and were never forthcoming with information We never felt like a priority to them There was never any follow up after a procedure from the doctors, not even an email After the IVF failed, Dr Zhang didn't call, not even to encourage me to do a 2nd roundIf you do decide to try New Hope, the only doctor I would recommend is Dr Chang He saw us a couple times when our regular doctor couldn't and he was what every patient hopes her doctor will be: professional, forthcoming with knowledge, patient and kind He explained everything I was going through in great detail and was always available via email to answer any questions that I had He has great bedside manner and is very knowledgeable I highly recommend New Hope!Dr Merhi is one of the most caring doctors that I have ever worked withDr Zhang's approach is very different from the rest of the reproductive endocrinologists And it can be very busy in there at times I will be forever grateful that I found them  And now I have a 3 year old daughter because of new hope We had a long consultation with Dr Zhang He told us that we had a 5-10% chance of getting pregnant and then if we did get pregnant, there would be a 45% chance of miscarriage We could not believe it! We had beaten the odds Dr Zhang initially presented to us! The following weeks were stressful, but my numbers were all good The US tech was unfortunately not too encouraging but the following week, we had a wonderful tech that told us not to lose hope just yet I can't say enough about the care I received at New Hope  I went to New Hope at age 42 after 2 failed IVF attempts that resulted in a miscarriage  Dr Zhang and his staff are exceptional  Dr Zhang tailored my treatment and helped me understand that I didn't need a lot of injections and all you need is one golden egg, which I got and he's sleeping peacefully in his crib The first opinion from other clinic wanted me to have an invasive surgery, but Dr Yang suggested not to and gave me a different conception plan instead After a month with NHFC, i got pregnant and now have a beautiful daughter I would NOT recommend this establishment to absolutely anyone (person, dog, cat or rat!!) MAY I ADD ONCE MORE!! I saw Dr Zhang for an initial  consultation on August 25th, both prior and during this appointment their office confirmed that they accepted my insurance and listed New Hope as a participating provider on my paperwork No one bothered to mention that they would no longer be a participating provider as of September 1st - 7 days later! It is entirely inconceivable that they didn't know this during my consultation Moreover, not only did no one in the office bother to mention this upcoming insurance change during my initial consultation, but they never did, despite my arriving and checking-in for three following appointments I felt like we were given a personalized program versus just being treated like a number (like at other clinics) Everyone we dealt with was very caring I would highly recommend New Hope Even when trying to be friendly, I only received terse answers and little kindness In what is obviously a sensitive and emotional point in your life, you ought to be treated with care and compassion I never felt that here From Dr Zhang especially, there was only routine and coldness After four months with New Hope, my husband and I were trying to decide on next steps and understand what might be going on I'm sure he's a busy man, but we were paying him for our care, and he was cold and inconsiderate As we stood trying to get answers to our questions, he opened the door and left the room If you want compassionate, good care, do not go to New HopeI had a great great experience with dr Zhang and all the staff Bottom line is that I have been trying to get pregnant for many years before I came to New Hope and I got pregnant and had a healthy baby boy thanks to New Hope Zhang and Yang, and, of course, the wonderful staff at New Hope Fertility  Dr Zhang is no-nonsense  He is not going to sit there and commiserate with you about past failures  What he is going to do is:  1) be honest about your overall situation  Compare Dr Zhang's results to other clinics -- quite impressiveMy husband and I were 40 when we got married and we tried having children right awayI personally think the clinic and the doctors worked very accurately based on a very customized procedure, they check on you, it seems, very specifically according to your hormone status and situation at that very day and moment I had tried 3 other times previously in another country and didn't get pregnant I stayed with this clinic beacuse when I met Dr Zhang he honestly suggested me to do NOTHING, to NOT do any ivf or tentative because of my age! this is a very rare answer in these kind of clinics, since they want to make money out of tentatives, while in this case I found pure straightforward honesty You have to know my husband and I ar both fertile, I mean no problem of fertility, but my husband had vasectomy so the sperm had to be extracted from the testicle (it is done at the uologist they refer, not at the clinic, who, by the way, was an awesome doctor) Thak you Dr Zang andto th all stuffThe doctor did a great job of explaining how/why egg freezing works (he was extremely knowledgeable and polite), but when it came down to the actual procedure and process, I felt a little lost here  However, it took us about 3 years trying for the second one with no success  We almost gave up hope but our friend who also had success with the IVF at New Hope recommended this place to us  I had all previous test results from other fertility clinic which showed my infertility is unexplained  We first met with Dr Zhang who spent a lot of time slowing explaining to us  From my personal experience, I can tell that Dr Zhang doesn't try to push as many IVF procedures on patients as possible as claimed by others who commented earlier but rather recommends what he thinks is best for the patient given her current condition, iI had two successful transfers done with Dr Zhangand if you don't like what they tell you  they wouldn't even allow you to speak with your doctor meaning you think you're a client of Dr Zhang but you're not if you have a question or a problemTerrible Place!! Do NOT go there!!I went to New Hope Fertility for over 6 months and was not been tested for any procedural infertility testing, such as X-Ray examination for normal uterine cavity and Fallopian tubes patencyI feel like I wasted very valuable timeI saw Dr Zaher Merhi at New Hope and I just had a beautiful baby boy Dr Merhi is the most incredible, kind and supportive doctor around He has a wonderful sense of humor and really knows how to put patients at ease Infertility is such a challenging journey and Dr Merhi was with us every step of the way, explaining every medication and procedure with such patience I can not thank him enough for giving us the most meaningful gift in the whole world  When we went back two days later, they ran another test and told my wife, the egg is gone The other doctors wanted me to go for donor egg and didn't want to try any treatment but Dr Zhang had confidence that I could get pregnant with my own eggs Dr Zhang and his team were great and I had a wonderful experience at New Hope He is a very patient doctor and customizes the treatment as per his patient's situation I had chucked it all to ""that's life"" but to add insult to injury almost 7 years after I last saw Dr Zhang and demanded a refund (which they gave me) I get a bill in the mail (first time I'd heard from them in all those years) charging me for storage of a bio sample that I never knew they'd keptMy husband and I have tried for many years to conceived We had gone to several centers and were extremely disappointed From that moment Dr Merhi spent quality time on my case  Dr Merhi answered all our questions and spent endless time without rushing us  No other doctor took the time to do this; Dr Merhi listened when I voiced my concerns of the medications were affecting my body  Anyone who has gone through fertility treatments knows that it is a stressful and emotional process  After years of trying at other facilities that treated us as just another experiment, we conceived More than anything, we are thrilled to have achieved a healthy pregnancy and to have welcomed a beautiful baby girl! I recommend them without hesitation In my case, I had tried 4 cycles of conventional IVF in another renown place (RMA), with no success This sounds like a small issue, but when you are in taking hormones and the level of anxiety is high, a nice word or a nice gesture makes a whole difference  Third, in my case at least, I fell like Dr Zhang's more natural approach to the hormones intake end up fitting  more my body Just to finish my story, Dr Zhang was very honest with us, he told me that the chances even through IVF was 5 -10 % for my ageWe saw Dr Zhang as our primary doctor Contrary to Dr Zhang, I did not need IVF to have a baby It's not very reassuring, and after spending almost 10k with no feedback, (clearly if IUI isn't working after 3xs and getting no feedback and oddball hormone levels, there's some serious situations falling through the cracks) I don't think I will return here I'm a pretty independent, low maintenance, easy going person, and even I feel that there could be alot more individualized attention to patients aside from a ""patient liason"" I observe wandering around sometimes You'll be escorted throughout the office to have an ultrasound, blood work, meet with the doctor, who will recommend mini-IVF and PGD It feels rushed But you are wiling to do whatever it takes You will be comforted by that You will wonder how you will be treated when you are actually fully under their care & have clinical questions or concernsI am not sure where my initial review went, however almost a year later I am still unable to officially take care of my billing issues She had an attitude with me, but promised to adjust my account and send me an email with all the corrected information We met with Dr Zhang once and then were ""handled"" by many members of young staff in their 20s with an attitudeUnfortunately, all the negative reviews are correct  We had a ""consultation"" appointment where Dr Zhang took about an hour of our time to try to up sell us an IVF  I felt like I was in one of those terrible lectures where they try to sell you time share!  Dr Zhang said we would do a sonogram and a blood test and he would call me with a ""plan"" when the blood work came back  She is a nurse and Dr Zhang is a doctor  Since when did Doctor's and Nurses stop taking blood?  With this, Dr Zhang called me the next day with his ""plan"", which was to try 1 IUI, then go straight to IVF  When I asked to speak to Dr Zhang, they told me I would need to make a phone consultation appointment, which of course, costs $150  My husband and I had been to three other REs and we were on the verge of giving upI had a very positive experience at New Hope Fertility Center that culminated in a successful and healthy pregnancy Don't get deceived by reviews that Dr Zheng is a money driven practitioner  Dr Zheng will offer you adjustments and options based on your results and attitude, unlike other places With his experience and knowledge, he is wiling to risk and takes patients that no-one else considers treatable, regardless of how it will affects his ""success"" statistics Throughout the process, I didn't feel any discomfort Finally, I went to consult with Dr Zhang at New Hope Fertility Center Thank you New Hope Staff and Dr Zhang!It took me a while to register on Yelp and write this review, as I want other women reading it to really give Dr Zhang a chance I also waited for my baby girl to turn 2 months!!! We were successful with New Hope at the 1st try and Dr Zhang was the first doctor to tell me that I am young enough and will have children, he really gave me hope I was 36 when I got pregnantWhere can I start after 15 years of infertility, new hope was able to give me a blessing, they was patient and kind, caring and professional , I would always wear glitter and they even gave me nickname tinkerbell Perhaps those in charge have become more concerned about their image after receiving some negative reviews, but I am mystified by those negative reviews here One negative reviewer mentioned Dr Zhang's mentor at NYU I moved to Dr Zhang who is far more consultative and tailored in his approach to each patient) Do Zhang's efforts to develop his own shop negate his far better bedside manner, willingness to listen to patients' preferences & their educated pushback on his recommendations, as well as his (and his team's) far more flexible, bespoke treatment of patients, compared to other shops? No way They miss the details that would optimize timing and tweaking during each step of the cycle Patients have experienced Dr Noyes behaving like an absolute MONSTER   New Hope also treats some of the toughest (oldest) cases In this respect, perhaps they're giving people False Hope instead of New Hope  But there were many misconceptions in the previous reviews  I only needed to wait 15 minutes before I went in to consult with Dr Zhang  Dr Zhang was hopeful that he would be able to help me conceive possibly without additional hormones, which is called a Natural IVF cycleI've been undergoing fertility treatments for over two years  Bottom line - Dr Zhang is a money hungry doctor  I met with his mentor at NYU who told me, ""Let's just say he is a business man""  This mentor has had many debates with Dr Zhang about some of his philosophies reminding him that many of them have zero medical evidenceand actually, the medical evidence points in the opposite direction of what Dr Zhang proposesI even wrote to Dr Zhang complaining about the ridiculous wait times and disorganization of the office  It got the point where I told the office that I don't ever want to speak with him again and will only communicate with Dr Luk, who actually is amazing  What I have found is fertility doctors are trained to do this: figure out why you are not able to get pregnant, pump you with meds and try to get you to do an IUI or IVF until you finally say ""no more  They don't care about about you as a personthey wee trained to know your eggs, ovaries and partner's sperm count  Dr Zhang was the worst because he did not care to ever have a conversation  No kidding - after my last IVF failed, the nurses (not Dr Zhang) called to say, ""Come on in when your cycle starts so we can schedule your next IVFI believe the overall methodology that NH has embarked on is top notch and found Dr Zhang to be very knowledgeable for insemination like they wanted, I came on day 11 and went from there  Here, the doctor is hardly ever available albeit knowledgeable last week i asked to see or speak to Dr Zhang (who was already my doctor by the way) and Human Resources said it would take ONE MONTH and this is after they had messed up with my cycle (which took over 5 phone calls and several emails and finally i got a call back from the doctor admitting to mistakes being made earlier this month) i went there for the embryology dept and under the false promises of Dr Zhang that he would pay attention to my case for the cycle","Nothing is perfect, but New Hope is perfect for meI went to NHFC because after doing some research on doctors in Manhattan, I decided to go with Dr Jennifer MakarovBut I am giving 5 stars because the most important thing here is getting pregnant, and they helped me have a baby I was seen by Dr Merhi and would not recommend him . I came in with very low expectations for customer service, doctor bedside manner and the like, HOWEVER, I was very much blown away by how I was treated . My emails are promptly responded to and when I email Dr Olcha, he emails me back, right away! . I can't believe the negative reviews for NH because my experience has only been positive . All in all, I recommend the practice and especially Dr Merhi! Yes like every establishment they have there flaws but the clinic itself was worth every penny I spent!! They were very attentive to what I wanted to do! I made sure I stayed on top of them because this is something I really wanted the same way when it comes to wanting a job!! The place is clean, they provide snacks for you while you wait! After speaking to the doctor - who appeared to have not even looked at my chart- missing vital info like I was on a medication dangerous for trying to conceive- I was told to come in over and over for monitoring . I did this a few times- never understanding what I was doing or receiving any follow up . Along the way 10+ precious years passedAt the time of hopelessness, we came across New Hope and Dr Zhang The first thing Dr Zhang told us was that there is no problem with you, tests are all good, all you need to do is to nourish your body and get ready . I am persistently calling to speak with someone about my embryos and I have been calling for days . 4th cycle experience we had to restart our cycle 2 times Let me explain . I was recommended for treatments using donor eggs at the first consultation at a clinic in NJ before my treatment wasn't even started because I was 43 . Also, the clinic in NJ made me feel pressured to use donor eggs and uncomfortable to continue treatments there due to my age . What I liked about NHFC is NHFC doctors listen to you and work with patients together . With great thanks to Dr Zhang, Dr Lui, Joanna (nurse) and Chisa (embryologist) who supported us thru this difficulty journey, our life changed with this miracle baby o(^-^)o . Thank you Dr Merhi and the New Hope staff! No one ever sat down with me and went over a schedule . None of the information I needed to have a successful cycle was provided . There were failures at EVERY step of my cycle . All of this excludes the points that can be made about false promises, unethical processes, undue stressI'm sure many women are hesitant to speak on this experience as it is a personal, private, medical process . I went to New Hope at age 42 after 2 failed IVF attempts that resulted in a miscarriage . consultation on August 25th, both prior and during this appointment their office confirmed that they accepted my insurance and listed New Hope as a participating provider on my paperwork No one bothered to mention that they would no longer be a participating provider as of September 1st - 7 days later! He is not going to sit there and commiserate with you about past failures . 1) be honest about your overall situation . However, it took us about 3 years trying for the second one with no success . We almost gave up hope but our friend who also had success with the IVF at New Hope recommended this place to us . Anyone who has gone through fertility treatments knows that it is a stressful and emotional process . After years of trying at other facilities that treated us as just another experiment, we conceived More than anything, we are thrilled to have achieved a healthy pregnancy and to have welcomed a beautiful baby girl! Third, in my case at least, I fell like Dr Zhang's more natural approach to the hormones intake end up fitting . I felt like I was in one of those terrible lectures where they try to sell you time share! . She is a nurse and Dr Zhang is a doctor . Since when did Doctor's and Nurses stop taking blood? . I only needed to wait 15 minutes before I went in to consult with Dr Zhang . Bottom line - Dr Zhang is a money hungry doctor . I met with his mentor at NYU who told me, Let's just say he is a business man . It got the point where I told the office that I don't ever want to speak with him again and will only communicate with Dr Luk, who actually is amazing . What I have found is fertility doctors are trained to do this: figure out why you are not able to get pregnant, pump you with meds and try to get you to do an IUI or IVF until you finally say no more . Dr Zhang was the worst because he did not care to ever have a conversation . No kidding - after my last IVF failed, the nurses (not Dr Zhang) called to say, Come on in when your cycle starts so we can schedule your next IVFI believe the overall methodology that NH has embarked on is top notch and found Dr Zhang to be very knowledgeable for insemination like they wanted, I came on day 11 and went from there ."
8,New Hope Fertility Center,advice," I never left not knowing what was happening I went back and New hope lifted my spirits They let me know that we would be trying again next cycle Then comes COVID-19 I wish that I could stay here throughout my whole pregnancy New Hope gave me the one thing I personally couldn't give myself so it's well worth it and a small problem to have Thank you everyone at New Hope!! You're angels and I'll always appreciate you all Dr Makarov, Katherine, Daisy, Oksana, Joanna, Wei, Katie and sooo many moreSo thankful that I made it to NHFC Please don't give up other prospective parents, it is not a matter of whether or not it will happen, it is WHEN it will happen Do give NHFC a try From the first day we arrived at the center, my husband and I KNEW we made the best choice possible; the same day NYC officially re-opened and I think it's quite cool to tell my future kids about the day they were conceived Also, I'm 39 & went through the Mini-IVF treatment which no one else in the city is capable of providing you with such a treatment besides the experts at New Hope Fertility I liked the center's philosophy on trying to get quality ovums and blastocysts over quantity to better your chancesI am reposting my review with more clarity  If you freeze your eggs at New Hope Fertility and then want to go to another facility- your eggs will not be accepted   This is so important for women to know  Reputable centers will not take the eggs !  Please see attached email photos   New hope fertility is disorganized- which is the last thing you would want while going thru fertility treatment  Keeping accurate records of payment- these are all importantWanted to write this review as I sit in the hospital in recovery Not only can I relate but I can sympathize with everyone who is also a patient at New Hope Fertility Center A baby I thought I would never be able to carry or hold myself Just know as a employee and patient at new hope fertility center I can relate and sympathize with you all! I tried to reach out to the billing department several times but are not addressing my questions nor want to acknowledge the fact that they should have notified me about the eventuality of a costI was against the genetic testing and was pushed  to do it Now that I am thinking about this horrible pushy experience where the doctors wants to make money more than you having a child, I am sure it was done on purposeThis was one of the worst doctor experiences I've ever had This is very long, but please read because I do not want this to happen to anyone else She didn't hear anything about history or even ask how often we were having sex (something that I think you'd probably want to start with) I had asked several people while I waiting to make sure they knew the reason we were there and that we were told to come in before the genetic test reading She apologized about the confusion and said that the test would be performed right away She let me know that I had come in ""much too late"" for that and that I did not follow the instructions that were provided to me She then told me, ""oh, don't listen to her She then told me I was just ""uneducated,"" but said that they would still be able to perform this test today magically A few issues, one, I didn't do the recommended tests yet, two, I used an OPK when I woke up the day of the test and I wasn't ovulating (though I know these aren't 100% accurate), third, New Hope won't enroll you in Aetna's fertility program, you We now are going to Kofinas Fertility and it's amazingI think the fact that they stayed open throughout the entire coronavirus pandemic says a lot about their business and philosophy  Money is their MO""  There is no excuse for that period  It is definitely NOT individualized Towards the end of the session (after 15 hours of a full blown sales pitch), her immediate question was ""What should I put you down for? IVF treatments?"" Again, there was no indication that she had any intention to better understand if fertility treatments are even needed She was trying to put pressure on the need to start treatments immediately/not waste time and categorized us as ""infertile"" with no warranted facts; she was trying to prey on a couple's fear and failed, miserably, but I can see many couple's trying for a much longer time and easily falling for this tactic  I would strongly caution anyone looking to start this journey with this practice Find a Dr that will use proper measures to come up with a non-invasive / cost effective treatment planPlanned on writing this review AFTER my procedures, however, decided to do it early  Partner and I really enjoyed our experience with the doctor and team  I then thought, maybe they're nice because it's the first visit  Not sure what the outcome will be, but I have never been more pleased with New Hope  When I speak to other people about infertility problems, I happily recommend NHFC If you do the monitoring early morning, then speaking to a doctor is awarded if you ask for it Good luck ladies, wishing you success, I'm with you on this hard journey!!! He really is the best doctor I have met in my life He listens​ to you and proposes​ the best option At that time, I learned​ that he is the doctor that really cares​ about patients​ I wish they explain better or enrich the website​ articles and forms Thus for a long time, I did not know how much I was paying They just charge​d from my credit card Thank you so much and all the best to people who are​ considering​ to go to NHFCand it's a significant one I know this bc they have been a major barrier as to why I haven't come in for more rounds of freezing That's how revenue is generated after all I don't know if the doctors know how much this team is hindering their profits but I hope they see it and figure it out soon  Let's not even go there with my PCOS I only had optimism and not really a clear picture on what my issues really were Dr Jennifer Kulp-Makarav worked with me, she looked into every crack and crevasse she could and was patient with me Look, in a nutshell this is a one stop shop, and if you want to find out what's going on AND get pregnant this is the place If I have any complaints, it would be the fact that they dont deliver the actual baby lol I dont want to trust anyone else with my miracle but them!!! Best experience everOther things is unhappy  Special shout out to the PAs who draw my blood every day because I am NOT an easy stick, and they never lose their patience or hesitate to ask a colleague for assistance if needed  Any time I've wanted to speak to the doctor, he makes time for meI have had success because my case wasn't very complicated You have to be extremely well informed about the processes and be pesky and ask a lot of questions, unfortunately, to which you may or may not get all your answers You will not get the one on one attention you may have hoped for They asked me to do the blood test and ultrasound before even talk to the doctor First time here, definitely the last time as well!!! He also matter of fact and practical  I had an appointment with one doctor, who canceled on me and was rescheduled with a new doctor  What? Do I need IVF yet? No one has even spoken to me It should be noted that we were regularly reminded how poor our odds of success were, and the doctor agreed that stopping made senseMonths later we received an inquiry about our lapse, and when we'd be resuming treatment Guess they put more value in saving the money they might invest in customer supportSTAY AWAY!!! RUN RUN RUN!!!New Hope Fertility Center should be called ""NO hope"" For example, they even let junior embryologist directly do ICSI without going through training Save your time and stay away Don't believe their good success rate on SART!!! It is tricky! I heard patients like me who never get a chance to transfer an embryos won't be counted as data points for SART  We found a famous doctor in NJ, tried rounds of artificial insemination and 3 IVFs in total, all failed  We were told the prospect looked dismal, and we should think about donor eggs, surrogacy or adoption The analogy he used was that you need to have a fertile ground first before you implant seedsOh, boy, didn't we try hard to ""get ready"" - exercises, diets, emotional balance, herb medicine After months, we were told we were readyI just tried for baby #2 and had a very disappointing experience There was a moment that I really needed to see a doc and ofcourse that didn't happen I wish that I had gotten better care  The facility lets patients go home after one hour after IVF sedation  But something needs to change as its dangerous and suboptimal in delivery of care  Maybe provide a chaperone?  Or stress the importance of having someone there to take them home after the procedure The facility is a waste of your time and money The physician never came when i had an appointment to see her "" False hope facility"" seem it will string you along if i didn't come to my sensesNHFC approach is that they could care less This is a place where you need to advocate for yourself and hope, as that's the best you will get  We took a break to mentally prepare ourselves We knew we want one doctor to follow our case  We requested the same doctor after every monitoring  We could not get our doctor to speak to us  Follicle recruitment as expected  We asked for our doctor to follow up  We didnt want to repeat history Asked to speak to the doctor No good responses  This was very disappointing as you may expected  He was very nice on the phone and asked us to try again  The doctor admitted that another doctor looked our case while he was on vacation That doctor did not know how my wife's reaction to clomid is  No one came to talk to us till we are ready to our 5th cycle  The doctors are always busy in the OR  I only want to think happy thoughts  NHFC may be working for a lot of couples today  The doctors are busy in the OR with egg retrieval If you want to learn more about our experience and what to ask, maybe that conversation will be invaluable to you  We wish you the best  We all came here to start a family or grow our familyDo not go here if it is your first time seeking treatment  After going thru conventional 2 IVFs, I decided to change my clinic because I was so depressed and hopeless since I couldn't get any blastocysts From our initial visit, we fell in love with Dr Merhi The communication at NHFC is awesome as most communication is done through a confidential email system, with respect to scheduling follow up appointments and in providing test results He did not rush any component of the procedure, even though it took us a little longer than expected If we plan on having more children, we definitely know we will return to NHFC, without a doubtI was followed by Dr Zaher Merhi I was diagnosed with PCOS which is probably the simplest condition to treat Well they only try to make you spend more money They only want your money I wish all of you good luck for this journey, try to listen more than one Doctor I was riding down the elevator and the sweetest blonde woman asked me how I was feeling I must have been visibly disappointed I thought she was a stranger not minding her own businessI didn't realize she worked there because her id was hidden but she introduced herself as the Director of Marketing, Jaclyn I have to say after speaking with her I could not have felt better about my decision to choose NHFC Choosing a doctor is as important as choosing a clinic I work with Dr Yang and I think he is the best Furthermore, he is a very experienced surgeon He conducts procedure himself for his own patients I will tell you that many of his patients would rather skip a cycle when he is on vacation Also, ask your doctor which method of communication he or she prefers This will save you from lots of anxiety If you see an instruction that looks off, communicate with your doctor to make sure dosage or time is right We all need emotional support! 4 Consult your family doctor for a second opinion if you have an abnormal blood result or a test run and a report is available Another set of eyes always help Your own wellbeing is as important as a future baby Stay happy and stay strong but outside of this, you won't hear from themDoctor Kulp-Makarov is the best fertility doctor one could ask for She helps you stay hopeful even at the toughest of moments Most of all, she is very talented at what she does, and you couldn't ask for someone more effective and knowledgeable Amazing to have someone thinking outside the box! Other places won't do this and will push you to donor I preferred Dr Liu as I found him to be more responsive and willing to discuss my questions/concerns I found this to be a bit frustrating because I had to re-explain specific issues or concerns when I had questions However I know this is a outlet many may review when it comes to making this important decision I want to say it was a long journey almost a year, very expensive but well worth it I am 9 weeks pregnant There was this one girl who had such a heavy Chinese accent I had to ask her repeatedly what she said, and then she gets angry Again, not the best experienceI would suggest you try your luck with some other place before deciding on this one He's the best! Unfortunately, he was kicked out of New Hope Fertility Center  I made clear my travel dates and they were ignored completely  You see below that this is the ready response to any of their failures  It was pure incompetence, or more likely, general disinterest in the patient's needs, but the response is to blame it on the woman and her body  New Hope retrieved only 6  These are real numbers  To ask a woman to invest financially, physically, medically, temporally in this process and not take all measures, let alone any measures to ensure the ideal outcome on her behalf is ENTIRELY UNETHICAL  Women, mothers deserve better  I am not happy to be putting this experience on the internet, but I believe in this process and the importance of a woman's newfound ability to extend her fertility in the face of modern career and family challengesAn update to my last review  We had our baby boy!  He is perfect Stay away from this clinic In and out on time and without hassle Not for us here at New Hope It had been a very stressful journey doing IVF but it now ended perfectly at NHFC  The feeling I got from my month at New Hope was that they want to administer IVF to as many patients as possible and to generally do as much medically as possible whether its needed or notI'd already settled my account You never see the same nurses and doctors so they never really know what the last person has said to you They pressure you into things you don't want and don't share useful options unless you know to ask He was always so supportive and communicative, letting me know the exact next steps and eased all my worries and concerns He genuinely loves his job of granting miracles to infertility patientsI had never wrote reviews on yelp, but looking at my beautiful angel's face, Im so thankful and grateful, I have to give NHFC the credits I know I will be back for my second baby Thanks NHF for a great job!!!If you are considering purchasing donor eggs from New Hope, be sure you question them and the FDA about the status of their failed FDA inspection in 2014 They received several warning letters and at the time had not complied in full This would also concern me about their lab in general None of the other fertility centers do that Take heed of this and ask the right questions I feel so relaxed when I am there! Enough saidMy husband and I have been to a number of fertility clinics trying to conceive and finally at the first try at New hope we are expecting our little girl in a couple of weeks  I highly recommend Dr Merhi our doctor who was truly the best as we hit various obstacles  His compassion and care for what he does makes him in my opinion he best Just one word of advice, they get many clients so it helps to be on top of your own baby ""game""I'm still trying to give this place at chance I've been coming here for 6 months now, and seems like the longer I stay here the more frustration I have with them It wasn't until I really sat down and read about my coverage that I realized they were wrong I called them and I brought it to their attention and they agreed I was right Because of their error, I ended up doing something that I did not need to and therefore wasted a month Till today, they have not owned up to their mistake and apologized to us They considered a ""3 sentence from a doctor who is talking to me in the hallway outside their sonogram rooms"", this to them is a doctor's consultation!Unfortunately I'm not knowledgeable enough to know if they are messing up with actual important stuff which is the success of the procedure I am just an obedient patient who does whatever they tell me and hope for the best But sometimes, when I think about the things that annoy me about them, makes me think about what else could they be messing up with, missing or mishandling Sometimes I really wonder if my success is their success Maybe, at 6+ months now, if I had news such as I am pregnant, I would ignore all of the above My husband and I felt like we constantly had to ask them for information and hope that we were asking the right questions I can understand that if you're a patient used to ""the drill"" that this hand holding may not be necessary For a first-time IVF-er, though, I expected more walking through each step and explanations throughout the process I can't say enough good things about him Dr Merhi is an excellent doctor No matter what, infertility is stressful, though Dr Merhi did everything he could to make the process as smooth as possible But 100% worth it 3 other doctors turned their backs on me Good luck everyone Try New Hope in NYC"" He was very honest with us I didn't mind that they kept their distance a little We're all on hormones Maybe this is why I had such a good experience This past Wednesday, I had a D&C at New Hope Dr Liu patted my hand before the procedure and told me how sorry he was Even though we are devastated by our loss, we can never say that we weren't well aware of the odds Having gone through this, I now know that I have done everything I can to try to conceive using my eggs I know that if I wanted to continue, NHFC would allow me to I don't think it's fully because of getting paid, I think it's because they allow couples to follow the path they choose We are now ready to talk about using donor eggs My emotions are running high right now, but I would still, unequivocally, recommend New Hope Fertility Center  He is consistently in the 95 percentile at all his check ups, considered advanced in his daycare and is very brightCame to NHFC for a second opinion and ended up sticking to their careI don't know if they deliberately lied to us, or were just incompetent (I would hope the latter) but if you're planning to use insurance here - beware! New Hope treats its patients as walking paychecks You're shuffled from one station to the next like a piece of meat rather than a person Dr Zhang actually had his hand on the doorknob as we were asking him questions You certainly won't find it here That's all that matters - the result!Hello All!  I started this review in 2014 and made it a point to complete it today  I have reviewed New Hope before, but I am here to review it again for the second time, as I have had my second child -- first, by the grace of God and then, by being in the hands of Drs  If you are not a good candidate for IVF, he will let you know, but most likely will offer other options of achieving pregnancy; and, 2) he will fully review your history and put you on the best path possible to fulfill your dream of becoming a parent  When you decide to embark on this journey, you have to be prepared to fail as not everyone gets lucky right away  After 3 failures, I thought I was doomed  However, I was compelled to continue and keep trying because I wanted this more than anythingAs you read this, you may be thinking that I have a lot of money  Today, when I look at my two boys, the thought of a zero balance in that account means absolutely nothing  For the negative reviews you see here, my advice is this, go to the SART website (sart  This is the reporting organization for assisted reproductive technologiesNo matter what route you decide to take, I wish everyone who reads my post and who is trying to achieve pregnancy the very best of luck  We went to New Hope fertility because I had read how they were more into natural fertility (in other words, they didn't pump you with drugs, but worked more with your one ovulation cycle)   Sincerely, Lynne Walrod All these arangemnts and suggeestions were valuable and I thought well of thm because of them I even put a complaint while going there, since if you don't ask they don't give esplicationlet's say they follow you very accurately but you just have to obey and no many words are spent if you are , like m, someone that wants to know, understand and decide, ask and insist to see the doctor, since you ar not going to see him much I saw someone wrote they are not sensible to what a woman wants or need, this may seem true, in the sense that theer is no space for emotionality or talking or venitng, it is a little robotic and just straitghforwardthey should definitely get better in customer care, communication and tact, but  if you understand that and go around that and take the good things, you may be happy and have a good job done on you They did a very good job with our case and I am sur with everybody, no matter if you get a child or not As per billling and pricceing, I think they are honest and not expensive, they just charge you per step and thy are honest in avoiding you useless steps if it is not the case, wihtout using sweet words sometimes, just tlling you on the face but I prefer to be told the truth instaed of being given what I ask for when it is not going to work Good luck to everybody) However, what was impressive is that they reached out when I expressed frustration, and genuinely seemed to care about my experience and how to make it better in the future You can never call and speak to a person I went in person spoke to 2 different people: one had to run for a ""meeting"" it was lunch time, second asked me to look into my account and call me back tomorrow I went back in person  next day she was sitting at her desk looked at me and asked "" how can I help you"", really?! That was Ms you got no recourse After, don't expect anything They look at the sonogram and don't have any knowledge of the history Especially since Zhong got media attention They make millions but don't have more than one doctor on week ends? It's a joke He was so communicative and available for any questions and concerns we had and it made all the difference in the world to usVery bad treatment and financial planning Bad customer response when confronted with request for explanation  Messy treatment procedure  My wife was asked by the doctor to have her 4th IUI and they collected my specimen only to find they messed up my wife's ovation date and need to reschedule to two days later  But still tried to continue with IVF until they kept asking us to fill medications on a very short notice period  Such irresponsibility, and unprofessionalism should really lead their name to be ""No Hope"" Still have no ideaI went to New Hope after being rejected by two other doctors After few tries it did happen and now I have a baby girl They wasted my time with their assembly-line tactics and robbed me of a year of my fertility I was never told that these would not be destroyed after we terminated our relationship and they refunded our money They never said I needed to do anything in particular to make sure that they wouldn't keep my biological material The process for getting our account cleared and our biological material destroyed has been HELL At this point what they're putting me through is a form of harassment and abuse There weren't public reviews back then so I'm writing this that people are able to make an educated choice Fertility issues are hard enough  As soon as we enter the center we knew we were at the right place and we literally said we have ""new hope"" Dr Merhi and the entire staff were so attentive to our needs and listened carefully to every concern we had! They guided us every step of the way  When ever we had questions we felt comfortable asking  He assured me we will figure it out and we did We truly believe it was all due to Dr Merhi, Nurse Lisa and everyone at New Hope! New Hope Center is truly about helping you conceiveI decided to try New Hope (NH) after a friend of mine mentioned about the placeIn 2013 my husband and I joined the New Hope Fertility Center IVF trial Our experience with them was awesome Maciej has a quiet rational that inspires trust I recommend New Hope Fertility Center without any hesitations Plus, being in New York we had lots of fun there when we had to travel for the treatment Five stars through and through! It was New Hope's misinformation that misled us thinking our treatment (embryo banking) would be covered Going to New Hope is my worst decision on my infertility journeyI enrolled in the study of mini-IVF at New Hope 2011 Sep;23(3):274-8 Epub 2011 Jun 26 The data presented failed to support their conclusions Therefore, presented here is a critique of their manuscript and of uncontrolled clinical use of LI-IVF, in general In the absence of properly controlled studies, all forms of LI-IVF should be considered experimental and be offered only in well-controlled research settings and with appropriate informed consentI'm really on the fence about NHFC, after dealing with a new Fertility Center who caught some disturbing numbers in my records My Hormone levels indicated some issues and my current/new RE is questioning them and wondering why no one - no Doctor at NHFC has brought this up with me and still went through with my first IUI (which was unsuccessful; as was the subsequent) I really want to like NHFC Unfortunately I think that they have alot of work to do to garner more stars than the 2 I generously give nowPREPARE TO BE IGNORED BY NHFC!I never write reviews, but felt compelled to write one about this careless, useless & hopeless place!  DO NOT get suckered into going here for fertility treatment If you do, here's what you can expect:You will be impressed by your first visit They'll set you up with your initial consultation very quickly They will be very nice to you, but it won't seem genuine They will assure you of their ability & willingness to answer any of your questions & concernsYou will go home You will have a question or two or three, now that you've had time to digest the limited information they gave you If you were treated anywhere else before now,you will be disappointed at the lack of info in comparison to your last RE Your email will be ignored You will not hear from them  I have tried all options and have still hit a hard stop  At this point I have decided to request my records and seek care elsewhere  Someone within this company NEEDS TO TAKE A SERIOUS  LOOK AT THE BILLING PROCESS AND PROCEDURES!!! Even my INS advised me to look for a clinic with better financial  communication They will rush you in, push you into treatments that don't make sense, and bring you back as often as possible in order to continue to charge you each month  He avoided and skirted our questions when we him asked why we would do IVF when there was no clear diagnosis I thought this was odd  There names were Diane and Justine   There ARE other places in this vicinity that will give you a serious consultation and listen take all of your concerns  These other clinics I speak of understand how important communication and  a doctor patient relationship is  Save your time, money and heartache - steer clear of New Hope Fertility and Dr Zhang Won't call again, won't put the health of my family in hands of a clinic with such an initial bad attitudeAs I write this review, I'm looking at my healthy baby boy, who wouldn't be here if it weren't for New Hope  The technology he is using is superb, the volume of patients in his office speaks louder than words No one will guarantee you a 100% pregnancy, but I know this place will give you the best chance you have at getting it! I have been through hell and back with infertility problems and did 2 IVFs with the other clinics in NY like Cornell I highly recommend them to assist with your fertility needs , they are miracle makers and I am forever indebted to them for my blessing  Well, I went to Zhang *after* going to that doctor (he's definitely skilled & the best doc at NYU-FC) & after that guy's institution took nearly six-figures worth of our money -- our savings -- how much of savings does that NYU guy have? Meanwhile that NYU doc gets paid a seven-figure salary from NYU plus doing glamour stints on TV shows, etc It's cookie-cutter by comparison And good luck avoiding Dr Nicole Noyes on the days when she's in charge They're a younger, smaller institution I wish all of you the best of luckI wanted to share my experience with New Hope Fertility Center  I had my first appointment today  I will keep you guys posted about my experience  My next appointment is in 2 weeks  I have done every treatment imaginable  I am also from the pharmaceutical industry, so I know a lot about what goes on behind the scenes He must have hired a coach because he said all the right things but did not do anything  And I am actually not working with them at the moment and decided to go to an acupuncturist""  They don't ask about whether stress is a factorI wish you all the best in your journey  For the premium they charge to their peers, I would have expected superior customer service- what received was subpar No one tells you anything and email responses are spotty depending on what you are asking  Have all of your questions when you come and grab the nurses then and maybe, possibly, you might have a minute with the doctor or they can check with the doctor and get back to you  I hope this info helpsthe good thing about NH is that they don't turn anyone away the problem is that the doctors are too overworked to really listen to you and expensive mistakes happen then they are unavailable to meet or speak with you  in addition,  the Human Resources dept doesn't address any of your concerns and deliberately avoids you  i should have listened to the reviews and saved my time and money","I never left not knowing what was happening I went back and New hope lifted my spirits They let me know that we would be trying again next cycle Then comes COVID-19 I wish that I could stay here throughout my whole pregnancy New Hope gave me the one thing I personally couldn't give myself so it's well worth it and a small problem to have Thank you everyone at New Hope!! If you freeze your eggs at New Hope Fertility and then want to go to another facility- your eggs will not be accepted . Reputable centers will not take the eggs ! . New hope fertility is disorganized- which is the last thing you would want while going thru fertility treatment . Partner and I really enjoyed our experience with the doctor and team . Not sure what the outcome will be, but I have never been more pleased with New Hope . Best experience everOther things is unhappy . Any time I've wanted to speak to the doctor, he makes time for meI have had success because my case wasn't very complicated You have to be extremely well informed about the processes and be pesky and ask a lot of questions, unfortunately, to which you may or may not get all your answers You will not get the one on one attention you may have hoped for They asked me to do the blood test and ultrasound before even talk to the doctor First time here, definitely the last time as well!!! I had an appointment with one doctor, who canceled on me and was rescheduled with a new doctor . I heard patients like me who never get a chance to transfer an embryos won't be counted as data points for SART . But something needs to change as its dangerous and suboptimal in delivery of care . We took a break to mentally prepare ourselves We knew we want one doctor to follow our case . We requested the same doctor after every monitoring . We could not get our doctor to speak to us . We didnt want to repeat history Asked to speak to the doctor No good responses . This was very disappointing as you may expected . He was very nice on the phone and asked us to try again . No one came to talk to us till we are ready to our 5th cycle . The doctors are busy in the OR with egg retrieval If you want to learn more about our experience and what to ask, maybe that conversation will be invaluable to you . We all came here to start a family or grow our familyDo not go here if it is your first time seeking treatment . 4 Consult your family doctor for a second opinion if you have an abnormal blood result or a test run and a report is available Another set of eyes always help Your own wellbeing is as important as a future baby Stay happy and stay strong but outside of this, you won't hear from themDoctor Kulp-Makarov is the best fertility doctor one could ask for She helps you stay hopeful even at the toughest of moments Most of all, she is very talented at what she does, and you couldn't ask for someone more effective and knowledgeable Amazing to have someone thinking outside the box! Unfortunately, he was kicked out of New Hope Fertility Center . You see below that this is the ready response to any of their failures . To ask a woman to invest financially, physically, medically, temporally in this process and not take all measures, let alone any measures to ensure the ideal outcome on her behalf is ENTIRELY UNETHICAL . I highly recommend Dr Merhi our doctor who was truly the best as we hit various obstacles . I started this review in 2014 and made it a point to complete it today . If you are not a good candidate for IVF, he will let you know, but most likely will offer other options of achieving pregnancy; and, 2) he will fully review your history and put you on the best path possible to fulfill your dream of becoming a parent . When you decide to embark on this journey, you have to be prepared to fail as not everyone gets lucky right away . After 3 failures, I thought I was doomed . For the negative reviews you see here, my advice is this, go to the SART website (sart . This is the reporting organization for assisted reproductive technologiesNo matter what route you decide to take, I wish everyone who reads my post and who is trying to achieve pregnancy the very best of luck . next day she was sitting at her desk looked at me and asked  how can I help you, really?! It's a joke He was so communicative and available for any questions and concerns we had and it made all the difference in the world to usVery bad treatment and financial planning Bad customer response when confronted with request for explanation . I have tried all options and have still hit a hard stop . At this point I have decided to request my records and seek care elsewhere . Someone within this company NEEDS TO TAKE A SERIOUS . LOOK AT THE BILLING PROCESS AND PROCEDURES!!! Even my INS advised me to look for a clinic with better financial . These other clinics I speak of understand how important communication and . I will keep you guys posted about my experience . I am also from the pharmaceutical industry, so I know a lot about what goes on behind the scenes He must have hired a coach because he said all the right things but did not do anything . They don't ask about whether stress is a factorI wish you all the best in your journey . For the premium they charge to their peers, I would have expected superior customer service- what received was subpar No one tells you anything and email responses are spotty depending on what you are asking . Have all of your questions when you come and grab the nurses then and maybe, possibly, you might have a minute with the doctor or they can check with the doctor and get back to you . the Human Resources dept doesn't address any of your concerns and deliberately avoids you ."
9,New Hope Fertility Center,nurse,"  I did not get a response and had to email to get a resp  When not at the center and I have questions, I send them an email They will outright ignore you - emails, phone calls, messages from the front desk etc I mentioned them often and frequently to friends She was always available and the visits were quick, clear and concise with instruction as to what course of action she was taking  This process was actually affordable too believe it or not  The nurses are wonderful and responsive as is the prescription coordinator  I get responses to my emails usually right away but always within a few hours He makes himself available to answer questions and is very reassuring But when I called she was not only rude but refused to even take a message for Zhang  So we got our instructions for after the first monitoring - expected instructions I found phone calls frustrating at times because they are incredibly busyI emailed them few times to inquire about something, no responses i showed up to the office just to get an answer the only time they will respond to your question is during monitoring when they first email you the result and than you reply to their email with a question like on the medication quantity) Also, unlike Weill Cornell, you don't have one nurse assigned to you They sent us a form to fill up which we did They told us they would need to go over it on the phoneBilling is hard to reach  other then that i love the place Dr yang is amazing very sweet staff over the phone very helpful i fogot her name but she was so nice when booking my first appointment i loved it They work very efficient,fast with my insuance the nurses are very helful by email and by phone i highly reomend this place They have been very helpful and most importantly they take all your concerns in a timely manner! They either call you immediately or send you emails to explain the plans in details A lot of the times when I emailed the nurses, I don't get a response until the next day or if at all, and this is considering that I sent the email before noon He answered my million questions and always followed up to see if I was doing ok I found communicating with the nurses via email the easiest way to get answers to my questions If I hadn't heard from them in an hour or so, I just emailed them again and got my answer The problem is they do not return calls He is incredibly knowledgeable and compassionate They refuse to speak to you or communicate directly, rather they send you messages that require login into a special system each time, (you get an email telling you to log in for your message rather than an email with the actual message!) I have been given the run around - asked to send things notarized (which I have done) and still they are not satisfied  When we finally reached out to Nurse Lisa, whom we had the pleasure to getting help from at another center and she guided us to Dr Merhi at New Hope Nurse Lisa answered all our questions about the medications and always was available when we reached out We will forever be grateful to Dr Merhi, Nurse Lisa and the entire staff at New Hope!!At NH, yes it is like a factory, but they are so much more efficient (from signing up electronically to communicating via secured email with nurses to getting all your results via email) Tania went above and beyond the call of duty to answer any questions that we had and guide us along this journey, she is invaluableYou will be sent home with some information but lots of questions The nurses will not return your call You will send an email The nurses will not reply to your email You will call and email again There is NO communication at all Now it's a week, and NO email or explanation about anything  During this whole process, I was met with 2 nurses that were incredibly frustrating and not helpful You don't see him often after your first appointment, but who cares, they have an amazing staff of nurses  He NEVER responded to my email  Tell the nurse","I did not get a response and had to email to get a resp . When not at the center and I have questions, I send them an email They will outright ignore you - emails, phone calls, messages from the front desk etc I mentioned them often and frequently to friends She was always available and the visits were quick, clear and concise with instruction as to what course of action she was taking . This process was actually affordable too believe it or not . The nurses are wonderful and responsive as is the prescription coordinator . I get responses to my emails usually right away but always within a few hours He makes himself available to answer questions and is very reassuring But when I called she was not only rude but refused to even take a message for Zhang . other then that i love the place Dr yang is amazing very sweet staff over the phone very helpful i fogot her name but she was so nice when booking my first appointment i loved it They work very efficient,fast with my insuance the nurses are very helful by email and by phone i highly reomend this place They have been very helpful and most importantly they take all your concerns in a timely manner!

10,New Hope Fertility Center,clinic," When I first got to New hope I was impressed by the facility It was clean and the staff was friendly The phlebotomist, the nurses and Dr Makarov were always incredible, and very informative I thought it was all over but the clinic stays open and checks our temperature at the door, has a nurse pumping hand sanitizer into our hands, the whole staff began wearing face masks and shields, the seats are separated for social distancing I'm currently 10 weeks and have just graduated and will now be seeing a OBGYN and am pretty sad After 5 IUIs at Weill Cornell, 3 IVF cycles at RMA NY (horrible horrible!) and then finally 2 rounds at NHFC, we are blessed with a beautiful baby girl The aquarium in the waiting area is so soothing! Did I mention how kind everyone here is?!? It's somewhat surreal The procedure was pain free thanks to a wonderful  anesthesiologist and the pain afterwards was tolerable New Hope Fertility was my answered prayer to starting my family and I'm grateful to be on this journey with such an phenomenal place But it turns out that I got pregnant on the first try! The staff, including all the nurses, are very nice and accommodating, and the office hours are such that you can come in at various hours making it convenient if you work long hours like I doMy only issue with the place would be that the billing department doles out information in a confusing manner sometimes  This whole experience is turning into a nightmare I am a doctor and fully understand how a clinic should be run  Your staff to your billing department are key to your success You are just another number and more money She's breathing and eating on here own at 5 lbs 15oz and 20 inches long and have her grand entrance at 35 weeks All the staff at New Hope was extremely helpful and efficient throughout my process and I do not only say that because I am an employee I say it as a patient This process in itself can be extremely stressful and draining so a big thanks to everyone involved for making it easier for me even while working and shedding my tears Before the procedure I have asked the billing department of everything was ok and if they received the pre authorization I am now  in another fertility clinic in Oradell and it is night and day!!! Also after doing research on New Hope, the way they are handling their business is definitely borderline In any case I wouldn't recognize this clinic at all and if you have experience similar issues please reach out to me I would love to investigate further Cannot say enough horrible things about this place I had to come back for a saline test and I spoke with the nurse who told me to come in before my test results They made me wait over 2 hours to get a saline test before I had to come in to read my genetic test results They all confirmed and stated that it would only be a few more minutes She replied, ""The ultrasound??"" to which I said  I told her that the nurse asked what day of my cycle I would be on and said it was fine for me to come"" Ok, that's terrifying I hate that I had to go through such an awful, degrading experience, however it lead us to Kofinas so it was a blessing in disguise Clearly protecting their staff and patients and contributing to the safety of the general public is NOT part of their MO  My dentist closed down her clinic and donated all of her PPE to the nearest hospital  I left New Hope years ago and I am glad that I did  It is poorly run and impersonal  Half of the staff there are nice and courteous and helpful  The other half hate their jobs and take it out on the patients There was this one ultrasound tech who was rude, sullen, and dismissive for days until one of her colleagues had to apologize to me saying she was ""having a bad week  The only part of their staff that is functional, nice, and efficient is their phlebotomists--very professional as a whole and well-trained  Most of the medical decisions are made by the nurses by some sort of protocol  I find it interesting that Cynthia B wrote a great review and she is an employee  And there are several ""great"" reviews by people who have not written any other reviews (hmmm, could they be biased employees? who have faked an account to sing glories about their place of employment?)  Though I was very wary of coming here due to the negative comments, I decided to try it anyway because of their ""quality vs  I was treated very well by the phlebotomist and the nurse who did my transvaginal ultrasound  Never had the latter done, but the nurse explained everything about the process as well as what I was seeing on the screen  Nope, I've gone at least a handful of times (even more in the future) and every time had a professional and respectful experienceSo far I am very happy with this fertility clinic, and it is my fifth one He seems to look at my case individually, not just following the same protocol for all, which is what I find to be the case for most clinics, where they treat you like a number, or kettle, no reasoning in mind Their clinic is very pleasant with large windows to Columbus Circle and part of Central Park, and natural light is always welcome while going through hard times Their system is very efficient as well, which allows for their high demand to not leave us lost in the midst of infertility fog About the NHFC, I believe it is a good clinic ​They have​ a great facility​, skilled staff and method​​ to perform a ​ton of success cases They generally work very quick and efficient On the other hand, I also agree with other people​ that they can re-organize their structure a bit more A minor problem was I unless I ask for the ​receipt​, the billing department never sent them to me  I hope the ​billing department sends​ receipt​​ every time​ they use my filed credit card I've had a (mostly) good experience with them It is a bit of a factory and you need to take responsibility for raising a flag when you know something doesn't work with your body I do have to say that their major weakness These guys don't seem to be very good at their job (not submitting to insurance for long periods of time, sending surprise bills a year later) nor are they friendly or responsive I would give 5 stars if not for the billing teamUpdate: NHFC came back to me and said it was an error by their outsourced billing company They have zero-ed out charges on my account, and I appreciate that they rectified this mistakeThat being said, would be hesitant to come back for the actual procedure since I hate being surprised by unexpected bills/charges!Revised from 1 star to 3 for customer remediationReally lovely people and compassionate team of medical professionalsUpdate Update!!!!I changed my insurance and thanks to Dr Yang and his staff I am 9 weeks pregnant with my twins!! I did one cycle/round of IVF and our dreams are coming true!! We are over the moon happy!! I know this sounds crazy but I am going to miss the staff! They were always so pleasant and positive and that kept me motivated  The staff is so kind and caring - the front desk remembers my name when I come in even though they are looking at hundreds of faces each day  The sonogram technicians are all so sweet and patient with all my questions You have to be your own advocate when you are working with NHFC becasue often times you feel like staff/ docs/ nurses that communicate with you do not care  If you are coming from outside NYC, spending your time and effort traveling, you will often find yourself frustrated because a lot of your questions, be it about the procedures, billing are simply going to go unanswered Often to the point of missing the window of opportunity,instead it feels like a ""take it or leave it"" attitude that all the staff from top down seem to take I did recommend a few friends and family to the clinic hoping for success that I have had atleast with the procedure, but warning them that the treatment from staff from top down will feel a bit off Their accounts of severe lack of communication, billing irregularities, failing to find anyone to take up their issues to or treat them fairly as a customer, is worse than what i experienced and expected So i'm very weary about recommending the clinic again  You will find that the price is often time less than what you may pay at the IVF clinics in other parts of the country for similar procedures however, you will pay in terms of how little communications and explanations you will the scheduling, nursing staff, and doctors Overall, if you are from the city, well informed and educated about the procedures you are being recommended, know your rights as a patient, know the code of conduct expected of a Clinic like this, and know how to hold parties accountable - then go for it The genetic results (NICS) took longer than usual but overall I am happy I can't wait to be a mumThe clinic is like all New York clinicsThe only downside for me is the billing department of the clinicThe treatment, interactions and relationship with both administrative and medical staff was stellar The overall experience was always very informative, pleasant and helpful Both the doctor and staff were organized, knowledgeable and professional in all aspects of the care and specific treatments involved, and made me feel at ease and encouraged to ask any questions/make personalized requestsPoor Customer Service!!! After calling this office and speaking to the receptionist who then transferred my call to a Justine ROne star for the very nice nurses  After taking time off work and sitting in the waiting room for long past my appointment time, I was told that my new doctor was canceling and would call me that evening  In the meantime, I was to start bloodwork and monitoring  I was so scared off - it took me almost a year to summon the energy to try to find another clinic and go through it again  I am so thankful that I did because I found a clinic and doctor who have made the process so much easier by treating me like a human being  I am currently in my first IVF cycle and wish I wouldn't have waited so long after this awful experience at New HopeWe had a great experience at New Hope  It put me at ease during those early weeks when anything could happenWhile it's wonderful that they offer more affordable fertility treatments, as compared to most other fertility clinics in the metropolitan area, they literally have no customer service On a few occasions we asked them who we might bring various issues to, so that the process went smoother, and nursing told us that they handled that The nurses are good at what they do but they are not prepared to handle issues with customer serviceThe place is very efficient and run like a factory, which is probably how they keep costs down, but also results in very impersonal treatment We received a short statement that we would no longer be communicated with If New Hope had a couple of people to actually support patients I think it would make a world of difference, but they don't seem to consider that with their current business model Their lab is well-known to be unstable and bad quality Can you believe that? This clinic just cares to take your money! They don't care about youSo I come for my IUI treatment but it got delayed due to the waiting time We had all sorts of tests, results were not bad but not great either In the end, lo and behold, I successfully had 2 beautiful babies although the pregnancy process was somewhat eventful with bleeding scares, kidney trouble, and bedridden orderGreat facility and I have had a good experience with the staff and care in my IVF journey  We do sign a waiver at the end of the procedure stating we are going home alone  I do understand that many patients do not have someone to take them home, especially since the procedures are scheduled during the day I was left unattended in the exam table After 30 minutes i decided to leave because i realized i was forgotten Hours past no one called me to see if i went to restroom or to see even if I leftGreat overall fertility center! Huge staff thats always willing to help The sonogrophers and nurses are particularly knowledgeable which was great when coming for ultrasounds in the morning The Billing department are vigilant in chasing you for your invoices I only wish the doctor would be as wellFed up with this place I haven't gotten calls from everyone from the doctor to the people who process insurance to billingFind ANY place elseI AM STILL waiting to get called back and I need my next round of meds desperatelyYou feel like an assembly line and the waiting room is like being at the DMV literally waiting for your name and number to be called  After the following monitoring we were told the follicles were gone  We were told from that monitor to continue to take  birth control pills via email instructions  We found out our doctor was not monitoring us like we requested  NHFC is not working for us If you are getting good bad indifferent results, please PM me  In part of that journey, I wish your experience will be a good one You are a number in their factoryI was treated at a big fertility clinic in NJ before going to New Hope  I saw many bad reviews about their billing dept, but I was fine maybe because I studied about my own insurance and knew how much they would need to charge me  When I had questions about my bills, I just went to see any billing staff and got answers The entire team at NHFC is extremely professional and helpful The staff truly works as a team to address patients The medical facility is well organized and the doctors have a forward thinking mindset in their research and expertise They are always working to make new breakthroughs to better help patients It was a bonus that they have early morning hours, starting at 7 am, and are open 7 days a week This made it easy to work appointments around my work schedule, and not have to take so much time offAt New Hope you are treated like a number, like a cog in an assembly line rather than a human being It is all about mass processing, which results in carelessness Long story short the first visit he was amazing i couldn't be happier to start this process First visit - ultrasound and blood test Nurse tells me i don't need any pills Bc i was ovulating 10 minutes after the visit the doctor tells me to wait my period and then to start with the pills to stimulate ovulation (But nurse who did the ultrasound said i was ovulating) I give 2 starts Bc the place is clean and beautiful and the nurses were always super friendly and super kind Instead the people who work in the front desk are just rude and They don't call you back if you have an emergencyMy thoughts and advice:1 Try to use emails when you need a prescription sent or have a billing question Most of my complaints with NH is regarding their nurse communications Positive thinking! It's not an easy journey so treat yourself once in a while they are pretty bad with communications She is patient, understanding, and kindNew hope is a very special place My doctor at new hope have me a different perspective Big thanks to the staff and vision at NHFCI sent few emails to their customer service to enquire about their services I did not get any response from them The only reply I get is from the administrator who is handling this account on Yelp If this is how you handle your customer service, you will not be able to get new customerVery efficient staff and clinic Cons: Billing department is pretty bad (poor communication skills and no follow up which means you spend a lot of time emailing, calling or going in-person to address mistakes on their end So your instructions are given by different nursesA yelp review doesn't seem like the appropriate place to review this facilityThe place seems very modern and nice and all that, but the people working there are not the nicest bunch The people at the front desk are not very helpful, and are rather rigid in their thinkingThe nursing staff seem ok, but some are not the bestLastly, they make you wait quite a long time some times My wife has had to wait over 2 hours on multiple occassions, even though she showed up on time for her appointment No communications, no solutions! The management of this clinic really sucks!The response you see from New Hope representatives is a perfect example of the misleading practices at this clinic  There was no consideration of my travel schedule at all  More importantly - It is a very easy out  to blame women's body's for the clinic's failures  I underwent a similar procedure in another state  I retrieved 24 eggs with that clinic  You see the difference in competency  The average clinic is able to retrieve (statistical averages) 70 % of the eggs  This clinic (though they claim extraordinary numbers) was able to retrieve less than half of the eggs I was able to produce  I have a number of friends who underwent this process at this clinic and their retrieval rates sit at 40 % among them  This business is founded, run and owned by menTerrible business practices The next morning, we received a call early in the morning  They went over the questionnaire for 5 minutesThis is the second day in a row we have come to this place with a 9:00 appointment Both days, we experienced incompetence and front desk mismanagement at their greatest I know of friends who visit other fertility clinics for the same procedure as my wife and I, and have a great experience We waited a total of 8 hours longer than expected Appointments mean absolutely nothing at this place The front desk attendants did not recognize our second day reservation in the system We were told ""next in line"" on several occasions as the hours passed by It's as if the concept of scheduling and office management 101 are completely foreign at this place Empty apologies and misinformation were all we received in our lengthy wait Any office - let alone a medical office - that manages itself in such a terrible, disorganized way instills very little confidence in what goes on beyond the waiting room My review here is not intended to reflect poorly on the doctors and medical staff who do so many good things for so many families My complaints and ire are solely directed at the management staff who perform their jobs horribly If I could give negative stars for our experience here I wouldI had a very positive experience with egg freezing at New Hope The staff was extremely polite and professional every time I went I never waited long at all It's always immaculately clean and I loved the aromatherapy scent in the airWe had a bad experience at a different Fertility clinic in NY and changed to New Hope We found the surroundings very nice, from the tea and coffee in the reception to all the examination/procedure rooms, it all felt very new and clean and much better than we experienced in the previous clinic The staff was all very nice and the system works well, it opens early which was good for our work schedule as well as being flexible when needed the cost system was very easy without the hidden fearsOverall I would recommend New Hope to anyone we speak to about IVF in NYThe worst billing department!  I've called 4 times in 3 weeks asking to just pay a bill and no one will call me back and I can never get anyone on the line! As for the service itself, DrZhang was very overzealous about getting me in to do IVF  I did have a positive experience with the lab techs and nursesUpdate, three years after settling my account, I started receiving bills again  All the services rendered were in June 2014 and included one doctors consultation and some minor lab work  When I reached out to the billing department to ask for an itemized bill explaining what I was being charged for, they told me my bill would be forgiven  Thats nice butThe front desk staff is rude and made of mostly empty headed idiots with nothing to offer Or if you really like superficial things and, like cucumber water, by all means, go here The first transfer in June 2016 took, and now I have a precious baby boy who turned 8 weeks today! There were a lot of frustrations with the receptionists and the insurance coordinator when I needed them to call in for meds coverage, and that was the most stressful part at NH But the nurses and lab Dept are very helpful and quick in responding emailsI would like to say that I had a great experience with NHF I have been with them for 1 year and Thanks all Doctors, nurses, medical assistants, and front desk who help me go through this stressful process I did post before a negative review about billing department but they corrected their mistake Other than that it was a wonderful experiencec…Other than this, the billing department at New Hope is a complete nightmare I just received yet another bill from them with a date of service that had never happened It always takes several calls/emails/months before they will rectify anything and every time I think everything is set with my bill, they send yet another billMy understanding is that New Hope used to be great many years ago when the doctors would actually examine and monitor the patients Now you are only monitored by nurses and in my opinion that is a big no-no He lent me one of the medications from the office until my order came in There is absolutely nothing to complain about the services from the front desk, billing department, nurses and doctors that I have encountered I have been to two other facilities prior to New Hope and all I received from them was WAIT and hope they will call me backThe facility at New Hope is clean They have an efficient system which makes the wait time relatively short  New hope is a very professional clinic with very respectable nurses and staff  Out of all the places we've been they are very responsive to questions and provided feedback in a very timely fashion He's very very knowledgeable and assisted with every issue The clinic is clean, organized, and as relaxing as a fertility clinic could be For the most part, all the nurses are  very nice and so are the doctors when you actually with them  There is a lot of lack of communication between patients and the medical staff When I call in to speak to a nurse, the receptionist will take my name and phone number, and I will get a call back near the end of the day, which in my opinion is not right I had my medical records from my obgyn faxed twice and they still claimed that they have not received them It seems like they don't have a system to properly file faxes as they come in Apparently there is a file with my name, but according to the nurse ""there is no way for me to go in to find the fax""The billing department there has annoyed me the most As a matter of fact they have corrected themselves and are making me believe that I was the one who misunderstood them! How could 2 grown up adults(my husband and I) have heard the same thing from 3 different people who now they claimed did not say!!!I feel like they like to bill my insurance for whatever they possible can The waiting time on the day of a procedure is horrendousThey have no problem with asking me for money but pointing out there was a descrepancy in billing no one would answer However , I went to the office and worked it all out - just a reminder to anyone having billing issues go in person - much faster and easier One star for the nurses and one for the embryologists, who were the only people at New Hope who would email me back whenever I had a question and who were helpful and pleasant during my visits If I only had to deal with them, I would give New Hope 5 stars For an event that is so emotional, stressful and costly, I expected to be treated more like a patient and less like cattleworst place ever people are not nice, I see so many folks going else where like a factory hereNew Hope was a great experience for me I can't recommend Dr Merhi more, he is wonderful! Plus New Hope has monitoring until 2pm which is super convenient Yes there can be long wait timesWe have been going to NHFC on the recommendation of a staff member at our prior clinic in NJ Yes, someone at another clinic actually told us, ""This place will never help you So we left our clinic because they refused to retrieve my eggs unless I had at least 3 viable ones At New Hope, they will work with you to get as far as you can with whatever you have to work with The staff over the past year has mainly been excellent It is factory-like there at times, but super efficient If you are stressed about money, it definitely does not help you on your journey to becoming a parentuntil our first ultrasound The baby was measuring small The intake nurse hugged me and told me this was the worst part of her Job These small touches really helped me get through it I considered for a moment changing clinics again since we are out of state, but honestly, why would I leave New Hope? They helped me achieve something I thought would be impossible, even if it didn't result in a baby This solidified my desire to be a mother, as I was somewhat ambivalent about it before undergoing this whole processMy son turns 2 next week and he is the love of my life  They have the best lab in the business and I would highly recommend them to anyone hoping to become a Mother Aside from knowledgeable doctors, technologists and other employees there, the office is huge and well maintainedGiving this place 1 star is actually one too many if there was a ZERO star functionality within YELP that is what I would give at this point!!! I am highly disgusted, disappointed, displeased,  and dismayed by the lack of responsiveness and and professionalism within this establishmentHIGHLY DISGUSTED!!!! (close this place down, do everyone a favor!)- oh I will be sharing this on FB so all of my same sex couples read about this place!After trying several other NYC fertility clinics where we had very negative experiences, we finally went to New Hope Our entire experience was greatThe care I received from this clinic was quite possibly the worst of my life While the facilities are clean and modern, the nurses and doctors don't treat people with any humanityEach time that I went for a blood test or sono, there was little human interaction with the nursing staff I have never been treated so poorly by a medical professional Try pretty much any other clinic Prior to coming to New Hope, I spent thousands of dollars at another clinic (Neway Fertility) with no results, and went on many initial consults with various other clinics I completely disagree with reviewers who say that New Hope feels impersonal - no, they have optimized their process so that they can serve all patients fast But they are professional, quick, and they know what they are doing  Additionally, Dr Zhang is in Castle Connoly Best Doctors and most important, his lab, embryologists and staff are top-notch   We loved the Columbus Circle facility- spacious, clean and amazing fish tank!  We were impressed with the doctors, nurses and staff and would highly recommend New Hope Fertility Center to any parent looking to seek professional, caring fertility treatment we all know this is not the only reason why a clinic is good or not, eveidently, so my reviewlwil be honest and accurate to help out people to understand pros and cons of this clinic (from my point of view) I think the medical work done was very good and professional and we got a healthy baby They also suggest to study the embryo befor transfring to the uterus, something also very important and professional, considering at this clinic you don't pay for the entire event, but step by step meaning, if the transfer doesn't have place they lose that part of th money Now,the thign is not very good at this clnic is communication and organization towards the patient th internal organization is not very precise, but not in terms of professional and medical outcome, but in terms of communication with the patient very few words and just obeying instructions The Center is a large facility that handles many different aspects of fertility; the doctors/nurses are all well-versed pro's at fertility and can probably do many procedures in their sleep on autopilot, but I needed a little more hand-holding and information on what was actually going on (Another issue is that they were ready to start my process immediately, but I wanted to wait a few more months; this got lost in communication between so many doctors/nurses so there was a stressful confusion of mismatched next-steps between them and meI am very impressed by the level of service quality provided at New Hope  And I am glad that New Hope didn't insist I had to repeat all those tests again like other places would have required (In my opinion, it wouldn't change the fact but only costs me extra money)  The service is phenomenon and very efficient  I work in the city, and I got in to New Hope at 7am and back to work before 8:30am in downtown, so the schedule works perfectly given how often you have to go back for the routine monitoringHe is very professional and very busyHis back office, specifically accounting/billing is the opposite They are not open to communication, totally unresponsive and sometimes plain rudeThey work of a voicemail Not even a nurse meets with you ITS A MONEY MACHINE It feels like a farm - you come in, your name appears, sees someone (not even a nurse) in 30 seconds and you are done I think this place has become a factory9 calls out of 10 would have no response and rest of one call would transfer me over to other office and then beeps come out then I leave my voice msg and no response ever againFeel like a very small, tiny Chinese restaurant with one employee takes million orders Even if I had no problem of my reproduction system, I would become infertile with stress while dealing with this placeHorrific experience with this office All these years later I feel my privacy violated knowing they have kept this after we fired them I have filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and I'm considering suing them I don't understand how people can be so cruel to patients BEWARE of this place, and if you have the means do yourself a favor and go to a reputable clinic attached to a proper medical center More than seven years after first finding this place  I'm still regretting ever walking through that door  I never felt as calm as I did at New Hope  Everyone from the front desk, to the nurse and finance department are so caring and welcoming None would ever compare to New Hope and the wonderful staffMy husband and I are immensely grateful to the doctors, nurses and administrative staff at NHFC! Dealing with infertility is an intensely draining and bewildering experience We really appreciated the clarity and efficiency of the New Hope system (the waiting room, with its WiFi, big windows overlooking Columbus Circle, soothing aquarium, and screens telling you where to go when your name is called during monitoring hours is an especially welcome change from other practices), as well as the friendliness and compassion of all of the staff She said she had tried other places and NH was by far the least impersonal, and the most efficient place First of all, their monitoring hours are until 2:00pm, which is a huge relieve if you work Different from other IVF places where the monitoring hours are usually up until 8 or 9 am  Second, I felt all the staffs to be warm and cordial Different from my previous IVF experience where all staff sounds angry and cold All their staff is very professional and friendly, in particular Tania and Maciej Additionally, the center has top notch equipment and great installationsI don't think the facility cares about its patient's complaints at all, especially its billing department One star is to its embryology lab, which is top notch However, this still doesn't merit going to New Hope if its other aspects are the worstI don't think a billing department like New Hope's can be any worse I tried contacting the billing department through emails and calls to discuss the billing issue, and was not called back after 2 months and numerous attempts to reach them They agreed to review my bill on the call, but then I continue getting bills from them and was then never able to get a hold of them I then wrote a complaint to Better Business Bureau and even them were not able to get in contact with New Hope  I signed up to join this study  Here is the complete text of the abstract that called them out for those false claims He seemed rushed and the billing department made numerous mistakes causing us a lot of un-needed hassle especially during a sensitive time This was extremely stressful and required quite a bit of energy to resolve This clinic may not refuse service to people but you have to ask yourself if it's really worth the trouble Thankfully I hired a fertility coach named Lin Weinberg who helped me find a better clinic amongst helping me increase my egg quality I do not recommend this clinic There are many other clinics where you can find success The 2nd issue is that NHFC no longer takes my insurance, so I have been paying out of pocket - and of course it's insanely expensive; exceptionally more expensive than my new center, and if there are hormonal issues, isn't it a moot point to go through with an IUI? Or are you just doing it so you can charge me for it willy nilly?  I really like the staff: nurses, front desk, bloodwork - but in 8 months, I have only seen Dr Zhang once for an initial consultation, and then some random doctors who performed the IUI - in & out (literally - haha) And no followup except via nurses, a quick call, or email Their systems are efficient; somewhat cattle call-ish, as they move you through fast and thoroughly, but their lack of personal interaction or empathy and care and individualized attention is disconcerting You are sure you've finally found the right place!  An answer to your prayers You will talk to the billing department You will call New Hope and get to a voicemail box for the nurses You will leave a message You will have a billing question and leave a voicemail for the billing department You will email the billing department You will wait DAYS AND DAYS for a response from ANYONE in this entire practice, and that response will NEVER come!! You will call again and again and leave message after message You will start making your email subject lines more urgent & you will be downright enraged that you are BEING IGNORED by the very people who led you to believe you were in good hands More time will pass  You will go online & you will post a scathing review of this incompetent group and you will warn others not to waste their precious time here!!You will hope that sharing your horrible experience will help at least one person!!!  If you are on the fence about going here, run far away, in the direction of a fertility clinic that backs up its promises and won't treat you like you don't exist!  For some reason the billing continues to be inconsistent and the follow-up is minimal, and that's me putting it very nicely  Just as I thought the billing process was beginning to work itself out, we have taken 10 steps backward away from progressEverything is good besides the billing department My INS denied one of my procedures in January, I never heard anything from the clinic and ended up having the procedure done in March After a lot of messages, I finally got the billing supervisor on the phoneNew Hope is a big, terrible assembly line But for all the tests we were taking, none of the doctors or nurses ever knew what any of it meantThe doctors, nurses and technicians are rushed, uncaring and clumsy - both with information and with equipmentWe went through a crisis while we were being treated there and their response was negligent and appalling This experience convinced us to cut our losses and leaveAll we want to do is forget our experience there, but on top of everything, we have been battling the billing department for a year nowStay far away from this awful placeNew Hope likes to advertise that they have helped women over 45 with IVF We would recommend using CHR in New York if you like personal attention and a friendly staff  My experience was horrendous  I felt like I was in some strange baby making factory where everyone was cold, rude, unprofessional and not helpful   We visited this clinic in May  We did the sonogram after our ""lecture""  When it was time to take blood, his ""nurse"" told us that everyone left for the day and there was no one available to take the blood  She told us to simply come back another day   What kind of place is this?  They actually charge you $150 when you need to speak to a doctor!   It's disgusting  The two were incredibly unprofessional and rude  in that ""this place should be shut down""  There are other places close by that DO NOT CHARGE you $150 to speak with the doctorCalled them , spoke to one Ms Corey, she transferred my call to another voice mailI have tried to come twice for a consultation on freezing my eggs--each time, I was early for my appointment time and each time, I waited over an hour to be seen, giving up at about 1 1/2 hours to get back to business The consultation and blood work is supposed to take only an hour, but your wait time to be seen will be MUCH longer The practice is very busy so there are times where patients may need to follow up aggressively and the nature of fertility treatment does require patience and managing expectations but overall I found the staff and quality of care to be excellentIf I tell you I know the business of IVF, this place is superior to any other IVF or fertility center in New York, among NYU, Columbia and others His service is reasonably priced and his staff is trained in customer service Although you may experience issues, they are truly interested in improving their business, based on complaints and feedback If you are deciding on fertility clinic, my advice is this is number one placeI can honestly say New Hope Fertility is God-sent fertility center I am so grateful that I found this clinic My first one I did was at NYU which worked but the heartbeat stopped at 6 weeks The billing team can be all over the place, but I will take it any day if this clinic gave me the most precious gift of life, my baby girl!!! I am also giving reviews of all doctors I have visited before finding New Hope in the last 2 years, as I want for somebody out there to also feel a joy of motherhoodthe wait was never long,the staff was remarkable they let me cry and encouraged me , they kept me informed of process and always called when they said they wouldI have had quite a positive experience at New Hope I've experienced the opposite at New Hope: a staff of dedicated Nurses, good med-techs, and YES doctors -- who care MORE & take the time The entire support staff is the most skilled and most broadly & specifically knowledgeable in the entire fertility process (not just cogs in a wheel) than all of the fertility staff in places I've been to in NYC  And New Hope is the MOST flexible in every respect, compared to all the other centers From scheduling retrievals throughout the day, to longer monitoring hours, etc When I think of the way I was treated by staff (including billing) at NYU, I am amazed how everyone there passed the buck and were so much less engaged than the team at New HopeNYU & CORNELL are FACTORIES  (Though at least Cornell's billing staff was helpful)  New Hope intentionally choses staff to minimize IVF patients' stress I've never had consistently better blood draws than at New Hope My draws at Cornell & NYU stunk in comparison Even the sonographers at New Hope seem to me a hundred times more thorough than the actual Doctor Fellows at NYU (who often additionally appear disengaged & perfunctory) (But the NYU guy can come across as vain and competitive with peers; and perenially one gets the impression he's doing you a big favor to speak with you The record-keeping at NYU is a JOKE compared to New Hope After charging $10,000 just to walk through NYU's door, most everyone at NYU condescends and they're not interested in gathering data to help learn for the next cycle But I've personally seen that this office has far more concern about people's wallets than other places Personally, I hope they never get too big, because it's the titanic clinics that serve themselves more than patients and can't easily shift their course due to their larger size    Overall I would say my experience was a positive one The receptionist was smiling and very knowledgeable  I was then seen soon after by a nurse for sonogram, blood work and even spoke with their billing department  Everyone was helpful and accommodating  Overall I would say it was a very pleasant experience  I have been to three different facilities in Manhattan  I also recommend to watch for your money  I also put a stop payment on my Am Ex  But they were MORE than happy to have me come in again and take my moneyMy next stop - the better business bureau  Just watch out HOWEVER, what will keep me from referring a friend to this clinic is the poor level of customer service you receive from the techs, billing, etc  It was nearly impossible to get a call back from the nurses when I had timely questions regarding medication days before a procedure (which actually came close to ruining one of my retrievals)  When you visit the office never expect to leave within an hour and a half  On billing, I have literally left 15 messages and multiple emails regarding charges that I wanted more color on over the the last two months to no response which I find just unacceptable  My sense is their patient count and overall program awareness has grown faster than they can keep up with and they don't have the appropriate staff in place to properly manage the inflowsit is a crazy place to suck your money from your pocket and they do not care any results, they treat women like a cow, do not believe when you first time meet with doctor john, he just wants your money by any means, a liar with a luxury lv bag, stupid money cheating business, they will 1 time a layer to remove your money from your wallet until you finish with your pay and then they will dump you to the street he made a fortune with cheating a good results as a promise of pregnancy he will slowly suck your blood from you until your money running out and you will get nothingMy experience so far has been very positive  I've been in for three appointments, and have been impressed with how organized the whole process has been  I have not had to wait very long  Maybe they are paying attention to their Yelp reviews?   I will update this review if my experience changes - but so far, the service and efficiency here has been really very good The nurses have been very helpful too Pros - They are less money than other places Their hours of monitoring and insemination are longer which considering average life of donor sperm is about 12 hours, if you're ovulating at midnight, you could do your insemination at 1pm - but they won't tell you this, you have to find out and ask when you think you're ovulating and work backwards and come in at 1pm on your own Pro and Con -they do a lot of monitoring which is good for precision, but after one iui and having my baseline, I didn't feel the need to come back on day 3, 8, 11 Staff is friendly but you have to hunt them down I was at RMA and the nurses sat down with me and told me everything, answered all of my questions and the doctor at RMA was available The embryology dept is very helpful and responsive  Don't rely on the front desk staff to get important info across (although they are nice)the bad thing about NH is that they don't turn anyone away i give one star for the sweet front desk and the embryology dept which is great you get passed around so no one really knows you - you are a just a number (he didn't) - i suspect he is a good doctor but just too overworked to pay attention to a patient","and then finally 2 rounds at NHFC, we are blessed with a beautiful baby girl The aquarium in the waiting area is so soothing! It's somewhat surreal The procedure was pain free thanks to a wonderful . This whole experience is turning into a nightmare I am a doctor and fully understand how a clinic should be run . My dentist closed down her clinic and donated all of her PPE to the nearest hospital . Half of the staff there are nice and courteous and helpful . The other half hate their jobs and take it out on the patients There was this one ultrasound tech who was rude, sullen, and dismissive for days until one of her colleagues had to apologize to me saying she was having a bad week . Most of the medical decisions are made by the nurses by some sort of protocol . Though I was very wary of coming here due to the negative comments, I decided to try it anyway because of their quality vs . I did one cycle/round of IVF and our dreams are coming true!! I know this sounds crazy but I am going to miss the staff! They were always so pleasant and positive and that kept me motivated . The staff is so kind and caring - the front desk remembers my name when I come in even though they are looking at hundreds of faces each day . After calling this office and speaking to the receptionist who then transferred my call to a Justine ROne star for the very nice nurses . In the meantime, I was to start bloodwork and monitoring . I am so thankful that I did because I found a clinic and doctor who have made the process so much easier by treating me like a human being . I am currently in my first IVF cycle and wish I wouldn't have waited so long after this awful experience at New HopeWe had a great experience at New Hope . This clinic just cares to take your money! We were told from that monitor to continue to take . NHFC is not working for us If you are getting good bad indifferent results, please PM me . The management of this clinic really sucks!The response you see from New Hope representatives is a perfect example of the misleading practices at this clinic . There was no consideration of my travel schedule at all . More importantly - It is a very easy out . to blame women's body's for the clinic's failures . I underwent a similar procedure in another state . The average clinic is able to retrieve (statistical averages) 70 % of the eggs . I've called 4 times in 3 weeks asking to just pay a bill and no one will call me back and I can never get anyone on the line! As for the service itself, DrZhang was very overzealous about getting me in to do IVF . All the services rendered were in June 2014 and included one doctors consultation and some minor lab work . New hope is a very professional clinic with very respectable nurses and staff . very nice and so are the doctors when you actually with them . I am highly disgusted, disappointed, displeased, . We loved the Columbus Circle facility- spacious, clean and amazing fish tank! . The service is phenomenon and very efficient . Or are you just doing it so you can charge me for it willy nilly? . I really like the staff: nurses, front desk, bloodwork - but in 8 months, I have only seen Dr Zhang once for an initial consultation, and then some random doctors who performed the IUI - in & out (literally - haha) And no followup except via nurses, a quick call, or email Their systems are efficient; somewhat cattle call-ish, as they move you through fast and thoroughly, but their lack of personal interaction or empathy and care and individualized attention is disconcerting You are sure you've finally found the right place! . You will call again and again and leave message after message You will start making your email subject lines more urgent & you will be downright enraged that you are BEING IGNORED by the very people who led you to believe you were in good hands More time will pass . I felt like I was in some strange baby making factory where everyone was cold, rude, unprofessional and not helpful . When it was time to take blood, his nurse told us that everyone left for the day and there was no one available to take the blood . She told us to simply come back another day . The two were incredibly unprofessional and rude . And New Hope is the MOST flexible in every respect, compared to all the other centers From scheduling retrievals throughout the day, to longer monitoring hours, etc When I think of the way I was treated by staff (including billing) at NYU, I am amazed how everyone there passed the buck and were so much less engaged than the team at New HopeNYU & CORNELL are FACTORIES . ( Though at least Cornell's billing staff was helpful) . Overall I would say my experience was a positive one The receptionist was smiling and very knowledgeable . I was then seen soon after by a nurse for sonogram, blood work and even spoke with their billing department . Overall I would say it was a very pleasant experience . But they were MORE than happy to have me come in again and take my moneyMy next stop - the better business bureau . Just watch out HOWEVER, what will keep me from referring a friend to this clinic is the poor level of customer service you receive from the techs, billing, etc . On billing, I have literally left 15 messages and multiple emails regarding charges that I wanted more color on over the the last two months to no response which I find just unacceptable . I've been in for three appointments, and have been impressed with how organized the whole process has been ."
11,New Hope Fertility Center,protocol," We got genetic testing done, blood work and another semen analysis for my husband, I got follicle monitoring done every week and bloodwork to check my levels and was told they wanted to begin with The IUI procedure 3 times before I went into IVF The IUI procedure was painless and they attempted two rounds per IUI After the first failed IUI I was broken I also got pregnant that round My egg retrieval took place today at 8:30a If you want to have an IVF experience that is not conventional but customized to your body only; this is your place I started to get worried about getting pregnant as it was determined I needed several hysteroscopies before being able to implant With Multiple attempts of ivf, surrogacy and my own transfers I was just so tired and unhappy So that's what I did transferred two embryos in June and here we are with a beautiful healthy baby girlI went there for an embryo transfer I was planning to have in the coming month I ended up doing two rounds of IVF because I had a very pushy and convincing nurse and doctor telling me my hormones level were good and I should try this month because I was ovulated Long story short I ovulated to early and they couldn't retrieve any eggs, so I went for another roundno the saline testshe doesn't know what she's talking about This was really shocking because I had been told I needed an HSG test to see if my tubes were blocked but they still wanted to move forward with it They said I was ovulating and to come in tomorrow morning to start What started out as an ""educational session"" turned into a full blown sales pitch for IVF treatments A couple of week's later I got a notice from her office to see when I can start a cycle quantity"" philosophy  I originally was going to do the IUI route, however, will now be doing IVFAll thanks to Dr Merhi and NHFC staff, I got a beautiful healthy​ baby girl at the ​age of 39 I've done a half dozen rounds at this point, so I've learned a few things about my body I'm a 36 year old woman, was born with only one fallopian tube, a polyp in my uterus that needed to be surgically removed, and a moderate to severe hereditary hormone imbalance I froze my eggs there and did Mini IVF Got 12 more embryos to go so you see they know what they're doing as far as process and most importantly I knew what they were doing each step of the way as well  UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE!!!!The twins are 15 months old and a complete joy!!! I can not express enough how overjoyed we are!! If I had to do it all over again I wouldn't change a thingI have been happy so far with my process We have one healthy embryo to transfer I am now 9 weeks pregnant at 45 with my own egg (after having been told by others that I would have go with ovo donation) Overall, I highly recommend and if we decide for a second child we will be using them again It's unfortunate The success of getting blast for embryos can be significantly lower in busier seasons, such as summer  Not pregnant so far  We did try donor eggs, had 20 embryos and transfers, but ended up in miscarriages one after the other After 6 months, we had egg retrieval and 4 frozen embryos  When it came to transfer, I insisted on having 2 embryos, though Dr Zhang suggested only 1 since I was 43 at the time and considered a high-risk case Where was a doc when I needed one? This was my last viable embryo   I am still in the process of undergoing procedures but I am hopeful I started there a year ago with follicle reaching the size of 15 a year later they couldn't detect not one He was very straightforward, and gave practical advice for our situation, which we followed and had a successful natural IUI at our first try! We were then ask to take clomid We took the birth control pills The following instructions were to take clomid and gonal  We were very stern - why are we taking these medications  Results - the follicles were lost  The recommended clomid intake was too high both times and it burned our follicles  At the first IVF at NHFC, I got one blastocyst and it gave us a hope  Though our journey was very long and difficult, the door at NHFC never closed,  Dr Zhang recommended mini IVFs with much less medications and my body and mind were peaceful and comfortable with cycles  I finally got the good blastocyst at 45 years old and transferred, got pregnant and had a baby at 46 years old I went with my husband for a consultation in the spring of 2018 and we decided to move forward with our IVF procedure a few months later, in the summer My husband and I had some difficulty during our process, as this is not a simple process to go through I also love that all their procedures are done in-house, from bloodwork, sonograms, embryo transfers, collecting sperm specimens, etc I am happy to report I am 10 weeks pregnant after my 1st embryo transfer then the problems started After a month of trying the Dr suggested the IVF which i didn't want to do Bc i truly believe in the ""old way"" to make babies since i only had PCOS Bc sadly they only want your money This is critical prior to retrieval or transfer I had nothing but success with Dr Merhi and I am so happy I decided to go with New Hope for my mini IVF cycle Previous ivf cycles had not rendered me any eggs We tried less medications (yay!) and a more gentle approach It took some banking but I eventually got myself a viable embryo Practice is willing to work with you and even do a retrieval if you only get one egg (which was the case for me on my one and only successful cycle - got one egg, PGS tested, and I'm now 29 weeks pregnant) I'm in the middle of 'egg retrieval process', just starting to stimulate my eggs  I was still on birth control when they scheduled the START of my cycle and made my first appointment while I was in London  This had nothing to do with timing my hormone cycles - they were controlling them with Birth Control  My cycle hadn't even started yet  If your cycle fails to produce your desired results, they will tell you it is because of your body  So that you can make an informed decision: My experience was not IVF  I was able to produce 14 follicles naturally (with proper stimulation, given my fertility history and hormone panels, I should have been able to produce considerably more with stimulation  Barring the failure to stimulate properly, at retrieval they only got 6 of those 14 eggs  It is in their interest that you have to do more than one cycle in this process, whether you are extending fertility or undergoing IVF to have a child - economically, they are not incentivized to produce a positive outcome on your first tryThey sent us an invoice for 350 USD saying this was a consultation, even though  we had not agreed to them calling us and had not agreed to these charges, and nothing medical was discussed I was able to freeze 22 eggs I was 39 at the time It was exactly the right approach, worked for us and we now we have a 1month old baby boy  I decided to pass on IVF and was naturally pregnant with a healthy baby 9 months later  They had me come in for a dose of a drug that would trigger ovulation without testing me for ovulatory disordersDr Merhi has been my primary doctor with my Mini IVF cycles and I couldn't be happier I got the best results with him as I am 9 weeks pregnant I started fertility treatments at NHFC in May 2015 with 2 cycles of IUI and 3 cycles of IVFmedicallawperspectives I froze my eggs as a preventative measure--- I was clueless about fertility, taking medication (I have never taken anything!), sonograms and retrievals I've actually never had surgery before either so I was dreading the retrieval However, I've gone back a few times to build my egg bank and I will continue to do so  There was a time when I forgot to re-order the medication on time (everything has to be taken at a specific time, on a specific day) When my ovarian count was down he put me on certain vitamins and medications that brought it back  When starting the IVF process when other doctors said that I should cancel my cycle due to lab work he corrected that faulty lab results by tweaking our medications  While it was a rocky road from beginning to end we finally were blessed with a successful pregnancy We had done a cycle at another fertility center before moving on to NHFC and there is no comparison! Dr Zhang introduced me to mini-ivf which involves not as many meds/injections as traditional ivf done at previous clinicThis is starting to be a bummer And much more gentle and even natural I started at NHFC in Janary 2015 at 44 years old I was still ovulating regularly His honesty was sobering, but we decided to proceed anyway with Mini IVF Imagine what they deal with there This past January, we transferred the two 3 day embryos we were able to get over the past year 12 days later, I had a positive pregnancy test On our third ultrasound, the baby had not grown and the heartbeat was slowing And most importantly we were finally successful! We had beautiful twins in April   Because of my age, we did not have success after a yearI had only 1 cycle of mini ivf with this clinic and the outcome was an healthy beautiful baby I insisted I wanted to try and the Dr, after explaining my chances were very low around 8%, suggested no invasive treatments, only some pills and just monitor very closely my cycle trying to get the best out of my excpetd only 1 or maximum 2 eggs (at this age they know you won't produce much, so it is common use not to prescribe much medicine) At th end of hte day, though fertile, I was anyways 43, so ivf was done for both reasons  I am almost 40 and conceived naturally with my first  So we decided to give it a try age, egg quality, other conditions  After reviewing my test results and considering my age, Dr Zhang recommended the best approach for me is to do 2 cycles of IUI before proceeding to IVF despite both my husband and I were ready to proceed with IVF right away  We decided to follow Dr Zhang's recommendation and proceed with IUI and I am now 13 weeks pregnant with the first IUIGood service until transfer  We were infuriated  I will strongly recommend not to use their service After three useless cycles (where they gave me the same 1st line medication that wasn't working), I went to another office which gave me the most advanced combination of three different medicines and I had a successful pregnancy But it was too late to try for another one after that birth  I knew my body was reacting to the medication and no one listened We had also worked with Dr Merhi previously and he remembered me as soon as I contacted him Just as an example, he prescribed me 1/3 the amount of hormones and injections I was taking at RMA, and the end result in the first cycle was the same I was getting at RMA I was able to retrieve 10 eggs, which was the average I retrieved at RMA, but with much less medication  If I knew all of these since the beginning, I would never had gone through 4 conventional IVF cycles at RMA We decided to go ahead and in the first cycle, we end up with 10 eggs retrieved and 2 healthy embryos Dr Zhang even told me that at my age, to be able to produce two healthy embryos was a very very good result He suggested implanting one embryo and last month I gave birth to a healthy baby I did one round of IVF, but ended up getting pregnant naturally after I had surgery We now have a happy and healthy baby boy  Turns out that they have published only 1 study on mini-IVF before, and they have funding to test whether mini-IVF works as well as regular IVF in a new group of patients  I was surprised to read that at the same time that they are studying whether mini-IVF works --- and it might, who knows? --- they are taking people's money to treat them with mini-IVF  The materials on their website say that mini-IVF works as well as regular IVF, and yet there really isn't evidence for that, something that they have been called out for in the medical literature (Gleicher N, Weghofer A, Barad DH  Low-intensity IVF: real progress?  Reprod Biomed Online  ""A recent publication in this journal strongly advocated low-intensity IVF (LI-IVF) after presenting the authors' experience with minimal ovarian stimulation (mini-IVF) However after being there for one cycle they quickly started pushing donor eggs   His salesmanship was poor    He pulled out charts and graphs that stated the percentages of healthy births with IVF vs   I agree with Jasmine R  My husband had done some research online and found New Hope and their Mini IVF protocol, which was attractive to us as we were convinced that pumping me full of drugs was inhibiting our chances of success  It didn't work right away, so Dr Zhang and his team worked with us to ""bank"" embryos in order to send them out for PGD testing  All of our embryos were normal, and we decided to go ahead and implant the healthiest of the bunch  That embryo resulted in our son, and we couldn't be more grateful They practice innovative methods of stimulating eggs to focus on quality rather than just quantity Instead of pumping you with tons of costly hormone shots to produce as many as eggs with swollen stomach and many bad sign effects, Dr Zhang and his staff customized their techniques based on each patientIn my 20's, I got pregnant but had an eptopic pregnancy Since then, I had 2 more and it was suggested to remove my right tube and do an invitro The 2nd one was at Cornell, which also worked but we found out the baby had down syndrome (due to my age now) at 10 weeks The 3rd one didn't work He suggested I do a mini IVF as I was over 40 and sometimes the high dosage of drugs can be very harsh on your body He also suggested I Freeze whatever embryo's go blastocyst, then test them first for any  problems chromosome before I transfer them back into me I had 7 and it turns out only 1 was normal I was very worried when they transferred it but they have an 85% success rate on normal embryo transfers One week later, I went in for my pregnancy test and It was positive!!! Today I am sitting with my 9 week old, healthy baby boy, Maceo Gael  Is Zhang a businessman? Yes They might tell you to take a drug (like a trigger shot), but then not even test for it the next day Or test all your hormone levels each time they monitor May we all have a healthy child of our own  I have to admit I was a little cautious after reading other comments here on Yelp  After 6 weeks, he finally decided to have a conversation with meFrankly, I am only working with them because they have 3 of my embryos''  No one asked my how my body felt with the embryo in me or wanted to discus the possibilities of why I did not end up getting pregnantI have done 2 iui's at nh on my way to do ivf - all with donor sperm  Do diligent research about mini ivf vs standard depending on your age and issue - don't just rely on them to tell you as there is conflicting reports about this out there","UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE!!!!The twins are 15 months old and a complete joy!!! I can not express enough how overjoyed we are!! We did try donor eggs, had 20 embryos and transfers, but ended up in miscarriages one after the other After 6 months, we had egg retrieval and 4 frozen embryos . We were very stern - why are we taking these medications . Though our journey was very long and difficult, the door at NHFC never closed, . I was still on birth control when they scheduled the START of my cycle and made my first appointment while I was in London . This had nothing to do with timing my hormone cycles - they were controlling them with Birth Control . If your cycle fails to produce your desired results, they will tell you it is because of your body . So that you can make an informed decision: My experience was not IVF . Barring the failure to stimulate properly, at retrieval they only got 6 of those 14 eggs . we had not agreed to them calling us and had not agreed to these charges, and nothing medical was discussed I was able to freeze 22 eggs I was 39 at the time It was exactly the right approach, worked for us and we now we have a 1month old baby boy . I decided to pass on IVF and was naturally pregnant with a healthy baby 9 months later . They had me come in for a dose of a drug that would trigger ovulation without testing me for ovulatory disordersDr Merhi has been my primary doctor with my Mini IVF cycles and I couldn't be happier I got the best results with him as I am 9 weeks pregnant I started fertility treatments at NHFC in May 2015 with 2 cycles of IUI and 3 cycles of IVFmedicallawperspectives I froze my eggs as a preventative measure--- I was clueless about fertility, taking medication (I have never taken anything!), sonograms and retrievals I've actually never had surgery before either so I was dreading the retrieval However, I've gone back a few times to build my egg bank and I will continue to do so . I am almost 40 and conceived naturally with my first . So we decided to give it a try age, egg quality, other conditions . After reviewing my test results and considering my age, Dr Zhang recommended the best approach for me is to do 2 cycles of IUI before proceeding to IVF despite both my husband and I were ready to proceed with IVF right away . We decided to follow Dr Zhang's recommendation and proceed with IUI and I am now 13 weeks pregnant with the first IUIGood service until transfer . Turns out that they have published only 1 study on mini-IVF before, and they have funding to test whether mini-IVF works as well as regular IVF in a new group of patients . they are taking people's money to treat them with mini-IVF . All of our embryos were normal, and we decided to go ahead and implant the healthiest of the bunch . Today I am sitting with my 9 week old, healthy baby boy, Maceo Gael . I have to admit I was a little cautious after reading other comments here on Yelp . No one asked my how my body felt with the embryo in me or wanted to discus the possibilities of why I did not end up getting pregnantI have done 2 iui's at nh on my way to do ivf - all with donor sperm . Do diligent research about mini ivf vs standard depending on your age and issue - don't just rely on them to tell you as there is conflicting reports about this out there"
12,New Hope Fertility Center,cost," They discussed the cost before even doing any work The only thing I that kind of broke my heart was the fact that my health insurance duped me and I'll have to pay all my expenses out of pocket They are so upfront and honest with you about each step and this includes billing It's your responsibility to inquire about the costs of things and to check your insurance to know what is your responsibility; not New Hope's   Please see the discourse I had with the billing manager I took this decision because oneI was also told that my insurance was covering IVF so why not and I could have a fresh embryo without taking any medication The next thing I know I was on different type of hormones and was pushed to accept a genetic testing that cost 750 and was not covered by the insurance What I did not know is that the cryopreservation was not covered either and costs 1250! I was never mentioned 1) the cryopreservation 2) the cost or even the eventuality it won't be covered She said not yet but everything should be covered except the testing They received the pre authorization 6 days after and the cryopreservation WAS NOT covered and I have know to pay out of pocket About billing department, I did not have a big issue or cost as I expected the cost as well as I got handout about the fee at the first consultation However, there are many hidden fees ( which were mostly covered by my insurance so no so big deal) is their billing department Their ineptitude has cost the company a lot of money And I'm covered under insurance! Their job should be to make it as easy as possible (and do everything they can to work with insurance) to get people in there I was hopeless and this was my 3rd fertility center, the other 2 my husband fired, but not before a few thousand dollars were spent in vain They also work with you regarding the NYS Infertility grant program  After my blood was taken, I was ushered to ""billing"" where I was asked to set up a payment plan for IVF I cannot imagine I spent my precious two years to do IVF here for many cycles Why?

No one could explain why to costs an additional charge when it was included in my consultation Called her again, was unprofessional with little information about cost, the procedure or anything  I am leaving again today with the hopes of finding a more professional place to spend $7,200 plus $1,200/year storage to freeze my eggs And charges much less for treatment . Their billing department is not there to help you understand your insurance . They are basically their to make sure you payand they will do everything they can to get every penny out of you"
13,New Hope Fertility Center,What went Wrong,Empty,Empty
14,NYU Langone Fertility Center,doctor,"This review comes perhaps after 19 years, as at the time there was no internet Today, I am grateful I ended up at NYU Fertility Center in the year 2000 with the best Doctor ever: Dr Licciardi (I just saw on their website he is still there and I know he is a great asset to NYU Fertility Center) Dr Licciardi was my doctor but I saw him only twice during the process We met at the consult and then he preformed one ultrasound I really thought Dr Licciardi's care was excellent during the process I definitely felt that he cared and I wasn't just another number in the factory I think Dr Licciardi wanted to manage my expectations because he told me to expect 10-14 eggs, but 22 were retrieved and 20 mature eggs were frozen (age 36)Dr Licciardi is an angel He changed my life! I emphatically recommend him!! Based on my extensive research, I learned that Dr Grifo is one of the most prominent IVF experts in the country and that he has had personal experience with IVF in his own family One of the most important things to look for is that the doctor studies your charts after each test and adjusts the medication and protocol accordingly to maximize your chances for a positive outcome Dr Grifo does exactly that He seems to know exactly what to do in more difficult situations like mine where the body doesn't react to the medicine quickly In the end, I had much better results than the first time at another clinic due to the above attention to detail and correct adjustments to the meds made along the wayI (40 year old) am holding my miracle child after 10 years of infertility and IF treatments (previous patient at Cornell and Columbia (stay far away from here!!!)Dr Berkeley took my rare case (less than 1% of his patients) and believed they could help meI've sent several friends to Dr Berkely with confidence and would send my sister (if I had one! ) to him She was prepared for our session, explained our options clearly, and was able to order the necessary tests to help us build our probe (that we eventually used for a successful pregnancy via IVF)Medical care was not satisfactory5, then went to 5, and then 7 Also did a saline sonogram here, and there were literally chunks of my cervix on the floor after because it took the Doc FOUR tries to get the speculum and catheter in properly Every phone/email interaction took no less than THREE tries  I was NOT disappointed!  In every step of the process, I was greeted with warm, friendly, attentive nurses and methodical doctorsWould recommend, would do again, and will definitely go to NYU for any future fertility care I may need in the future Initial consult w/ Dr Noyes  She was good at making me feel comfortable with the process She also smartly rejected my initial low AMH results (  Personally I didn't feel much the first 5 days of stims By the time they had me on ganirelix I did feel twinges in my abdomen and felt bloated  I also think a call at least once during the cycle from the doctor of your initial consult would help immensely to improve 'feel' However - my main goal was to go through this process in safe hands and I felt that was the case with NYU No effort to try anything They don't really care about your financial and don't listen when you point out their mistakesI really can't say anything positive  It's a factory  They ""explain"" things to you as if you work there and do all these things every day, but most of us do each of the things we need to do in this process one time and have no idea what NYU is talking about  But with very few (like one person) exceptions, they don't care about you at all  People who are ""coordinating"" things say things like, ""Did you tell so and so?"" And you're thinking ""I emailed every person with an email address, am I supposed to personally call every person whose name I've ever heard at NYU until I reach them after going through the switchboard? Isn't that, perhaps, your job? They are, of course, totally on top of billing - that part is always very clear and taken care of first and foremostI've heard bad things about Cornell (and nothing positive), so I wouldn't recommend them eitherDr Grifo is my phenomenal doctor who came highly recommended and has lived up to his word-of-mouthDr Noyes is also freaking amazing Number two: she has had a great sense of humor, a jovial, approachable manner, and a clear underlying focus on results whenever I've interacted with her Dr Noyes will cut through that insidious optimism and help you make statistically informed decisions I also highly recommend Dr Fino - another experienced straight shooter who will not BS you about what to expectAs for having a whole team of doctors available:  this is so much better than going back to the same person over and over again Although this procedure is elective, donors should be entitled to understand potential medical complications I do not feel confident that the health of donors is given enough consideration at NYU - there are other options in the city)I contacted our health plan's fertility nurse when my husband & I decided to conceive They care for pregnancies up to 10 weeks, so I figured I'd stick with them in case of miscarriage1/3 - First appointment, chatted with Dr Noyes, had a blood draw to confirm pregnancy (There are studies about behavioral problems in chicks and rats exposed to ultrasound in utero, so I'm trying to limit ultrasounds She said they didn't check because Dr Noyes ""doesn't believe in supplementing with progesterone"" to prevent miscarriage The doctor who performed the ultrasound was kind, said everything was normal, and we got to take pictures and a video of our baby's heartbeat""I later emailed Dr Noyes (she didn't respond) and called the office to clarifyWe went through several painful failed IVF rounds here And when we contact the billing center to discuss (more than 10 times at this point), they claim there is some secret ""Accounts Receivable"" person who makes all the decisions who we are not allowed to talk to directlyDr Licciardi is absolutely amazing Dr Licciardi listened to us carefully, provided his recommendations clearly and confidently, and ultimately helped us conceive our first baby in three months of treatment! I would recommend Dr Licciardi to anyone looking for a warm, knowledgable, caring support on the journey to conception I only met with Dr Noyes once during the process I had a friend help me with this process, but the Center should be able to provide more training and support at this point I recommended a friend to the Center who had a similar experience  When I spoke to others at the office, they kept telling me to call her  She finally called me back over a week later and told me she had been on vacation - apparently no one was covering for her and no one knew she was on vacation  As a patient, I've continued to experience this type of disorganization with each cycle  I felt like i was being jerked around  Just wish the rest of the experience was more pleasant and straight forward 1) You feel like you are in a vacuum But since they don't talk to each other, you are always told different story 2) My husband called 2 weeks prior (and I also wrote them an email) to confirm his appointment for providing his semen, and sure enough, they didn't have his name for that day All of that, it took them 45 minutes to figure out, and after he was told numerous times that he did not have an appointment  * I only spoke with Dr Berkley once on the initial visit  I felt that Dr Berkley was not involved in the decision making/ guidance after the initial visit  * I and the NYU staff was not able to communicate with Dr Berkley in regards to issue that were time sensitive* Overall while I am sure that Dr Berkley is an expert in the infertility treatment, I personally did not feel that his care was different/exceptional from other physicians and that NYU internal workflow/communication was the worst I have ever seen  This place is just EXTREMELY difficult to deal withNYU Fertility Center changed my life IVF is a very difficult process physically and emotionally, but the team at NYU is caring, knowledgeable and very well coordinated Dr Grifo was my doctor, and yes, while I didn't see him every cycle, he was always available by phone and my husband and I often set up calls with him to check in and he did design and adjust my meds with each cycle and day-to-day, especially towards the time of retrieval They are clear in their results and straightforward On my last day there I receive a warm goodbye and I felt cared for And pregnant, which I am deeply grateful to the team there for Twelve thumbs up for Dr Licciardi and his staff We couldn't be happier with the care we received there  In this consultation, he/she first reviews your medical history and talks you through it, and also provides a detailed overview of the process, and statistical chances of success  Before you leave, you get your egg count  My doctor was Dr Liccardi, who was very nice and knowledgable, and called me the day I started stims to make sure I was ok  I did at times wish I had a direct line to someone, but I realize they are busy treating patients and not sitting by the phone)  But overall, I'm extremely pleased with my experience and highly recommend NYU to anyone considering an egg freeze cycleI had a nightmarish experience at this center, and with Dr Grifo  I will add my two cents and will try to be as fair and intelligent as possible in my thoughts, because, if you are reading this, you are contemplating some big stuff in your life!Disclaimer: my partner and I did this electively - we froze our embryos - and we are not trying to conceive at this time   So I might have had higher expectations for this place, having not been in a situation where I felt that I had no other options) in her two main points: 1)  If you want results, you are as likely to get them here as anywhere else2)  They are NOT into giving ""more emotional type support to their clients""  I can say that Dr Grifo is awesome, too, because I had some contact with him also  Sometimes it felt like they were taking the ""care"" out of medical care  They really don't provide the support for the emotions that you will experience, or even the physical pain, so you have to find this support elsewhere   When I think about it, this is crazy to me, because, by all accounts, stress and anxiety are really bad for fertility, but they don't seem to give a crap about any stress or anxiety you are feeling  I think it will make you crazy to second-guess the doctors here, but hey, hormones make you do crazy things!  Anything having to do with making babies is an inexact science, that's just the way it is  It is also an emerging and changing field  They are way more focused on the next generation than on this oneI'm not a big poster, but I feel compelled to do so here - especially given some of these bad reviews They often remember you (not sure how when they see hundreds of patients), and I've never felt unwelcome or rushed My doc followed up on every procedure, and I knew she was available if needed Highly recommend!We are patients of Dr Grifo and couldn't have had a better experience and are sooo thankful for his expertise  We had several failed attempts to have a child in the state we live in  We went in for our first visit with Dr Grifo and, even though I had an incredibly large history file for him to review, he knew exactly what to try from day 1  Dr Grifo  is unbelievably brilliant, he gave us great advice along the way, he addressed all our questions and concerns, and their clinic is state-of-the-art in technical advancements  We are now expecting our first baby soon and couldn't say enough positive things about NYU and specifically Dr Grifo  Our first clinic was definitely giving more emotional type support to their clients, but that got us no where in the end I called the number on the statement to inquire about the additional $950, she tells me that there's no record of the $6950 payment My dr was DR Keefe, who spend some time with us during initial consultation, however it was very difficult to get a hold of him directly for any questions after that The doctor who ended up giving the ultrasound asked why I came in so late  When I finally spoke to my doctor, I felt like she was talking down to me despite the fact that I am a healthcare professional and this isn't my first IVF  I felt like she couldn't even be bothered with explaining her decision to me  The MDs do not seem invested in patient care","to him She was prepared for our session, explained our options clearly, and was able to order the necessary tests to help us build our probe (that we eventually used for a successful pregnancy via IVF)Medical care was not satisfactory5, then went to 5, and then 7 Also did a saline sonogram here, and there were literally chunks of my cervix on the floor after because it took the Doc FOUR tries to get the speculum and catheter in properly Every phone/email interaction took no less than THREE tries . They explain things to you as if you work there and do all these things every day, but most of us do each of the things we need to do in this process one time and have no idea what NYU is talking about . And you're thinking I emailed every person with an email address, am I supposed to personally call every person whose name I've ever heard at NYU until I reach them after going through the switchboard? She finally called me back over a week later and told me she had been on vacation - apparently no one was covering for her and no one knew she was on vacation . As a patient, I've continued to experience this type of disorganization with each cycle . I only spoke with Dr Berkley once on the initial visit . I and the NYU staff was not able to communicate with Dr Berkley in regards to issue that were time sensitive* Overall while I am sure that Dr Berkley is an expert in the infertility treatment, I personally did not feel that his care was different/exceptional from other physicians and that NYU internal workflow/communication was the worst I have ever seen . In this consultation, he/she first reviews your medical history and talks you through it, and also provides a detailed overview of the process, and statistical chances of success . Before you leave, you get your egg count . My doctor was Dr Liccardi, who was very nice and knowledgable, and called me the day I started stims to make sure I was ok . I did at times wish I had a direct line to someone, but I realize they are busy treating patients and not sitting by the phone) . They are NOT into giving more emotional type support to their clients . I can say that Dr Grifo is awesome, too, because I had some contact with him also . Sometimes it felt like they were taking the care out of medical care . When I think about it, this is crazy to me, because, by all accounts, stress and anxiety are really bad for fertility, but they don't seem to give a crap about any stress or anxiety you are feeling . Anything having to do with making babies is an inexact science, that's just the way it is . It is also an emerging and changing field . We went in for our first visit with Dr Grifo and, even though I had an incredibly large history file for him to review, he knew exactly what to try from day 1 . We are now expecting our first baby soon and couldn't say enough positive things about NYU and specifically Dr Grifo . I felt like she couldn't even be bothered with explaining her decision to me . The MDs do not seem invested in patient care"
15,NYU Langone Fertility Center,advice," Second, no one is going to hold your hand during the process I was cursing the center's name during my first injection as I felt that they could have done more to prepare me Third, your doctor may not do the actual retrieval All of the doctors are highly skilled with decades of experience so you will always be in great hands What this actually means I really don't know because Dr Licciardi made it clear that there are no guarantees You have to go into this knowing that you are going to drop thousands of dollars I initially was going to go to a less expensive center and then I thought is this really the time for me to be frugal??? These are your future children You owe it to your future self to go to the best provider Sixth, be realistic I'm doing this knowing that I have no control over the future outcome I have to be okay with the thought that nothing is guaranteed Do your research and be proactive, but love yourself no matter what happens He truly cares about his patients and wants the best for them Disappointed in those results, I researched other practices and doctors in NYC to try to have better results for my last cycle covered by insurance  I hope to go back for a sibling and hope that if you go here you walk away with your miracle Don't seem like a Doc even reviewed my cycle records until I asked Found out after the fact only a tiny 5 ft, 100 lb woman should be on a 2 Please note, it has never taken another Doc more than 1 try  I recommend bringing your SO (if you have one) so that you can do your paperwork together under supervision  The ultrasound was always done by a doctor (though not always *your* doctor) About the shots:  Mixing Menopur takes a lot more time than expected!  Prepare to spend ~20 min each night setting everything up and take extra precautions to ensure you are doing it right When you get there, it's a quick review of your medical history before setting you up on a surgical chair (w/ very high stirrups) Note - the retrieval doctor is unlikely to be *your* doctor (from the consult); fine by me, but some people may not realize this going in Recovery: Once you have demonstrated your vitals are ok and you can use the bathroom on your own they send you out with a few docs about what to do/not to do and look for over the next week You are also told your egg count (mine was 12) I suspect that this is the norm and so want to emphasize it since most boards are filled with negative experiences I would have been pleased with this, except that they needed to use ICSI for fertilization  Instead, we ended up spending a LOT of money on ICSI, and also being concerned /frustrated that we had to choose among a poor sperm sample  That was the most important part for me Just see that you are above 40 and tell you that your only hope is to use donor eggs I would advise anyone above 40 (women) NOT to pursue treatment here This was told to me by 2 separate providers in this same practice Or else never would I choose to work with these physicians Many of the rest don't even have direct phone numbers - so it is sort of a ridiculous joke trying to reach people at various critical stages  Maybe try CCRM?  Or get out of New York if you can  I was annoyed when I realized this, but I can't say I was surprised Dr Leeds was my doctor and was honest with me about the chances for success and limits to the procedure This demonstrates to me that they did their job well Still no certainties what will happen, but they skills gave me the best chance possibleAsk questions and do your research intelligently: The NY Department of Health guidebook for egg donors mentioned by another reviewer is already 20 years old (1998!) and hasn't been updated since Look instead at the most recent literature from the medical community and to sources you can trust for expert and accurate advice Research is ongoing, so they freeze the immature eggs in hopes that fertility science has had some breakthroughs by the time the eggs are thawed for use Still, it's important to keep in mind that this process is basically a scientific miracle Having a child genetically related to oneself following cancer or into one's 40s is a triumph of technology over the harsher side of nature I am impressed with his intellect and dedication to continuing research in fertility This guy does not quit He is exactly who you want on your make-a-baby team I read on here that maybe she isn't always warm and fuzzy Number 1: Who cares!? She is a scientist and surgeon, not a therapist I was laughing and talking about gelato as I waited for the anesthesia to kick in Then I had an effortless, painless recovery Dr Noyes is rigorous, meticulous, courageously honest about what patients can expect and should do, and dedicated to high performance standards Note:  Dr Noyes is the most statistically oriented of the doctors with whom I've interacted If you are a logical, statistical thinker, you will get sick of all the anecdotal and narrative evidence batted around in fertility forums and between moms The way this clinic is set this up, patients have access to second, third, and fourth opinions during their cycles Empower yourselves and use the team of doctors to your advantage Way better than reading fertility forums which tend to be overly optimistic This is when I myself started to get concerned Consider where you go carefully - your health matters, too This was the first I'd heard of this I asked her to re-do it in a sanitary way, as I've developed infections from ultrasounds previously1/22 - Called to get my test results from 1/20 (Idk how this is possible because I caught chickenpox and had two MMR vaccines""Me: ""Ok, so I guess I should have this baby and get the vaccines right after and then I won't be getting pregnant within 30 days?""Nurse: ""Well you need to get the vaccine before you get pregnant, so you don't want to wait I won't be going back, as the potential for great medical error with this system is alarming Why not?! So bizarre His warmth and understanding put us at ease right awayMy experience with Yelp reviews is that they are mostly either excellent or disastrous, and so I am writing to give a more nuanced picture There was a training session to explain the egg freezing process and ask questions, as all the language around different hormones and cycles can be overwhelmingI think the doctors are top-notch here and they are worth coming here for, but the support staff needs reorganization  Several months ago, I was told that I had to speak with a particular person at billing before I had a procedure Others I've spoken with have also experienced itDespite this, I think my doctor is great They in the end explained how the lab was not ready that day, and they didn't know till that morning 4) They told me that I need to book an appointment with Dr Berkley to complain about all of the above  You have to constantly follow-up  This was over six months ago and we are still trying to resolve it  Such a shame they can't treat their patients better  I'd look for other options Yes they don't hold your hand but they really deliver  (This is a long review, but I wanted to describe the whole experience  Then you do an initial consultation with the doctor you chose  Then, he/she does an examination to make sure everything looks in order down there)  After that, you're ready to start whenever you're ready  This is the amount extracted, diagram of the female reproductive system), with the most relevant info (dos and don'ts) kind of mixed in easy to forget I had repeated failed cycles here, and questioned their earlier representations to me I found Dr Grifo's behavior to be unprofessional and beneath the standards I would expect for a physician - despite the fact that he delayed my procedure due to their on-the-spot demands for money - he had the gall and distaste to say to me that he could have made $3,000 during the time he was speaking to me I found the experience traumatic and, as mentioned earlier, repeated cycles were entirely unsuccessfulWe had Dr Keefe, and he is awesome  One of the best doctors I've ever worked with  He made an immediate connection with us and I really value that  But unfortunately, you spend very little of your time here with your doc  If I had once piece of feedback for this place, it would be to please only hire people with a decent bedside manner, especially those who work directly with patients  I wanted to tattoo my name and date of birth on my forehead, from getting asked so many times  My other negative is that they really just don't prepare you for the enormity of what you are going through  (I suggest hooking up with someone who has been through it before and putting them on speed-dial on your phone)  Nobody will ever simply ask you how you are feeling  I overheard a couple other ladies questioning their medicine doses and the timing of their procedures, and I just would caution against going down that road  But I believe that this place has the most data, the most information, to base their decisions on  There may be students in some of your appointments  (I'm all for it because it will help future couples conceive, but if you don't want a student in there, just speak up and say so  They are tiny now  Try not to over-worry this partThe other ""good"" thing, if you can call it that, is that the procedure, which I spent a lot of time dreading, it no bigs either  They put you in what they call, and I am not kidding, ""twilight sedation"", which is great  The anesthesiologist stays with you the whole time  The sedation is awesomeSo, the bottom line for me is: this is a results-oriented medical clinic that will not hold your hand through any of this  Which is, after all, their joband I now know whythis is especially impressive since everyone else had no idea how to proceed  When you go to the best of the best, you DO get different results  Let them do what they do best  They work with Walgreens and Livestrong to get you all of your hormones free of charge Figure out a better system because this is unfair to your patients I don't remember what Doctor handled our implantation- but she was fantastic In the end the doctors and nurses all know what they are doing and you can trust them - but the communication is lacking and frustrating for a patient who has never gone through fertility treatment before Maybe a smaller facility will be more hands on but have less caregivers which may cause other issues In the end we are happy with our IVF baby girl and it was worth any aggravation we had at the time  The first problem occurred when the secretary gave me the wrong appointment time and date  It was in her handwriting, so she knew she wrote it wrong and all she could do was apologize profusely  Ultimately, I decided not to have my procedure done here, because I don't trust them at all The doctors are amazing, and very approachable Everything is digital, and everyone is on board at all times In particular, we loved Dr Keefe  They seem to be just coasting through the process The entire process was disappointing","These are your future children You owe it to your future self to go to the best provider Sixth, be realistic I'm doing this knowing that I have no control over the future outcome I have to be okay with the thought that nothing is guaranteed Do your research and be proactive, but love yourself no matter what happens He truly cares about his patients and wants the best for them Disappointed in those results, I researched other practices and doctors in NYC to try to have better results for my last cycle covered by insurance .

16,NYU Langone Fertility Center,nurse," I also remember a very caring and nice nurse, I am not sure I am spelling her name properly: Nurse Oana (I think she was from Romania or an Eastern European country, not sure) anyway, all the nurses were very supportive during this emotional journey He was always accessible by phone and email, and he called me several times to keep me updated and to check on me He is compassionate, smart, caring, available, etc She was responsive, knowledgeable and easy to work with They kept saying they were sent via mail, but after me calling every week for over a month the admin realized the folder had been sitting on a desk but never picked up Meet patient coordinator:  She was supposed to be my main point of contact over the next few weeks, though after paperwork/insurance was handled, I never spoke with her again  Monitoring also makes you feel like you're in a spy movie; every day you are told to ""await a phone call with further instructions Examples: Few of them have email address (at least that they will provide) The same nurse (I think) said that nurses don't look at patients' records when they call with test results Unfortunately, it seems that the staff does not communicate very well The give clear, individualized instructions and are available to answer questions The nurses are caring and compassionate and the embryology team is very good  The next day, a nurse calls you and tells you how many of those were able to be freezed, and of those, how many are mature They were beyond rude and horrendous to me If you have an emergency, leave a message via the call center and someone gets back you right away Phone calls post-testing or procedure have always been timely, and they make sure you understand all instructions He's truly sweet and honestly caring, on top of being an amazing expert He was open to trying new things, and answered every question I sent, at any time of dayThe nurses gossip about the MDs constantly","She was supposed to be my main point of contact over the next few weeks, though after paperwork/insurance was handled, I never spoke with her again .

17,NYU Langone Fertility Center,clinic," They have a great team and I have to thank them for having given me the most precious gift I have: my daughter Life Is full of surprises as now 19 years after, my daughter is a freshman at NYU! I had an excellent experience, but I can see why some people may have complaints Here are a few points to consider:First, it is a factory but an organized one Actually, it gave me comfort to know that the center is a well oiled machine  You may see the same nurses during blood work, but often they are different They were all excellent Get there at 7 am to avoid the wait for blood work I felt completely unprepared when it was time to do my first injection I read the directions and then watched the videos It probably took me an hour to do my first two injections Fast forward to Day 4, I was a pro at administering the injections (less than 10 minutes)Fourth, you will get excellent results My insurer was giving me the runaround and I couldn't wait any longer What is meant to be will beI am happy to say that I had a good experience with Dr Grifo at NYU and much better results than at another clinic (which I also reviewed) Be aware!I also encountered issues with NYU's and specifically the anesthesiology department's billing practices  I loved the whole clinic - minus a nurse or two- but on the whole- have loved my experience with them- ans again- this wasn't my first time aroundlike any Infertility clinic- it gets busy- but never felt like the cattle call at CornellGenetic counselor, Andria was the only bright spot at this clinic (have been to 3 clinics at this point)Administrative support here was probably the worst part of this clinic Was frustrating to schedule appointments and get questions answered by the nurses When it got sent to me, more than half of the records were missing, but luckily the few items I needed where there   You will feel like a product on an assembly line, but that's a good thing; you'll get the impression that NYU has done this many, many times before The morning visits were smooth and calm It was my first time going under anesthesia, and I was terrified--but the whole thing ended up being just as efficient as the rest of my care at NYU  I am now one day post-op and have no pain at allExperience at NYU Fertility Center in May 2018; I was 353 Orientation:  This provided useful information on how everything would proceed Process begins!  You show up for monitoring (blood draw + ultrasound) on day 2 of your period  Monitoring is something you'll be doing a lot of; it's quick (~20 min), and then you are on your way (maybe leading to the factory feel that some have reported, but I liked the expediency)About monitoring:  I felt like the nurses were great, caring and competent""  Later, the call comes with info about how much medication to take  For me, recovery wasn't bad I did not accept Tylenol and felt like I had very bad cramps for the rest of the day but they improved by day 2  Apparently, my husband's sperm (which he provided a few weeks earlier and looked 'great' at the time) - did not come out of frozen in a good state  I was *extremely* frustrated by this and consider it a huge fault of NYU that they did not inform us of this possibility (there was ample time for my husband to come back to provide more specimens) Overall I would consider the experience generally positive due to the quality of people at NYU and feeling in safe hands  On the negative side: the front office is extremely disorganized (don't discount other reviews about this; be vigilant about your paperwork and double check everything!) Recommendations for NYU:  I think the biggest issue for NYU in terms of 'feel' is the lack of a single point of contact for your cycle  I assumed the patient coordinator would be that, but I didn't interact with her again once I started my cycle  If they could somehow ensure a single, constant person greeted you each day for monitoring and later called you with instructions, it might feel a bit more personalizedTerrible billing system Very terrible billing system  They treat you like nameless, faceless cattle because that is what you are to them  They make an already very stressful process really more as stressful as possible and they just don't seem to care  So, it's pretty clear what they really care about I think it's hard to find someone in New York who doesn't just care about the money and know there will also be lots of patients in the pipeline, even if they get some bad reviewsI am writing this review 5 years after having my eggs frozen at NYU I just thawed and fertilized the eggs (at a different facility as I have moved) and had higher than average success rates The NYU clinic is associated with one of the best research universities in the world after all They do need improvement in some areas but are unlike commercial clinics that might look fancier but are exclusively for-profit My retrievals consistently went up under his careful monitoring and I didn't even do the acupuncture or yoga (Seriously, who has time for all these appointments, having a professional job to pay for this, plus time for yoga classes and acupuncture?)From a donor perspective: make sure to do your research! This was a great resource for me, straight from the New York Department of Health: healthOne of the nurses (there are three) was troubled by my questions related to potential medical risks for donors, and expressed this I'll update as those bills come in I found out I was pregnant a couple days before my appointment at NYU It was too late to cancel without financial penalty, so I went anyway They took blood for genetic carrier screening and many other things they didn't tell me about beforehand I wish they'd told me which tests they were running, since many were repeats of tests I'd had done recently and have records for The nurse called me same-day with my hCG level and said to come back in 2 days for a repeat to confirm my levels were doubling They told me to come back the following week for another blood draw I was confused because I'd initially been told I'd just need the first and 48-hour tests, but the nurse said it was necessary to confirm things were moving successfully 1/10 - Went back for another draw, got a call same-day from a nurse She said I had to return in a week for an ultrasound, although it would be too early to see a heartbeat, and I'd need another ultrasound the next week to look for a heartbeat) I said I'd prefer to wait until I was far enough to find a heartbeat, so I could just have one ultrasound instead of two)1/20 - Had a blood draw and transvaginal ultrasound The nurse didn't wash her hands or use gloves to prep the ultrasound probe (and she touched door knobs and a trash can) She said we still needed a repeat ultrasound in a week, but didn't clarify why The nurse said my blood from 1/20 wasn't run since the doctor saw what she needed on the ultrasound I wish they'd waited until after the ultrasound, so I could have avoided an unnecessary blood draw and bruised arm The nurse gave me the results from an earlier blood test that I hadn't received before My titers were checked a few years ago when I volunteered in a hospital and came back showing immunity) But anyway, the nurse said I needed to get the MMR and varicella vaccines ASAP and wait 30 days to get pregnant (Those are LIVE vaccines which are NOT given during pregnancy!)Nurse: ""You need to go to a clinic to get the MMR and chickenpox vaccines Just wait 30 days to get pregnant""Me: ""Ok well it's too late for that now, and I can't get the vaccines because I'm pregnant""Nurse: ""If you're not going to follow our advice to get the vaccine, you'll need to sign a waiver saying you understand the risks There's also no online portal to check your own labs This place is a mill, they treat you like cattle But this is not even my main complaint The invoices are jibberish, but they keep sending them to us Every time we receive a bill it is like PTSD about our past failed cycles NYU Fertility Center is inhumane and really unpleasant to deal with I froze my eggs with NYU in 2012 and it was totally fine It was well organized and although there are a lot of people handling you and your visits, I felt they were competent and everything was done professionally The most difficult part of the process is the first time you come home with all the prescriptions and needles and you have to inject yourself for the first timeThe nurses are good at responding to voicemails, but their response is always to tell you to speak with billing  Their default start of conversation is always to ask ""did you speak with billing?""  I've learned that if you press them, sometimes they will actually  look in your chart and see that there really is no need to speak with billingAnd I've found that billing only returns calls about 1 out of 4 times  I left message after message  When the woman from NYU returned from vacation and returned my call, she became upset with me because I had spoken to someone else in her department in billing!  It was really quite odd But, If I had waited, I would have missed that month's window  I've at various times waited two hours to be seen during morning monitoring - and double checked to see if my name had been called - have been told no, it hadn't, and then upon seeing the nurse, have been told that i was called earlier   It's very stressful  I was previously tested at another place and that should have been enough When i called Recombine, they told me they could reduce the payment, but refused to issue a new bill for me stating thisI agree with the others regarding doctors/nurses not giving much attention to you or your future Dr Berkeley will talk to you on the first day (and that's it), and after that, you will most likely only communicate with either nurses, coordinators, billing department, more nurses, and a 'day of' doctor payment plan, timing, your chart and what's missing, etc But, when I got the PGS result, I then was told (by a different nurse) that it was too late to take the pill now as I should have taken in on day 2 of the previous month But, they don't realize that the phone tag play is pretty awful I guarantee that they will not pick up your call (no matter which number you call), and you leave a vm, and if you ever miss their callback, good luck because when you call back, that will go to vm againBelow is the brief summary of our experience with NYU  * Terrible internal communication between the NYU staff (physicians and nurses) as I was repeatedly told erroneous or conflicting information/guidanceGreat Doctors, but HORRIBLE customer service  The Doctors are amazing, but the customer service and billing/administration is so bad I would just go someplace else if I had to do it all over again  When you call you NEVER get the actual folks at NYU Fertility, it just goes to an answering service over and over again  The service says someone will call you back within 3 hours and that never, ever happensWe've been around the block to different centers, and the people here are the absolute top Kind, helpful, compassionate, human Thank you, NYUI've recently did my first ever IVF cycle at NYU and my experience was really great! Nurses and staff were really efficient, straight to the point and nice I was dreading ER but my experience in OR was great! No pain after and nurses were very comforting when I woke up Overall the whole process was very smooth and much easier than I originally expected NYU has a great team of doctors, nurses, embryologists - I was really impressed)  Overall, I thought NYU was efficient and professional, and I'm very pleased with my experience  After that, you sign up for one of their egg freeze ""orientations,"" which is a 2-3 hour presentation by a nurse about the details of the process (this was probably the weakest link in the experience, more on that below  (I ended up waiting a year, but didn't have to redo the consult)  You pick a pharmacy (I highly recommend Apthorp -- they deliver!), and NYU will call in your prescriptions  This was no issue as Apthorp will deliver same day, even when you call late afternoon  You go in for bloodwork on your day 2, and then that afternoon, if you're bloodwork is solid, you're cleared to start meds and they'll tell you exactly what to take and when, and when to come back into the office  (It's usually in 1-2 days, always in the mornings between 7-9 am)  Every morning you go in, they do bloodwork, and most often they will do an ultrasound also to check how you are responding to the stims  Then, that afternoon, a nurse will call you, give you your estrogen levels, and give you instructions on what to take for then next few days and when to come back  The nurse will call and tell you precisely when to take the trigger shot, as your procedure in the OR will be timed exactly to this time  The day of the retrieval, plan to spend 3 hours at the place -- an hour to change/talk to the anesthesiologist/wait around, 10-15 minutes for the procedure, and about 45 mins to an hour of recovery, where they give you water and crackers, and maybe pain meds if you need them for cramps  Overall, I was very pleased with the experience  It's true that you don't see the doctor much, if at all, after your initial consult, but I really did not mind as every doctor I saw (they rotate in the mornings to do the ultrasounds) was very competent and nice and I never felt that I was not in good hands  In the mornings when I went in, I would usually arrive around 8 am, and I rarely had to wait more than 5-10 minutes  And the whole thing would take no more than 20/25 mins if we did an ultrasound, and 5-10 if it was bloodwork only  There is definitely a ""factory"" feel to the process, and sometimes you feel guilty holding up the process by asking questions (they just move that fast), but I actually overall appreciated that quality, because it made the entire experience very efficient and not much of an intrusion into my daily routine  If you have questions in the process, you call the nurse's hotline and someone will call you back within 2-3 hours  In terms of areas for improvement, my only complaint would be the orientation process I thought it was long and drawn out and filled with a lot of useless info (e  Also, the nurse that did our orientation (both times -- I attended twice since I waited so long) was a bit strange and I thought somewhat inappropriate, but most importantly, long-winded and slow, making it an unhelpful 3 hours of my workday  I think the orientation should be shortened by half with the emphasis on 1) do's and don't's during the cycle; and 2) a quick demonstration of how to administer the shots (not an endless one, as I experienced, since there are videos online But, more so, their billing felt incredibly disorganized I was perplexed because days earlier I didn't have a balance at all and confirmed that my insurance still had not reached its cap for fertility treatments I have never experienced a more callous, money-hungry experience as a patient and would never return to this clinic againI am surprised to see so few reviews here of this clinic  You will be making regular visits, and it is the rest of the staff that you will be working with, and you will be super hormone'd up and extra sensitive, to boot  I had a few bad experiences with the staff, especially this super mean lady in the recovery room, OF ALL PLACES (when you are waking up from the anesthesia, from your procedure)  -- dang!  She was just super gruff and mean, and at one point just walked away while I was sitting alone and crying, during my intake for the procedure, when I was anxious and scared  Also, you feel a little bit like cattle, going through the processThe good stuff is: they know what they are doing, and I believe they are actually one of the clinics who helped make this whole field in the first place)Another ""good"" thing, if you can call it that, is that the injections that you give yourself - that you will dread - are really no bigs!  You can just watch the training videos a bunch of times til you feel comfortable doing it (that's what I did)  Needles have come a LONG way  It is all the stuff Michael Jackson was into :)  My recovery was also no bigs at all - can't say that I had any issues with thatI had the best experience here! I love the team and everything went so smoothly! I highly recommend you go to NYU you will not regret it I honestly cannot say enough about my experience here My doctor is amazing (Hodes-Wertz), the other docs I've interacted with are friendly and knowledgable,  and the nurses absolutely make the place Everyone here is efficient and kind Yes, you may not see your actual doc often - that's how it works at all fertility clinics They are very organized and know exactly where you are/what you need in every cycle Not only am I confident they are doing everything I need medically, but I feel genuinely cared for by nursing staff when I'm there  We didnt give up, but a few months later, our in-state fertility clinic dropped us after the 5th IVF because they couldn't figure out what was wrong   We decided to travel to New York and try NYU because they have one of the highest success rates in the worldTo anyone considering using NYU, keep in mind that the NYU team isn't there for emotional support  NYU is the best at what they dohelp give you the greatest gift of lifeThank you to the entire NYU team for not giving up on us when everyone else did!  We are very thankfulAll and all my experience at this facility was mediocre But the doctors don't really pay you much attention, literally running from room to room every morning My biggest issue with this place is billing, they can't get there act together Puts me on hold, she than comes back to say that I need to call the NYU fertility office and have them release the $950 to be paid to the anesthesiologist So I called the NYU fertility billing office, of course they leave a voicemail at 5pm when they close She states that the $950 is extra and told me to call another department He was inaccessible and his secretary at the time was new and not helpful Apparently he is only part time at NYU and also has another practice We would have an appointment with him regarding the IVF and it would get cancelled last minute and we had a first ultrasound appointment of fetus scheduled with him that also got cancelled The secretary did not inform us we should schedule the ultrasound appointment with any of the doctors so we waited and then found out we should do that and it was week 8 The nurses are helpful, especially Carol and Andrea and will answer your questions and call you back But they are busy and sometimes it takes a full day for them to get back to you which is nerve wracking when dealing with self administered scheduled shots  We had some miscommunication with billing and our insurance which also was frustrating leaving the patient in the middle to sort it out Billing does not call you back unless you hound them I've heard other places are similar- ie feels like a factory- so I'm not sure if this is standard for large hospitals that have good reputation for fertility treatmentSTAY AWAY FROM NYU! Horrible facility  The bigger problem was billing  My labs were sent to two different lab facilities on the same day and I was charged two co-pays, but nobody knew why they were sent to two facilities and why I was charged twice  I was not confident in my physician, I was not confident in her staff and I was not confident in the billing  I have been to many different places and I have never seen a more disorganized placeThis is an excellent fertility center We did 4 IVF cycles at Columbia, had consultations and Cornell and at New Hope, and then found NYU NYU was sooooo much better than any of the above The place is super-organized, morning monitoring is really efficient and quick (unlike, say, Columbia) Wouldn't send my friends/relatives any place else!  In the recovery room after the retrieval procedure, the nurses were making fun of on of the patient's who was experiencing hallucinations after the anesthesia  The weekend nurses had made multiple mistakes regarding when I come in and when I take my medication","They have a great team and I have to thank them for having given me the most precious gift I have: my daughter Life Is full of surprises as now 19 years after, my daughter is a freshman at NYU! I am now one day post-op and have no pain at allExperience at NYU Fertility Center in May 2018; I was 353 Orientation: . This provided useful information on how everything would proceed Process begins! . I felt like the nurses were great, caring and competent . Later, the call comes with info about how much medication to take . For me, recovery wasn't bad I did not accept Tylenol and felt like I had very bad cramps for the rest of the day but they improved by day 2 . On the negative side: the front office is extremely disorganized (don't discount other reviews about this; be vigilant about your paperwork and double check everything!) They treat you like nameless, faceless cattle because that is what you are to them . They make an already very stressful process really more as stressful as possible and they just don't seem to care . Their default start of conversation is always to ask did you speak with billing? . I've learned that if you press them, sometimes they will actually . When the woman from NYU returned from vacation and returned my call, she became upset with me because I had spoken to someone else in her department in billing! . It was really quite odd But, If I had waited, I would have missed that month's window . I've at various times waited two hours to be seen during morning monitoring - and double checked to see if my name had been called - have been told no, it hadn't, and then upon seeing the nurse, have been told that i was called earlier . When you call you NEVER get the actual folks at NYU Fertility, it just goes to an answering service over and over again . Overall, I thought NYU was efficient and professional, and I'm very pleased with my experience . I ended up waiting a year, but didn't have to redo the consult) . You pick a pharmacy (I highly recommend Apthorp -- they deliver!), and NYU will call in your prescriptions . This was no issue as Apthorp will deliver same day, even when you call late afternoon . It's usually in 1-2 days, always in the mornings between 7-9 am) . Overall, I was very pleased with the experience . In the mornings when I went in, I would usually arrive around 8 am, and I rarely had to wait more than 5-10 minutes . There is definitely a factory feel to the process, and sometimes you feel guilty holding up the process by asking questions (they just move that fast), but I actually overall appreciated that quality, because it made the entire experience very efficient and not much of an intrusion into my daily routine . In terms of areas for improvement, my only complaint would be the orientation process I thought it was long and drawn out and filled with a lot of useless info (e . You will be making regular visits, and it is the rest of the staff that you will be working with, and you will be super hormone'd up and extra sensitive, to boot . I had a few bad experiences with the staff, especially this super mean lady in the recovery room, OF ALL PLACES (when you are waking up from the anesthesia, from your procedure) . -- It is all the stuff Michael Jackson was into :) . My recovery was also no bigs at all - can't say that I had any issues with thatI had the best experience here! We decided to travel to New York and try NYU because they have one of the highest success rates in the worldTo anyone considering using NYU, keep in mind that the NYU team isn't there for emotional support . NYU is the best at what they dohelp give you the greatest gift of lifeThank you to the entire NYU team for not giving up on us when everyone else did! . I was not confident in my physician, I was not confident in her staff and I was not confident in the billing . I have been to many different places and I have never seen a more disorganized placeThis is an excellent fertility center We did 4 IVF cycles at Columbia, had consultations and Cornell and at New Hope, and then found NYU NYU was sooooo much better than any of the above The place is super-organized, morning monitoring is really efficient and quick (unlike, say, Columbia) Wouldn't send my friends/relatives any place else! . The weekend nurses had made multiple mistakes regarding when I come in and when I take my medication"
18,NYU Langone Fertility Center,protocol,"I decided on NYU after doing a lot of research on egg freezing Egg quality is a mystery until you make embryos I'm going to do another cycle because more eggs = higher percentage of a positive outcome Other clinics often make you follow a generic protocol and shrug when you don't get results even though they should know that every body reacts differently to the medicine And they ask for $500 to give you your own eggs if you decide to transfer them elsewhere  We did two rounds of IVF and we able to get my daughter Did 3 letrozole cycles here, and had to ask after every failure to up my dosage (started at 2 When we decided to go somewhere else for IVF, it took over a MONTH to get the medical records  The surgical procedure itself was a breeze7) noting birth control pills sometimes affect them; AMH bumped to 188 after I stopped bc for 2 months  On my protocol I was on maximum Menopur (450 per day) I started taking ganirelix to prevent ovulation around day 6 Also, I strongly recommend icing to help make the shots more bearable  When they determine you are ready, they'll tell you a specific time to take your trigger shot; your procedure will be 35 hrs later Overall, I was lucky not to have significant side effects from any part of the process or procedure Before starting I wish I knew: (a) you can't exercise during the protocol OR for another 10-14 days afterwards!

19,NYU Langone Fertility Center,cost," I was surprised when I learned he wasn't the one conducting my retrieval but he called me and put me at ease about who was doing the retrieval Fifth, it's expensive I slashed my living expenses where I could (ie, got a roommate)I had my first cycle out of the two covered by insurance done at another practice, which proved to be a waste of time and money The biggest issue with this facility is cost They seem to make up prices out of thin air For example, they charge $1,000/year for storage when many other places charge $350-600/year Most places charge $0-35 for this, which literally involves just pulling your vials from storage They require payment up front even when your services are fully covered by insurance In my case, they charged me their cash rate and it took me 4 months and hours of my time to get them to refund the overcharge (the difference between the cash rate and the insurance-negotiated rate that I should have paid)I chose NYU for my egg freezing because they are reputed to be the top facility for this procedure in the United States, if not the world  No reason to mess up your cycle because you forgot a vial or took the wrong meds I'm unlucky that my insurance won't cover providers outside of NYU Wrong bills to insurance and over charge many times on me All they do is to send you bills for services done a couple of years ago and supposed to be fully covered by insurance(My insurance was billed $10,453 for the consultation and first blood tests, of which I owe $3,138 I haven't yet received bills for the other three visits and sets of blood work Nearly TWO years after our last failed cycle, they STARTED sending us huge bills totalling many thousands of dollars These bills make NO sense, because NYU will not even give you treatment at the Fertility Center unless you pay EVERY CENT up front Avoid at all costs I now pay an annual $ 1000 fee to keep my eggs frozen, and I have been told by friends that can transfer them to other services at a cost of $ 1500 for 5 years  In the meantime, after speaking with someone below her at the office, I called insurance myself and relayed all the info - Insurance told me to go ahead with the procedure  I was told that Recombine would accept my insurance - and my insurance did pay them over $1500 for the carrier map testing, but yet I still received a bill from Recombine for over 4 hundreds dollars  (Even though they only charge people without insurance $345)  My husband and I got some tests done here and it was extremely expensive, even though the facility and lab were both in-network  We understand these things can be pricey but we didn't get a head's up or anything - just a massive bill I did 6 cycles there and each one was fine-tuned to my response with each cycle  (They also will check your insurance for you to see if any of the medications are covered I came in for my retrieval and they said they wouldn't do my retrieval unless I on-the-spot paid them $5k I'm 24 and have cancer, my oncologist referred me here because they give you a discounted rate to freeze your eggs ($6950 total) I was sent a bill of $6950, exactly the cost that was discussed prior to the egg freeze cycle I paid the full amount, than 2 months after the whole process is over they send me another bill for $950 for anesthesia Very frustrating when you think that bill is paid and they hit you with another one out of nowhere  I was charged a co-pay for my visit even though I have full infertility coverage  My insurance told me that they paid 100% of the claim and that I should not have been charged","In the meantime, after speaking with someone below her at the office, I called insurance myself and relayed all the info - Insurance told me to go ahead with the procedure .

21,RMA of New York,doctor," Dr Stein and his practice came highly recommended from my husband's (MD) colleagues- and it's hard to argue with his amazing success rates! After months of trying to conceive unsuccessfully, and in light of my husband beginning chemotherapy and my history of endometriosis, Dr Stein went over all of our options in great detail From the first meeting, his staff and colleagues told us everything we could expect from timelines and treatments all the way down to medications Absolutely no corners were cut before and during the pandemic- the team was so incredibly thorough conducting every possible test and taking every possible precaution throughout all treatments We are very fortunate that our first embryo transfer was a success, and owe it all to Dr Stein and his wonderful team! Even as we graduate to the absolutely perfect OB Dr Stein recommended, RMA continues to check in to see how baby and I are doing While we know many couples do not have the same success as us so quickly, I cannot imagine a more positive, compassionate, and personally involved team to help start our family Highly recommendWe are so grateful for Dr Flisser, Ariel Schnur, and the team at RMA for our healthy pregnancy - due May 2020 What we liked about RMA might also be what some don't like about it But we had nothing but thoughtful care through many ups and downs and most importantly, we were successful My pregnancy and baby has been healthy every step of the way and we couldn't be happier, or more grateful and we can't wait to meet our little one Dr Flisser always greeted me with a smile and took the time to answer our questions (and we had many!) as we went through each cycle Throughout the process I had full confidence in Dr Flisser's medical expertise and his varying approach to each cycle, and highly recommend him for IVFI had been struggling with a recent LEEP, PCOS, hypothyroidism and it seemed like the entire process of trying to get pregnant was filled with nothing but hurdles  Luckily, I was referred to RMA of New York and I am extremely grateful to Dr Stein and the RMA nurses and staff for their care and support on this journey  Dr Stein made me feel at ease during our very first meeting and was very patient and supportive, answering all of my questions and reassuring me that they can provide the help that I needMy wife and I feel very good in this place where they really help you and explain you step by step, thanks to Dr Carlos Hernandez Nieto who made us feel that we are in very good handsThanks to Dr Mukherjee I am now pregnant with our first little boy due this summer! We had a great experience at RMA & highly recommend Dr Mukherjee Although not every visit was the news we had wanted, their nurses offered so much physical and emotional support as we were going through IVF which was draining and felt like it was going nowhereFrom our first appt, Dr Lawrence Grunfeld was realistic, highly educated, and had an excellent bedside mannerWhile I know success is never guaranteed, my husband and I were really losing hope after years of trying for a family Go see Dr Grunfeld so he can help you figure out howAfter so many years of infertility, I knew I would get pregnant with Dr Grunfeld and his team of nurses We our persistence & Dr Grunfeld expertise, we got pregnant and had twin girls Good luck getting a phone call having someone follow up with you, there is a general number you call were you are placed on hold for a while until they decided to respond  Your physician does not typically work with you after the consultation there are doctors who deal with the hundreds of cycling patients so its a crap shoot essentially (you may get a decent doctor you may not they dont care at all) They get results or positive pregnancies due to volume of around 500+ woman at any given time,however i would not be surprised at all if they artificially inflated the numbers to lure vulnerable women into that place! It is here in the initial experience that much is lost I actually commented on this ""factory feel"" while the Dr was in the room and a nurse mentioned that ""they were really trying to get away from that sense Often emails went unanswered and I would write back multiple times to get an answerexplain what's going on during this process The human touch would help when a woman is allowing a device inside of her I am NOT a doctor, but the logic hit me and I would have at least appreciated having the discussion before the process beganand was never able to tell us why he was azoospermic In Australia, our urologist sat with both of us and talked about the male body, physiology, etc for about half an hour We spent nearly a year at RMA trying to understand the infertility issues and were never given a reasonFor over the 10 years I have been trying to have children with several failed IVF, I pray that God answer my prayer through RMA I'll  highly recommend RMA  to family and friendsDr Flisser at the RMA of NYC (Eastside) is fantastic! He's patient with his examinations and has a really calm demeanor which puts me at ease (unlike some other doctors who rush their patients through a 15 minute slot) I was on the thyroid medication on recommendation from Dr Flisser when we got pregnant with our first baby (after an earlier miscarriage a year prior)  We highly recommend Dr Stein and RMANY!!!Dr Murherjee was very professional, compassionate and knowledgeable He was able to get me pregnant after 5 1/2 years of trying with no success He also took the time to answer all of our questions I highly recommend that anyone who is having infertility issues go to him Dr Beth McAvey and her team of nurses helped my husband and I fulfill our dream of children not once but twice They run a busy office but I always felt taken care of and supported If I didn't feel comfortable with something they were eager to rectify the issue I have had many friends go through IVF and the full waiting room is something that comes along with the territory no matter where you go, for the most part I'm so happy that we went to RMA I can not recommend them enoughDr Lekovich was phenomenal She provided the perfect balance of science and compassion as she explained her strategy and approach each visit I'm 41 and we where successful on our first IVF attempt with Dr Lekovich It may be down to some luck but she was confident and knew what she was doing given our situation Highly recommendThey intentionally fail your cycle so you keep doing it 3/4 times Being treated well at 7 aDr Copperman and Jordyn Banks, RN-BSN go above and beyond for their patients--super thorough, kind, responsive, and happy to explain anything Highly recommend!Had a good experience here with Dr Flisser Also, it turns out our infertility was related to some very serious undiagnosed medical issues (liver failure) on my husband's part He's doing okay now, but the doctor he saw there (I can't remember his name) was much more interested in fixing the infertility than finding out what was causing itI saw Dr Copperman here (Jordyn Banks was his dedicated nurse/my contact)  Both were highly responsive and patient with me as I made decisions and dealt with any setbacks Yes, there are a lot of patients, but I still felt like I received one-on-one care and treatment We used Dr Copperman and I can't recommend him enough What I appreciate is that before they begin any exam, discuss details about next steps in person or draw any blood, they have us verify the name and DOB to ensure it's the correct patient I was a patient of Dr F and cornered into doing 3 IVF treatments with him before realising that the treatments are not tailor made to my body Your dr will also not be the one who does the retrieval My husband was shocked to see the back of my hospital gown and legs soaked with blood because I drew the short straw and had a trainee dr do my egg retrievalDr Copperman was real straightforward and resourceful in the information he provided me! Highly recommend him to anyone!My first experience at RMA was great largely due to the thorough, thoughtful, caring and informative care I received at the hands of Dr Leigh Rosen, M Now that I know what it feels like to have an elite doctor and 5 star service, I'm NEVER settling for less again Some may say that they feel like a number because there are so many patients but it's NYC and that is to be expected And I HIGHLY recommend Dr Flisser He is incredibly knowledgeable and my husband and I both agree that he is by far the best physician either of us have experienced in the city He has a calm demeanor to him and no question is too crazy Dr Thornton is kind and was upfront with us Highly recommend I have yet to hear from my physician and I have called her three times I was referred by a colleague and now would like to question exactly what they saw in this group During my time there, I was treated kindly, well informed and truly, like a person I was able to voice any feelings, concerns and questions and anything I needed was provided  I'm successfully and happily pregnant but honestly wish I could ride out my entire pregnancy at this office I'd recommend Dr Lederman, Dr Klein, and the amazing Martha Fennessey to my family, friends, and strangers alikeIs this a pill mill, but for fertility drugs?I didn't have a known fertility issue but was ready to start planning to conceive and was open to taking a treatment of some sort to speed things up I ended up going here for a couple of months and then stoppedMy first visit was very encouraging and I liked the doctor, who seemed knowledgeable and caringWhen I was told to come in to see a doctor, the doctor said she was just there for an ultrasound and this was not a visit for talking about stuffAt first, I thought it was a really streamlined operation; then I felt like I was on an assembly line I felt like I was just money to them If I had a real complication or issue it would feel stressful dealing with them Do your own research on effectiveness, side effects, number of times it is advisable to have certain treatments, etc I ended up getting pregnant on my own shortly after I left there, likely because I had a better sense of my ovulation cycle for which I can thank them Was a pleasure meeting & treating with himAfter 3 miscarriages, I decided that it was time to see a fertility doctor I met with Dr Flisser, who was very understanding and explained his opinions and my options In the first set of tests they found out I had a thyroid issue, sent me a prescription and referred me to an endocrinologist Dr Flisser saw me until my 8th week and was so nice and explained everythingMy husband and I had an amazing experience with RMA!  Dr Flisser was our doctor through the entire process  I suffer from PCOS and have been struggling to get pregnant for a few years  And we got pregnant after just one IUI!!  Amazing!!  If you are suffering from infertility, please visit RMA, please see Dr FlisserDespite going through the ups and downs of infertility, Dr Copperman and his team were PHENOMENAL during the whole process Dr Copperman and his team were extremely responsive during my entire process - from my emails full of questions to showing up to lend their support on my transfer day I found Dr Copperman to be very caring, knowledgeable and realistic There is alot of emotion and stress that comes along with IVF, but I felt extremely cared for at RMA I highly recommend it!Dr Flisser and his team are truly professionalI'm extremely upset at Dr Flisser Back in 2015 he helped me conceive my first baby (which I'm very thankful ) This morning I went to RMA for an ultrasound because I'm currently having an ectopic pregnancy (from a frozen transfer with Dr Stein) I asked the nurse to see Dr Flisser because I used to feel comfortable with him and he was doing the monitoring but he refused to see meGoing through fertility treatment is a difficult thing  Whether your case is diagnosed or undiagnosed it's a stressful time for anyone experiencing it I gave birth to a healthy baby boy at the end of January and am grateful to the science, medicine and consultation provided by Dr Grunfeld and his team  I highly recommend going to this practice!Having been through many many cycles of IVF and having experienced a number of IVF Centers in NYC, I wanted to provide a review of my experience at RMA and with Dr Alan Copperman  Firstly, I know most reviews cannot help but be influenced by the outcome, and I am the same  We now have 3 beautiful children, all through working with Dr Copperman and RMA  My 5 star rating doesn't mean that the center is perfect, but I would strongly recommend it given my experience there and elsewhereI found Dr Copperman to be caring, responsive and of course highly experienced and knowledgeable  I appreciated that he took time to listen to and address my questions/concerns and even suggestions, given that after multiple go's, I felt I knew how my body responded to certain medications and timings  While IVF is highly scientific, there is also an art/skill in the protocol and timings, and I felt that Dr Copperman took all of my history into regard and adjusted the protocols etc as we went through to try to deliver the best outcome, and even listened to my input  (Retrievals are still done by doctor on duty given that it is highly time-sensitive)So all in all, I would strongly recommend Dr Copperman and RMA - we have referred a number of friends and are extremely grateful for what they were able to do for usWe had a wonderful experience with Dr Flisser and the whole team at RMA  Our appointments with Dr Flisser were great - he has a warm but serious demeanor and we felt very reassured  Would highly recommend RMA and Dr Flisser After hearing so many good things about Dr Flisser, I visited him with unique fertility concerns as well as severe chronic migraines (and medication to prevent them) that complicated my strong desire for a family  I was spinning with several fears and questions even before starting the planning process, and Dr Flisser answered every single one  I had!  Over the next months, Dr Flisser tailored my fertility plan both to minimize my chronic pain, and to prepare for a healthy baby  I was continually impressed and, honestly, astonished by how quickly and thoroughly Dr Flisser responds to questions and concerns My husband and I are now thrilled to be expecting a healthy baby in three months, and I have Dr Flisser and RMA NY to thank  She is extremely knowledgeable and approachableI went to NYC RMA last month and saw DrFlisser who told me I had to lose 16 pounds before he would start treatment I said well Drflisser told me I needed to lose 16 pounds to start treatment I spoke to a friend of the family who referred me to Kofinas fertility group in Methodist hospitalI am not writing this because I am unhappy with the unsuccessful results of my treatment over two IVF cycles; I came into the IVF process at almost 40 years old eyes wide open that it very well could not work Rather, my issue with RMA which I feel the need to bring to everyone's attention is with the substandard and disappointing service and care I received   My doctor (Dr Flisser) called and spoke with my husband and I about my results    What a horrible thing to do to someone who still three years later has not gotten pregnant I am so grateful to Dr Flisser and the office staff for such a wonderful and smooth experience As someone who unfortunately has needed IVF treatments several times and gone through two different facilities and providers, RMANY has really been excellent Dr Flisser has been an amazing provider Not only is he so well knowledges but his bedside manner is impeccable  He is very  warm and makes you feel comfortable and heard as a patient going through an extremely anxiety-provoking time  I would highly recommend RMANY and Dr FlisserI began seeing Dr Flisser last summer as my husband and I were having issues conceiving naturally We will definitely be returning when we are ready for #2! Thank you to Dr Flisser, Ariel and the staff at RMA! Get past the overwhelming feeling during morning monitoring - the care I received really was amazing and I highly recommend RMA EastsideFirst I'd like to add that the Doctor's at RMA are top notch, especially Dr Stein  Dr Stein made have the worst anxiety because I never felt he was interested in making it happen with usIf I could give Dr Copperman and his amazing team 100 stars, it would not be enough  If  I had not been lucky enough to switch to Dr Copperman, I might have given up and not have had the most perfect baby boy  I had been recommended to RMA by my doctor and others originally, but at the time they did not accept my insurance  We were just fortunate enough to complete our family with our baby girl and I will never be able to thank Dr Copperman enough for creating my family Dr Flisser was very, kind, understanding, patient and thorough as our doctor I also felt very comfortable with himI absolutely loved Dr Stein's team and all the doctors I saw during monitoringDoctor Tanmoy Mukherjee  made my dreams come true! I cannot thank him enough on how much he changed me and my family's life! I will definitely recommend him to everyone  I went for a consultation and I liked the dr I met, she was very kind and thorough (Dr Allison Styne)  I've also been seen with Dr Joshua U  On the way back, I felt horrible, but it didn't affect the results thank goodness!!   They DO NOT care about their patients, they only care about $$$$  They treat you like a number, not a person The nurses were very responsive and Dr Davis was amazing:First of all, Dr Davis is a very kind and welcoming person, which is supper important in his field In addition, he is very resourceful, intelligent, patient and respectfulDr Davis was also very responsive over email and helpful in any possible wayHighly recommend!! I feel frustrated a year later after going through all this, but I've come out an expert and will not be taking any more fertility meds which seem to cause stress to my thyroid Miscarriage after miscarriage is so upsetting You will find a very caring attention to detail at every interaction Dr Stein and Dr Bar-Chama are the doctors that other doctors use for themselves and their family The Dr took us through the whole process, did an ultrasound, made it all sound super easy and hopeful We felt totally duped  I saw my actual Dr at consultation and one other time when he was doing the rounds  The Dr actually explains your situation comprehensively during consultation She is reachable by EMAIL and she, the Dr, responds! Some doctors are okay, but overall it's not a personal experience and you feel more like a number than a patienthow can I think about the wild range of reviews other than:(1) you love RMA if you got pregnant with a healthy baby (on the first try), or(2) you didn't?we are grateful every time we look at our rock star 3-year old, and are fully aware that Dr Flisser is to thank for him  Dr Flisser is extremely patient, thorough and has an excellent bedside manner  I never felt rushed and always felt like we were in good handsI had the most wonderful things to say about RMA in the beginning but to make a long story even longer:By by third IVF, and each time I emailed and met with my doctor, there was no answer as to what was going on (i why we couldn't get pregnant)I'm not even bitter at the fact that all three IVF's were unsuccessful, just bitter that no one told us what was REALLY going on I went for my second ultrasound and saw Dr Jovana Lekovich She made me second experience at RMA very unpleasant with her abrasive bedside mannerI was referred to a doctor at this practice for endocrinology and not for anything fertility based by my OBGYN 2 years ago I was angry the first time, but figured there might have been a technical glitch where they confused me with another patient Dr Mcavey is just business woman Dr Copperman has awful bedside manner And they have done the same thing to many other patients (read the other reviews on yelp)Go to Cornell- I've gone there and it is much more caring and professional They treat their patients like patients, not like targetsI could not be more grateful to Dr Mukherjee and the staff at RMAIn the beginning of my fertility treatment, I felt that there was a bit of a factory feel to the practice  It is a true group practice, where you see many drs and you are communicating more with the nurses than the Dr during treatment  Also, in speaking with many other woman who go through fertility treatment in various clinics in NYC, I learned most of the popular ones have that factory feel as many woman need help  I felt they were rooting for me every step of the wayI had met many of the drs during the treatment and I liked most  Every dr has a different doctoring style, so some personalities and styles meshed more with my needsDr Mukherjee was my main Dr, and the Dr who oversaw all my treatments  The entire fertility treatment process is difficult, it affects you physically, mentally, psychologically, emotionally and financially    I highly recommend RMA to call us back to explain the results and progress, he called us back within an hourRMA definitely feels like a fertility factory and you won't always get the warm and fuzzies here, but they're on top of it! IVF is a confusing and overwhelming process I always felt I was in good hands here We loved working with Dr Mukherjee! I would definitely recommend RMAIf I could give ZERO stars I would!! HORRIBLE!!! Talk about being treated like just another number!!! If you want to get pregnant & you're in NYC go to Sher with Dr T, Dr Dicken or Dr Wang!! They are the best!!! At the age of 36 and after trying for over a year and a half and after 2 IVFs, 1 FET transfer, & 4 IUIs, we finally discovered Sher  :) Dr Dicken was on maternity leave for the first IUI, so Dr T performed the 1st one and Dr Wang did my second IUI, both were great!!!! Dr Dicken is amazing, as are Dr T & Dr Wang! Dr Dicken sat with us for over an hour in the initial consultation and revamped my medication regiment to focus on egg quality rather than quantity  The doctors and nurses are all so warm & make you feel so comfortable At least they removed the charge after we got our family friend who is a lawyer involved and threatened legal actionDr K still rains supreme I'm so happy that I was able to conceive!I can't recommend RMA, and specifically Dr Copperman, highly enough  When you're going through the process, you get to know all the doctors depending on what day you need to come in, and there wasn't anyone I met who I didn't like  But Dr Copperman was ""my"" doctor and made what can be a difficult, emotional process so much easier  I genuinely felt like the whole staff was thrilled to see our success, and I cried on 'graduation day' when I was discharged (to, by the way, an OB who 'wasn't taking new patients' when I called until the doctor at RMA went above and beyond to get me in)  I had questions, but the receptionist told me someone could speak to me when I donated the sperm  Then I went to the office for my appt and they'd lost the fax again! After more conversation they then found it again  Then when I spoke with someone she told me that any sperm I donated that day couldn't be used for the egg/surrogate because I needed a physical first, which they couldn't do that daytl:dr: This place has decent doctors but terrible communication and awful staff The stress the latter two cause is enough to keep you from getting pregnant Yes, Dr Klein is pretty good, but the whole experience is terrible No one ever really answered my questions enough to where I felt comfortable going forward5 Stars! My husband and I had a very positive experience with RMA, both with the supporting staff and under the care of Dr Eric Flisser Upon my initial consultation, Dr Flisser spent over an hour speaking to me about my medical history, walking through potential options to help with conception and the associated factors to be aware of Furthermore, he helped thoroughly explain what was happening at each stage pre-conception and during early pregnancy in an honest and realistic way Upon leaving RMA to transfer to a regular OB, Dr Flisser went to great lengths to help us find a doctor that would be just right for our needs The nurse named Alyssa especially stood out for her personable touch to in-person meetings and calls But two weeks after they discharged us and my wife was evidently losing our baby, they couldn't have cared less First, let's talk about the waiting room After  a 45 minute wait I saw dr grunfeld Horrible bedside manners He barely looked at me and my husband and rushed us through the appt We then met with kim, the ivf coordinator and permanent bitch face lady If u want to feel like ur in a factory and don't want personal care, then by all means go hereI had a wonderful experience at RMA, specifically with Dr Copperman He is one of the most caring and knowledgeable doctors I have ever seen I saw him twice- for two different issues- and each time he remained calm, confident and reassuring I no way felt like I was a patient in a big practice Dr Copperman developed a personal relationship with me and made me feel like my case mattered He responds promptly to emails and even called me on one late Sunday night because he knew I was discouraged I highly recommend him and RMA I was shocked of course, but decided to countercheck: obviously they called the wrong place, and therefore got wrong information Dr Sandler called me back himself several times when I needed his consultation He helped to find an OB/GYN even though I didn't have mine, and it was extremely difficult to make an appointmentDr Daniel Stein is a funny, kind, hard-working guy whom I really liked They gave us bad advice regarding a rebate program (Compassionate Care) that could have saved us literally thousands of dollarsMy husband and I had a wonderful -- and most importantly, successful -- experience with RMA of NY  Dr Mukherjee was an excellent dr who is extremely positive and personable without sugar coating things In my view, going with a practice that sees hundreds of patients each year and pools together the knowledge and expertise of a dozen or more expert doctors is exactly what I want  Despite the largeness of the practice,i never had any trouble getting my questions answered or personal attention when needed The only time I spoke with my Dr after 1st consult was when he 'couldn't proceed' because of a missing paymentAfter 2 years of dealing with infertility, 5 IUI's, 2 miscarriages and a million tears   I My husband and I both went through a lot of tests  Dr Sandler and his team discussed the issues I was dealing with   He met with me a few times before we started the treatment   Both Ashlie and Kirsten  were my cheerleaders and my voice of reason Today I am 8 weeks pregnant with twins!  We heard their healthy hearts beating and I forgot all about the 2 years of torture I dealt with before meeting Dr SandlerDr Sandler is an honest, straight forward and an unbelievably smart doctor - there is no BS with him  I could not possibly recommend a doctor more than I recommend Dr Sandler and his team  He was an absolute godsend!  Me and my little family are graduating from RMA and I can honestly say, I do not want to leave! Thank you Dr Sandler you finally gave us our miracle(S)! Never going back We've since found much more caring and attentive practices and now prefer seeing a doctor who actually will care for you! Difficult as it is to find these days, the effort is worth it Dr Grunfeld was fantastic! He's the kind of doc you know, knows his stuff and its very comforting! Whilst we ended up falling pregnant naturally anyway (one month away from starting treatments!) we felt very comfortable he would have gotten us over the line  The whole donor process, under the best of circumstances, is highly emotional and undignified  It truly is like a factory  RMA never recommended that I speak to a therapist or seek any kind of emotional counseling, despite the complicated situation involved with receiving donated eggs  BUT there is no excuse for the staff's cold demeanor and their failure to treat patients as a human being  Their non-individualized approach to fertility patients is a dangerous, expensive mistake, and ultimately heartbreaking in the end I wish that these doctors saw me as more than a uterus and a checkbookI've been going here since July 2013 and tried to keep an open mind, but for a practice that handles such important and sensitive work, I've been really disappointed at the complete lack of compassion and care  I saw Dr Sandler and loved him  He explained things clearly to me, was proactive, and was reassuring without making any false promises  I always felt like I was in excellent hands, even at the time when things were not looking good for usI started treatment at RMA in April 2014 at the Westchester office with Dr Jeff Klein, due to a recommendation from a friend, who had been to Cornell and had a terrible experience You can tell when you meet with him that he became a RE because he truly cares and will do whatever is in his power to help you I have never met a more compassionate and dedicated Dr and my husband absolutely agrees! The fact that he personally answers your emails and in an extremely timely manner is something that is very unheard of in this field When you go to a Dr as frequently as you do for fertility treatment, you really get to know all the players I would actually look forward to going to see them! My husband also really felt this way about the staff and enjoyed going to the office I can never repay Dr Klein and his entire staff for not only helping me to get pregnant but for all the support along the way I needed a solid treatment plan, fast appointments (since I went either before work or during lunch hour), and responses to my emails/calls when needed  I absolutely LOVE Dr Mukherjee and feel more comfortable with him than my regular (female) OB The RN staff is very friendly and always follows up and I can simply request an appointment with Dr M to go over options Small side note - if you have PCOS and are slightly overweight and are absolutely sick and tired of every RE telling you to lose weight when you've been trying really hard to do just that - Dr Mukherjee is absolutely awesome in that respect He simply trusts that you're doing your best, gives you a few suggestions (once!) and focuses on getting you pregnant rather than stuffed with kale and celery  Further, the original plan of taking the injection for 3 nights, skipping a night, then coming in 36 hours later for ultrasound/labs didnt make sense such that I called the office BACK to ensure those were the instructions, They were repeated to me in the same way, so that's what I didMy wife and I had a very good experience here with Dr Allison Styne and Amber Madsen was our nurse  If you are trying to get pregnant I highly recommend RMA of NY  Every time I received IUI, I was allowed to stay there only 10 minutes and I always felt as if was rushed out And I would never recommend to a friend From the time I entered the office I felt like a number I have NEVER even posted a review on yelp","Dr Stein and his practice came highly recommended from my husband's (MD) colleagues- and it's hard to argue with his amazing success rates! to family and friendsDr Flisser at the RMA of NYC (Eastside) is fantastic! He's patient with his examinations and has a really calm demeanor which puts me at ease (unlike some other doctors who rush their patients through a 15 minute slot) I was on the thyroid medication on recommendation from Dr Flisser when we got pregnant with our first baby (after an earlier miscarriage a year prior) . Dr Flisser was our doctor through the entire process . I suffer from PCOS and have been struggling to get pregnant for a few years . And we got pregnant after just one IUI!! . Firstly, I know most reviews cannot help but be influenced by the outcome, and I am the same . We now have 3 beautiful children, all through working with Dr Copperman and RMA . Would highly recommend RMA and Dr Flisser After hearing so many good things about Dr Flisser, I visited him with unique fertility concerns as well as severe chronic migraines (and medication to prevent them) that complicated my strong desire for a family . Over the next months, Dr Flisser tailored my fertility plan both to minimize my chronic pain, and to prepare for a healthy baby . What a horrible thing to do to someone who still three years later has not gotten pregnant I am so grateful to Dr Flisser and the office staff for such a wonderful and smooth experience As someone who unfortunately has needed IVF treatments several times and gone through two different facilities and providers, RMANY has really been excellent Dr Flisser has been an amazing provider Not only is he so well knowledges but his bedside manner is impeccable .

I had not been lucky enough to switch to Dr Copperman, I might have given up and not have had the most perfect baby boy .

I went for a consultation and I liked the dr I met, she was very kind and thorough (Dr Allison Styne) . On the way back, I felt horrible, but it didn't affect the results thank goodness!! .

22,RMA of New York,advice," Even through the COVID-19 pandemic, the offices were able to stay open and went to great lengths to ensure every visit was as safe and sanitary as possible Dr Sandler is a great person and, while I was anxious about everything, he made the energy of the whole process more bright and fun Thanks Dr Sandler and team!!!! I worked with Dr Flisser and his assistants Courtney and Ariel, and all of three of them were exceptional Anyone who has been through this knows how organizationally complex it can be, and Flisser's team were on top of everything  I am now 25 weeks pregnant with a baby girl due July 2020 There were many tears and feelings of depression that this would never happen for us If you are reading this review, I wish I had known about this place much sooner Good luck to all of you  hang in there! I hope it works out for all of you Absolutely loved Clara, his nurse, she was really my link btw the doctor and me, if I wanted to try something new, she always brought it up to Dr Grunfeld You go in for a consultation were upon the physician promises you the world acts so positive and sucks you in to vortex of costly treatments Im surprised no one has ever called them out on their abusive practices or how they havent been exposed for the scam they are  We plan to use RMA when we try for a second child in the futureother times they were notno talking, no explanation of what they were looking for, just clicking on the screen and taking measurements I asked questions, asked them to show me what we were looking atI wrote an email and came in to the office to talk about my frustration For such a significant financial investment, I was frustrated that our wishes had been disregarded because it wasn't the ""typical protocol"" We hadn't been consulted before this decision was made and I'm still disappointed that this occurredI had 19 eggs under treatment, and was initially excited What she was able to tell us in one short session simplified and focused the process It may be important for your team to be aware that intramuscular injections at the top of the bum are no longer allowed in Australia, even for doctor's to administer in this area, due to it's proximity to the sciatic nerve This was in my opinion, bad practice (perhaps you might want to reconsider having patients stick themselves in this risky location) The Doctors are very good with qualified nurses ready to help any time you call  We are now pregnant and just discharged today!  Very happy customers  We had access to a nutritionist and a counselor  They truly are the #1 place for fertility issues and I trusted them implicitly He is definitely worth the visit I can not thank them enough We are so glad we were recommended and chose Dr Lekovich I hope somebody has the guts to file a lawsuit, they should be closed down! is more important than you might think - especially when you're bloated, tired, and have sore veins   Can't imagine a way to have improved this experience Have never had a better start-to-finish doctor visit than this Which is what we were asking them to do, so I can't really be upset, but it would have been nice if they insisted he see a specialist to figure out what was going on with his health Anyway, we love our perfect baby and hope to return again when the time is right Furthermore, they were low-pressure and allowed me to explore as many options as I was comfortable with while helping me ground my decisions in statistics personalized to my situation He is the reason we have our 2 beautiful girls!The only complaint that I had was that they use SS#'s to verify patients UNLESS you ask for a temporary number to replace your SS# I asked for a Temporary # and it was fine thereafter Good luck if you decide to go with RMA! I left the office relieved and confident that I am receiving the very best treatment THANK YOU for restoring my faith in the medical communityBeing a physician, I am disappointed and abhorred how these doctors believe they are treating patients If I had practiced the same, I would have no patients I am truly, truly upsetFertility struggles, I've learned, are one of the most stressful experiences to have to endure They talked to me a lot about getting ready to have twins because, you know, this was going to get me sooo pregnant After that visit, I was never able to talk to a doctor again I just kept saying, I need to talk to someone, get some information, more medical advice or some follow-up That alarmed me since I had so one to talk to about treatments and was finding a lot of info that I had questions about Questions but no one to answer them  I wish you the best of luck wherever you decide to go! I never felt pressured to do anything I did not want to do I did not pursue further testing and shortly after my thyroid got to normal levels I was able to get pregnant and stay pregnant  His straight to the point style was definitely appreciatedI highly recommend Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York I had an appointment with her on April 17, 2019 Yes, he refused to see me saying he was too busy WOW!!! Extremely disappointed with his professionalism  But I will try to provide a holistic perspective of my experience there also - hopefully it might help others going through the process  I also like that at RMA, the process now is for your doctor to do the transfer rather than any doctor who is on duty  No question was too small or sillyDr Flisser is the best of the best  He is always three steps ahead  He truly makes every single patient feel like his priority--a feat, considering what must be an incredibly busy and demanding schedule  Thank you Dr Flisser, Ariel, and RMA NY Eastside  Keep up the awesome work!SHE NEVER CALLS BACK I was at work fighting back tears and got so depressed  I'm going there tomorrow, and I pray that they work better than RMA""  There was no further explanation, nor did I receive any call from the doctor or any subsequent follow upAt this point I knew that regardless of the disappointing results, clearly RMA was not the right practice for me  As such, I called to request my medical records to be transferred to another fertility treatment center (CCRM)   At the time, I spoke to someone in your records department who asked why we were not continuing my treatment at RMA   We heard nothing further from RMA in this regard   Shame on all of youAfter finalizing the cryo preserve issue I thought the RMA nightmare was over I could not be more thankful for his patience and guidance throughout the process  When I tried to call billing and ask for questions, the staff were clueless and had an attitude  Especially beware of Hiura, the information she gave me was grossly incorrect  Furthermore her attitude was off putting  It's a shame because the Doctor's at RMA are top notch, the rest of the staff are below standard  My new Dr Laughed at his notes and apologized for the time wasted there  They are interested in stats not helping you grow a family  I have been on this scary fertility roller coaster for about three years now  If that doesn't say a lot about this man, I don't know what does They are ALWAYS available, and truly on this ride with you  The day I walked into RMA is among the luckiest of my life Didn't push IVF right away since we had no known issue but instead tried other methods first that were less invasive  I also recall looking up their numbers (successful rate) in the national database, and they looked good compare to others Klein in subsequent visits, and he had always been very caring and he takes initiative in asking if I had any questions  They only see you as a cash cow!! GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!If you are Hashimotos or low thyroid, you must be your own advocate My TSH ideally would be below 2 That said, had I known to call off cycle, the office  would have - but since I'm going to experts, it would have been nice if they had been proactive and called off the cycle I know you get excited, but if you have to defer a cycle, just do it Patience is everythingThe doctors here are some of the best and you will note the many times each has been noted for their excellence by the many awards for Top Doctors of the year Most of all, these doctors get you the results you seek without seeming to just raid your insurance and/or wallet Since he had a vasectomy from a previous marriage we needed to get around a roadblock, as it were  We were probably there for 2 hours Since we didn't have 25k lying around, and RMA kept adding charges to our total that weren't told to us up front (despite repeatedly asking what our end total would be so we could plan), we put off the process for about 3 months while we tried to figure out what to do If RMA had done their due diligence we would have saved time and stress and heartache of thinking we couldn't afford to even try  The Dr never explained anything except the obvious and of course if you are new to the process how would you know what questions to ask  RMA is basically a corporation that just wants money  I would never recommend them and I advise everyone to carefully do their due diligence, even if a trusted Dr recommends them YOU MUST BE KIDDING ME !!!! YOU HAVE NO FREAKING DOCTORS !!! I literally see 7 listed on your business card !! Good luck to everyone out there still looking for an answer  He spent plenty of time going over all of our questions, concerns and options at every turn Looks like they were just looking to make money off of unsuspecting patients Meeting with the doctor wasn't helpful either as she just ended up repeating the same information She thought is was one thing then another Bottom line- there was no sense of communication here We found a great IVF doc through Cornell and sticking with himI am a patient of Dr Sandler She is very rude and condescending I am new to fertility treatments When I asked questions or for her to explain the next step she gave me attitude as if this is something I should already know Which, is just incompetentI've gone to six infertility institutions 3 times false information in a row and charged $2,000 on my credit card without my consent which was ridiculous And also, his skill is very doubtful I had worst 2 week-recovery time after he conducted my retrieval STAY AWAY FROM THIS WAY OVER VALUED PLACEVery impersonal I've heard that for IVF they take things more seriously as the other preliminary treatments Wish this nightmare will be over soon Thanks to them I have 2 beautiful healthy babies And if I ever wanted to speak directly with the dr, I did  I truly believe I would not have babies right now had it not been for him and his expertise  It is important to be your own advocate in all medical decisions but it is also extremely important to go to the BEST DOCTORS, KNOW AND FEEL that you are in the best possible hands and TRUST them Was on upper east side but I went to Soho office for daily monitoring When we wanted the dr They are not touchy feely, but I didn't care about that as long as they knew what they were doing That's why 4 starsSimply put- it is more a business than an authentic medical association  Do your due diligence before seeking care at RMA The star is really minus a star) Therefore, stay away from storing specimens at Gramercy IVF We HIGHLY recommend Sher above all else!!! Don't walk away from RMA, RUN AWAY!!!!  GO TO CORNELL MUCH BETTER!!!""  I was pregnant within 10 weeks of my first appointment  It wasn't a particularly touchy-feely experience, but I wasn't looking for touchy-feely, I was looking to get pregnant  I'm now in my second trimester and wouldn't hesitate to return if and when I decide to have more children  Because I'm leaving for South America soon, where Zika is present, I wanted to get this done soon They said I needed a referral from my doctor and blood tests for infectious diseases  I had these done and my doctor faxed over the documents Called them back and they said they didn't have them  I asked them to look harder  So I contacted another facility (with better reviews than this one) and they told me that donors need to have no sexual activity for no less than two days and no more than five for the best donation I think the ladies at the front desk disliked me because I asked questions the first time I was in I'm glad I didn't She didn't explain half the stuff that was listed in this guide they give you, and she was so disorganized and scatterbrained It's hard to even get someone on the phone to talk about it He was very patient in answering questions and very approachableWould definitely recommend this organization! Please find another practice that values patient care over dollar signs I am very disappointed by this officeI would never return to RMA despite the fact they they have great physicians This is not the right place for you if you want to see the same doctor each visit They have done this 1 million times and this is why they have the success that they doI went here last week for a consultation and it was truly  an awful experienceare u kidding me?? A fight erupted Provided no info at all But if u care abut ur self and want the best care that u deserve then go elsewhere I would recommend Dr Sandler and his team to anyone thinking about reproduction assistance  There are numerous other places, I should have done more research in advance He met with me and heard my questions, and was patient with my low-impact approach That was a really bad momentAfter a brief experience at RMA, I decided that their practice was not for me and gladly found the care I was looking for elsewhere after two months of making payments! Literally I decided to switch Fertility doctors  After a recommendation from my friend and then another random recommendation from my mother's coworker  I met with Dr Sandler in January I had a lot of questions and needed a lot of reassurance  Angela, the women who handles all of the meds is an absolute savior Dr Bar Chama is a quack We requested our medical records from the practice because we wanted someone closer to our home in Long Island to follow our care We declined to pay saying that at that point there was no need for the records, we had to repeat several tests and they had been woefully inadequate in responding to our original request The next thing we get is a collections notice All you are is a person with a dollar sign attached and they will find ways to maximize whatever money they can get out of you Stay away from this practice They see a lot of patients and move fast as they are a busy place, so have your questions prepared in advance and you will do well  Their ""one size fits all"" approach to fertility patients probably cost me a pregnancy  And after I miscarried twice with donor eggs, I simply couldn't believe the response:  ""it's probably the adenomyosis you have I have found that every woman is pushed through the same process, given the same advice and has the same plan, regardless of the fact that many of us are there in the first place because we have serious medical issues that demand attention But after my last miscarriage (my second), my doctor simply said, ""Well, this happens and we have no reason to worry, so we'll have you talk to the nurse and we can start again"" No sympathy, no humanity, and worse, no thought, for a moment, that maybe we should change the way we're doing things instead of plowing aheadI wish that there were other options out there for women Unfortunately, I want a baby so badly that I will probably continue to subject myself to this Nurses and doctors alike just want to get you in and out The doctors who see you when you come in for monitoring are just rushing to get to the next patient, so they offer little to no information unless you ask a million questions and even then, will try very hard to palm you off on the nurse if they can They can't handle the patients they have now  I have read complaints about his bedside manner but I found the opposite to be true I was scheduled to go to Cornell and she strongly suggested I just call Dr Klein and see if he had any availability The next day, they were able to see me, which is so important if you know how timely fertility treatment is From the moment that I first met Dr Klein, he put my mind at ease and was so patient with my long list of questions and concerns There was never a moment that I felt rushed or that I was asking too many questions Cheryl, Lissandra, Audrey, and Raquel became so special to me over the months with the highs and lows that fertility treatment brings Walking through such an emotional, physical, and financial process is really difficult I recommend them to anyone who will listen to meI understand why people would write negative reviews because it really isn't a place where you get your hand held But after over a year of ttc and learning every possible treatment available for my condition (PCOS), I no longer needed my hand held Yes, if you are JUST finding out about your infertility and want a place where you can cry it out after a failed attempt (believe me, I've been there) - this won't be the perfect place""   First of all, I am a doctor and I am quite certain and am very familiar with dosing instructions  Then I am told after the fact that I shouldv'e injected last night and then told it was MY ""misinterpretation"" that screwed up the schedule  Amber was also amazing  Fingers crossedThe doctors might have good reputations  I stopped going backI have NO stars to give this doctor office ""Oh sorry it was our mistake"" is what I was told Completely ignoring me as if they were a clerk in a supermarket  I had to ask multiple times to be checked out while each young woman tried passing me on to the next Never even acknowledging the sensitivity of why I and other patience are there When I kindly asked for a supervisor I was asked what do you mean a supervisor? We don't have a supervisor Just awful! And to get your medical records forwarded Forget about itit's a struggle and disheartening experience I don't think the office workers realize that they are there to help PATIENTS not customers Nor do I read reviews","Even through the COVID-19 pandemic, the offices were able to stay open and went to great lengths to ensure every visit was as safe and sanitary as possible Dr Sandler is a great person and, while I was anxious about everything, he made the energy of the whole process more bright and fun Thanks Dr Sandler and team!!!! We are now pregnant and just discharged today! . We had access to a nutritionist and a counselor . They truly are the #1 place for fertility issues and I trusted them implicitly He is definitely worth the visit I can not thank them enough We are so glad we were recommended and chose Dr Lekovich I hope somebody has the guts to file a lawsuit, they should be closed down! is more important than you might think - especially when you're bloated, tired, and have sore veins . I wish you the best of luck wherever you decide to go! I never felt pressured to do anything I did not want to do I did not pursue further testing and shortly after my thyroid got to normal levels I was able to get pregnant and stay pregnant . Extremely disappointed with his professionalism . But I will try to provide a holistic perspective of my experience there also - hopefully it might help others going through the process . No question was too small or sillyDr Flisser is the best of the best . Keep up the awesome work!SHE NEVER CALLS BACK I was at work fighting back tears and got so depressed . I'm going there tomorrow, and I pray that they work better than RMA . We heard nothing further from RMA in this regard . Shame on all of youAfter finalizing the cryo preserve issue I thought the RMA nightmare was over I could not be more thankful for his patience and guidance throughout the process . Especially beware of Hiura, the information she gave me was grossly incorrect . My new Dr Laughed at his notes and apologized for the time wasted there . They are interested in stats not helping you grow a family . If that doesn't say a lot about this man, I don't know what does They are ALWAYS available, and truly on this ride with you . The day I walked into RMA is among the luckiest of my life Didn't push IVF right away since we had no known issue but instead tried other methods first that were less invasive . GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!If you are Hashimotos or low thyroid, you must be your own advocate My TSH ideally would be below 2 That said, had I known to call off cycle, the office . RMA is basically a corporation that just wants money . It is important to be your own advocate in all medical decisions but it is also extremely important to go to the BEST DOCTORS, KNOW AND FEEL that you are in the best possible hands and TRUST them Was on upper east side but I went to Soho office for daily monitoring When we wanted the dr They are not touchy feely, but I didn't care about that as long as they knew what they were doing That's why 4 starsSimply put- it is more a business than an authentic medical association . Do your due diligence before seeking care at RMA The star is really minus a star) Therefore, stay away from storing specimens at Gramercy IVF We HIGHLY recommend Sher above all else!!! I was pregnant within 10 weeks of my first appointment . I'm now in my second trimester and wouldn't hesitate to return if and when I decide to have more children . Literally I decided to switch Fertility doctors . Their one size fits all approach to fertility patients probably cost me a pregnancy . And after I miscarried twice with donor eggs, I simply couldn't believe the response: . Fingers crossedThe doctors might have good reputations . I stopped going backI have NO stars to give this doctor office Oh sorry it was our mistake is what I was told Completely ignoring me as if they were a clerk in a supermarket . I had to ask multiple times to be checked out while each young woman tried passing me on to the next Never even acknowledging the sensitivity of why I and other patience are there When I kindly asked for a supervisor I was asked what do you mean a supervisor? And to get your medical records forwarded Forget about itit's a struggle and disheartening experience I don't think the office workers realize that they are there to help PATIENTS not customers Nor do I read reviews"

24,RMA of New York,clinic,"Great practice with a kind, knowledgable team Covid interrupted our IVF process and they were great about sharing updates and keeping us informed  - particularly challenging given how little information was available anywhere! A particular word of praise is owed to the nursing staff who are always attentive and graciousI can't say enough good things about our experience at RMA Even when we were emotional or conflicted about an issue, she remained positive and helpful The financial coordinators also worked so hard for weeks to find every possible way to cut down the costs of treatment, and also responded to all of our questions nearly instantly The nurses and other physicians were also all so nice and really went the extra mile to make me feel comfortable and fully informed I knew I could call the office and speak to a nurse at any time if I had a question or medical emergencyDr Buyuk was amazing! The whole staff is very helpful and professional RMA is a huge practice with the best fertility specialists in the City - that means the best lab team, the best physicians and nurses, offices around the City, great facilities, and even a social worker for the emotional aspects of the journey Collectively, they have more experience as a team than any other, and you can feel it A large practice with a huge volume of patients also means that there are very occasional issues with billing, call backs take a couple of hours, and the waiting room can get packed some mornings, if you come in on the later side I know the teams at CCRM and Cornell are wonderful too, but my husband and I recommend RMA without hesitationThey were fantastic, very clean, organized and fully equipped! Dr Sandler and his team is especially nice and efficient! My husband and I had a beautiful baby via IVF and can't be more happy about it Almost as important were his team who worked with me on scheduling and communication on everything from ordering medication to dosages They have been very helpful, understanding, caring and patient This process can be very long and taxing but the team at RMA helps you get through the process with their attentiveness to your needsI also like this practice because they have morning monitoring hours--from 7am to 8:30am you can walk in without making an appointment and still get to work on time  If you arrive right at 7am there's rarely a wait and I loved how convenient it was, especially with the frequency of getting blood drawn and testingI can't say enough great things about how efficient this place is run and the quality of their staff and doctors Don't let that full waiting room turn you off, there are so many of us in the same boat They move through the crowd rather quickly Before discovering RMA, we were at another fertility clinic Our old place also chewed up hours of my busy work schedule The convenience of monitoring hours and their fast paced staff, makes RMA seamless He and his nurses understand how grueling this journey can be and never let you lose sight of the end goal Although an emotional and physical journey, I would come back to this place in a heartbeat We were a team The office operates like a well oiled machine, excellent if you are working, I was never there more than 1hr (and that's on a really busy morning) Everyone is very nice from the nurses to the finance teamIf i could give this facility a negative review I would; just to warn people about the abuses that go on in facility towards their paying clients You then pay and your life is in the hands of overworked nurses and 1500 and hour techs and you are ignored as are your needs everything is put into a computer which leads to many errors and things being incredibly disorganized and there are huge mistakes made in the process however, they will never give it a second glance nor does anyone care to there is a huge cover up system in place when you need your records there is a two week waiting period to have a 1500 an hour tech go through everything to make sure the info is accurate and even after the two week you still have to wait and call and harass the one number there is to call The only part of RMA that actually knows what they are doing unfortunately is the finance team  Some people may not like that you see different doctors for monitoring while in cycle; I personally didn't mind because the office is very efficient and I was usually in and out of monitoring in ~30 minutes or less    I wish I had gone to RMA first instead of the other clinic where I wasted 3 months (and three IUIs)Your larger desk staff were difficult to engage and generally lacked warmthWhen I arrived for my scans and blood work, often times a doctor would come in, state their name and immediately begin the ultrasound She also commented on the difference in warmth and intimacy at NYU vs RMA and has since told all of her girlfriends to go to NYU instead She then examined my husband and immediately found varicocoele, which had resulted in a shrinking of the testes and therefore greatly reduced fertility At the doctor's the other day, I learned that I have hit the sciatic nerve Self administered injections are stressful enough He and his staff were professional in doing weekly blood and ultrasound tests in the first 5 weeks of the pregnancy and would promptly respond to any questions He also gave a great referral to our OB who delivered our baby last week!  His team and the faculty at RMANY is professional, punctual, always smiling, and easy to reach  Nurses like Krista and the IFV coordinator Kiran made our lives so much easier while we went through everything  It was always easy to get in touch with billing with our many questions  This place is busy, especially east side - but don't mistake it for a haphazard baby factory He is very patient and kindI had a very positive experience at RMA Thank you for helping us start our family Please allow me the massive privilege of commenting exclusively on the monitoring experience provided by this RMA location, nothing else Process: Monitoring is clearly done in large batches, but is executed very efficiently There are usually a good 20 women in the waiting room, which plays upbeat pop, has strong WiFi, and offers lots of recent magazines One could comfortably wait quite a while here, but 25 minutes is the maximum I sat through The receptionists do the work of finding your orders, informing the medical staff, and printing your labels so that you should never have to explain ""why you're in today"" All you do is print your first name on a sheet at the front desk and wait to be called Results from the morning are provided by 3 p every afternoon  Pretty impressive! Also explains the sobering 7-8:30 a Personnel: So happy to find that the majority of the staff here are female The nurses are sensitive to the toils of regular blood-testing and gently ask which arm you prefer; the front-desk staff always wish clients a good morning OBGYNs themselves have been a little cold and brief, but never rude My hormone cycle was much easier to get a hang of with this reliable and organized location Perhaps it was the lack of stress, the comforting staff, and the manageable time commitment that supported my eventual 40-egg retrievalRMA of NYC (eastside) made my husband and I parents - twice!! The team of doctors and nurses were exceptionally knowledgeable and kindDr Sandler and the staff at the 60th street RMA clinic are exceptionally professional, welcoming and overall very caring We have had a positive experience with the clinic overall I would recommend this clinic to any family or friend I feel that shouldn't be available for all their staff to see when you call etcIf you want to feel like a battery farm hen then this is the place for you It feels like the drs here see you coming with dollar signs in their eyesI had an excellent experience at RMA The staff at RMA made the whole IVF process as simple as it can be with their organization, resources, and support I always felt that I received individualized attention throughout my time at RMA Every single staff member that I encountered was wonderful from billing, to coordinators, to nurses, to phlebotomists, to the doctors From the start of this whole process he has been accurate, thorough and professional Cannot express how grateful I am to have worked with himMy wife and I had a great experience with RMA We had our initial consultation with Dr Kimberley Thornton at the Soho clinic and subsequent visits at the Eastside location for blood-work, ultrasounds, and intrauterine inseminationEveryone was very helpful and the whole clinic is very LGBT friendly This is a very sensitive subject in any couple, woman or mans life and they make it stressful and confusing RMA and it's staff (I mainly went to the Westchester offices except for a couple NYC visits and of course the major prucedures) were wonderful The staff cares and are sensitive to what individuals are going through In the end, as I just got discharged yesterday, it was kind of bittersweet to leave Nurses who seemed really overworked since they would only talk for moments at a time, literally MOMENTS at a time This is the only interaction I had with people I had started getting information by reading the websites of other fertility clinicsThis place is too chaotic and gave me anxietyEveryone from front staff to clinical were super helpful & professional! Dr Flisser was super thorough & easy to talk to I called and the appointment was scheduled for within the week (rare for specialists) He ordered a million tests first and the nurse walked me through how to schedule and when I give this place an A++  We had even been to a different fertility clinic prior without any positive results  Dr Flisser and his staff were so helpful, always there to answer any questions I had The staff is professional, helpful and kind She is a wonderful resource to the company All of the office staff and doctors are knowledgeable and demonstrate that they really care! The entire practice is like a well oiled machine, highly efficientam very displeased with the services that I got from Jovana Leukovich and her staff She was 45 minutes late for the appointment She explained that her first patient took longer than she expected and she was late all day long She didn't bother to call me to reschedule 45 minutes later, I could have left work later if she had rescheduled She overlooked measles and rubella bloodwork as well as hormones day 3 which i brought and that bloodwork was made on actual day 3 and on another day right before the appointment Her absent mindness caused billing my fertility benefits for the same procedure I really feel bad for RMANY and Leukovich and I really think that i need to write reviews with this story so that people avoid this ""doctor"" I guess I do not look like $$$$$$$$ sign anymoreWhile RMA of NY was clearly a large facility, it felt like a well oiled machine with wonderful staff  From our Doctor, Dr Grunfeld, and his team - front desk reception, nurses, coordinators billing department etc - everyone was extraordinarily helpful and friendly  I found that at RMA everyone was sensitive to what we were going through and I had a great experience despite our circumstances  My experience at other clinics is that they just kept trying more of the same even when things weren't workingRMA also has seamless coordination with its lab, which I did not find to be the case at other centers  This means that if you choose to do PGD, it is a very smooth process - whereas at another center, they outsourced this and it required additional administration and processes and altogether did not inspire confidenceThe other things I appreciated about RMA are the efficiency with which the office is run and the competent staff  I like that they have a central coordinator for each patient who you can reach out to with any questions - again, other clinics did not have this and you had to deal with different nurses all the time, most of who had no idea who you were or your background  Given that you will be spending a LOT of time at the clinic for monitoring etc, it's also important that the clinic is efficiently run  While it's unavoidable that most clinics will be crowded, I was able to get in and out without having excessive delays by avoiding peak times (go early mornings!)  They do care how long you are waiting and try to avoid situations where you have to wait for very long periods of time - which is more than I can say for the other 2 clinics I have been to  They now also have a text survey which enables you to tell them when the wait time is unacceptable and also provide other feedback as soon as your visit is over  I left feeling secure in his treatment plan for me and absolutely confident that I had come to the right place   Additionally, the nurses and administrative professionals at RMA NY Eastside are top notch  Ariel, a nurse I worked with often, went above and beyond to answer my many questions, and to guide me through the day-to-day of fertility treatment and early pregnancy  Truly, I have never felt so thoroughly cared for and confident in my doctor, nurses, and practice They ran blood test and put me on thyroid medication and told me to contact them when I lost the 16 pounds I contacted RMA on CD1 They never sent it, but not a problem I have to go in for bloodwork the next morning The nurse tells me she will send the clomid and contact me later in the day with the results of my blood work  The nurse calls me later in the day and says my blood work came back fine, but DrFlisser said I have a BMI of 45% and in needs to be below 40 %  The nurse said she will speak to him and call me back The nurses and Doctor out right LIED to me  A few weeks later, I received a voicemail from a nurse letting me know the ""embryo was mosaic and not viable and to call her with any questions  Between the packed waiting room where we had to stand because all the chairs were taken to the assembly line of blood work and ultrasound to sensitive test results being hastily left via voicemail without any explanation, to no subsequent follow up or call of any kind from the doctor, I decided I no longer wished to be a patient at RMA, as I had reached my limits with the factory approach to treatment, care and communication I had received, despite expending significant costs (both financial and emotional) throughout the process  We told them of the voicemail results mentioned above, and that we were unhappy with the service/communication protocols, and that we were taking our business elsewhere    He said he would pass it along to the doctor and his team Fast forward to almost a year later, when I received a voicemail from RMA letting me know that ""my free year of cryo preserve was up   To be clear, I still have the recording of the 2017 voicemail and nowhere did the nurse say that RMA intended on freezing my embryo and that I needed to call her back to discuss it   Of course, this had been paid long ago but the RMA billing office resubmitted it a second time  Yet another mess for us to clean up   I am posting my experience with the hopes that RMA take an extensive look at your staff, communication, and billing protocols I am still struggling with infertility to this day and it is not easy    However, my doctors and the staff at CCRM in both New York and Colorado have made a challenging situation bearable while providing the quality of care and communication unlike anything I experienced at RMA  I sent a version of this letter to ALL of the other doctors at RMA and have never received a responseI cannot day enough about my experience with RMANY Also, as someone from the medical field myself, I can appreciate the thoroughness and coordination of the office staff  The rest of their staff however, specifically billing is below standard  Fast forward 6 months later and my bills from RMA were much higher than beforeThis place caused many sleepless nights  I left his office in tears every Time   If you don't fit the profile don't bother with this place  I started off at another clinic and had the coldest, most traumatizing experience where I was treated as a number not a person  I later found out that Dr Copperman fought for my insurance company which represents city workers (teachers, firefighters, police officers) because he believed that those people deserved the support  This whole journey will never be easy, but working with the people at RMA make it bearableWe were  very happy at RMA Eastside After a bad experience at another clinic I felt very cared for at RMA Because they have several offices, I was able to go to a more convenient location except for when I needed to see my specific doctor which is a major plus for me Rma have great staff always answered all my questions and always called to touch base with me to see how everything is going and they are very professionalI didn't do much research when my doctor recommanded a list of places for IVF, I chose RMA because it was one of the center of excellence for my health insurance company, and also it is easy for commute as I work in the city  All my experiences in RMA had been mostly positive  One negative comment is that on the day of extraction, I had a reaction to the anesthesia (which I found out more when I delivered my baby), they rushed me out pretty quickly, I was one of the last patient for the day I thinkThis place is awful!!! DO NOT GO HERE FOR FERTILITY TREATMENTS!!  I made the mistake of doing so and I deeply regret it!  They are horrible to deal with in every way shape and form   Find some other place, any other placeI attended the Broadway office which was very clean, the waiting time was never over 10 min and everything went smoothly The waiting time was never over 10 min, and in each appointment we got his full attention All our questions were answered and we left the office very confident each time I hope this posts helps other peopleThe staff here is excellent They are some of the most sought after doctors and staff in the New York metro areaYou will be very happy with the service and results here This place is a factory, move onIf there was an option for ZERO stars that is what I would give RMA  The other Drs seem fine but one very old technician and nurses were awful and major attitude considering how much you payOverall, I wouldn't give this office a great rating Feels like a factory, and with check in visits I've had experiences where the doctor on duty made mistakes that clearly indicated they hadn't read my fileI was referred by my ObGyn to this office and when I called RMA office to schedule an appointment with a doctor for an initial consult and a possible ultrasound for a pain I have been experiencing!! THE RECEPTIONIST TOLD ME THEY HAVE NO ONE AND JUST HUNG UP THE PHONE!!!  I feel the pain of every couple who is suffering through IVF, and particularly those who did not have success as we did But I must emphatically say, with my one little personal experience, that RMA does everything it can to make it happen for all of its clientsMy husband and I had an excellent experience with RMATerrible service and dubious business practices! They sent me bills for things I had already paid for No explanation provided Customer service sucks You just show up for your appointments and leave Walk in, walk out, like machines My first experience at RMA was great  My second experience was the total oppositeIn the past two years, on  at least three different occasions they billed me for services and fertility treatments I never had on dates I never even went to their office  2 years later, I get a third bill when I have moved on to another doctor and have vowed never to use this practice againI can only feel terrible for those trying to conceive and what they might be billed at this office or if they are confusing patients regularly with their records Check your bills, they might be charging you for services you never even had RMA was the last and worst The billing is beyond terribleWhy they even hired that kind of people There's lots of better places in NYCRMA is like a high volume uncaring infertility factory who's primary focus is getting money from their desperate clients But RMA can bill for them- so they advocate for them and do themDespite making millions from their patients, their computers have gone down for 8 hours at a time and they provide horrible customer service Or go NYU- go anywhere but here for your fertility needsThe worst clinic as just as big as the big hospitals Drs are good but the staff is irresponsible, often overbook appointments and you end up waiting forever They treat people as a number for something so personal as fertility The only reason I come here is because my OBGYN respects this place, they have lots of traffic and see many cases, their stats are good! That said I wish I had the choice of another place This is by far the worst clinic I have visited for so many reasons- they are greedy, try to over charge you for everything All the care about is the money nothing else this is like a cow factory! For me the lack of personal attention was also an issue My medical coordinator messed up a cycle leaving me waiting another month without even apologizing hate this place so much  However, as I continued my treatment, I began to realize it is actually a well oiled machineThe staff was great  They were respectful and comforting  Special mention to Miriam, the financial coordinator, who really goes above and beyond her job description but I felt that ALL were smart, competent and trustworthy Very organized and professional This is very impressive We had horrible experience at Cornell where the nurse would not call you back for 2 weeks with results and forget about a doctor They run it as a business which is fine with me Also, Saturday monitoring wait is a bit long and I don't think I needed as many blood test as I did I wish I could give 4 I run a dental office myself so appreciate the organization and professionalism The staff pays attention, and the follow up is great I'm shorting them one star because the billing is confusing as all hell, but ultimately after a long hard journey we had success due to the care and expertise of Dr Mukherjee and his team The doctors answer your emails even on the weekends and in the evenings!!  The front staff are great too We had such a bad experience at RMA A year later and a baby later! I will be working with him againRMA is just a money making business and the minute you tell them that you cannot afford IVF you just get ignored  They are not accommodating and overcrowded  I understand that for some women, the crowded waiting rooms and ""cattle call"" feel of the early morning monitoring hours might not be ideal  For me, I was happy to be seen by doctors who do this all the time and whose office runs like a well-oiled machine  If you get there on the early side, the wait isn't long at all  When I was too chicken to give myself a really simple injection that was meant to be administered at home, they were more than happy for me to bring it to them for a nurse to give me, and I was in and out in five minutes  I wasn't a patient long enough to really get to know any of the nursing staff -- but I can't think of a better compliment to a fertility clinic than ""I wasn't there long enough to be able to commentSad to say it, but here's another negative review Called me own doctor who confirmed they were faxed  They did and found the fax  No one at RMA told me that  Their doctors have great reputations but the office side of this operation needs a serious overhaul I've gone to the White Plains and NYC locations They acted like I should have already known all the steps in what is actually a pretty complicated process So when I came in for an IUI, they didn't tell the nurse that I was there and I had the sample for a LONG time I started stressing b/c they tell you they need it within an hour I stopped going for a few months and have been so much less stressed that I would never go back I had a ""IVF class"" with one of the nurses and man, she was AWFUL Their billing practices are also extremely suspect I am STILL getting bills for random items, dating all the way back to Feb I caught a double billing and now don't trust any of what they've sent meWhen working with the team at RMA, I found that I always received prompt attention, whether that be on the phone (weekday and even on weekends), when speaking with nurses and being seenAbsolutely awful They were all smiles and help when our money was flowing to them like water ""Sorry, we can't see you,"" the nurse told me coldly as my wife was bleeding and cramping Shame on this horrible placeThis  review is only for the office staff not the physicansI find it very difficult to comunicate with staff ,  i constantly have the ""factory feeling "" I am very grateful to the RMA staff and the various doctors that I worked with For me this was the most efficient way to get the care I needed Everything has a system and it works The doctors are the best at what they do and the nurses are all lovely Everyone who works there is so inappropriately dressed that it actually made me uncomfortable The ebst was when a women dressed to go to gym(a nurse) walked over to the girl next to me and started discussing how her treatment failedoh they also made a women with a child move to a different waiting room simply bcs she had a child and it wasn't rght to be around people without any He was all over the place She seems like she hates being there She was horrible Overall bad experience His expertise and compassion can not be beatAs many people here I had an issue with the financial department: they messed up in the very beginning Doctor Sandler, all the lab technicians and nurses were more than helpful I have never seen such attentive medical stuff elsewhereUnderwhelming experience, highly disorganized and no one is on top of anything I think he is a great doctor, but his staff is not always great, and they are the ones who make the difference in the day-to-day experience there Their finance dept was totally confusing, and once you get into the whole IVF thing, FINANCE is a big big deal The IVF coordinator was nice, but needed a lesson in controlled expectations: she told us three separate times that we were ""ready to go"" only to be told that day that our insurance hadn't approved us, or that the IVF lab was closed during the month that we were supposed to go through the process that was really stressfulWe are incredibly happy that we are now pregnant, and Dr Stein is great; the billing/finance dept is really lacking, and the other staff is hit-or-miss, and makes an already-stressful experience worse than it has to be  I see that many people have negative reviews regarding the practice being like a ""factory""  While it's true that RMA is a very large practice that runs like a well-oiled machine, that was a positive in my book Bloodwork and other tests are turned around with amazing speed (which is necessary in this area of medicine) and although the crowds in the waiting room can be scary at times (esp on weekends) they move things along with surprising speed and efficiency Horrible staff (except nurses) The billing staff made mistake after mistake with insurance Set me back months! Feels terrible going to a place where the people who are supposed to care for you at such an important time just want to take your money and remind you of this fact in their medical neglect and alternately omnipresent collections I felt as if switching to RMA was part of my journey (tests that hadn't been preformed for the past 2 years at another ""replicable nyc fertility clinic Waited twice for over an hour past my appointment time to see him to no avail Have to wait weeks for simple lab results email This place is a jokeWhile I'd like to say positive things about this practice, the experience leaves a lot to be desired Having a fancy office in a fancy Manhattan location does not make for a good practice This practice did not send any records after multiple requests over the phone and in writing! Comically, a large packet showed up almost a YEAR later when we'd forgotten everything about it along with a bill for $79 This practice is a money chasing practice that has long forgotten any morals or patient centered care It gives medicine and healthcare a bad name The practice is a pain to deal withHad a great experience with RMAI wish I could give this place a better review, having spent so much time and money herebut I have to agree with the others about it being a cold, emotionless place    I went from one of the kindest fertility clinics in the city, Sher Institute, to one of the most callous ones, RMA, because I needed to do donor eggs (Sher doesn't do that)  RMA does NOTHING to help ease that    I'm happy for the people that found success with RMA, and I suppose my review would be better if I didn't miscarryI am deeply resentful of RMA I 100 percent agree with earlier reviewers who have claimed that it is a factory It is almost impossible to actually speak to a doctor, and while some nurses (Carrie) are great, most of the others seem like they rented their lab coats from a costume shopI also find it enraging that they cannot print and mail me an itemized bill like a human being, and instead announce in front of the entire waiting room how much I owe The place is run like a factory - efficient yes, but cold The nurses who have helped me have been mediocre, at best To date I have had the nurses forget to refer my follow-up questions to the doctor on four separate occasions, give me contrary instructions about when to have intercourse after taking FSH drugs, and screw up an important prescription (first forgot to call it in and then, because it was after hours and I needed the injection that night, made me race around town to get to a pharmacy that has the drug and pay out of pocket, because that pharmacy was not within my insurance's coverage, but it was the only place I could get the drug, or I would have had to waste another cycle of eggs) I'm sure this place has been great for many people, but I would not recommend them to any of my friends and felt like I owed it to other women to write this reviewIt is unbelievable how bad the white plains office is being run They are unorganized, no customer service They have good and bad days but mostly bad From the nurse to the receptionist to billing  Going through a process that is so sensitive this place should feel welcoming but it's notI think the NY office of RMA is amazing  There was one nurse I found cold, but she was absolutely the exception  I was surprised by all the negative reviews Going through IVF is an emotional roller coaster and I found the staff to be as pleasant and helpful as possible You'd be crazy to go anywhere else! You're in and out and are not always seen by the doctor (although you are still largely seen by the same 3-4 people)  That's exactly what I'm receiving from RMA and I'm very happy  But if you've been at this for a while and know the drill, this place will make you very happy/comfortable  This morning I saw a doctor for less than 60 seconds, and when i needed to ask him a question about a prescription, he cut me off and told me ""the nurse will handle it"" and out the door he went  Later, when I spoke with the nurse and told her that there had been multiple screw-ups with sending my Rx to my insurance company to get filled, she hands me a new Rx and tells me ""why don't you just take it to a local pharmacy and if you have to just pay out of pocket, it's not going to break the bank, it's only $128  I did just that, and when the nurse called me just now to tell me to continue my current dose,  i asked ""wait, i was only instructed to take it for 3 nights You mean I was supposed to continue through last night?""  With the snootiest of tones she said ""Well that must've been a misinterpretation on YOUR part  I will complete this cycle with RMA and then will switch to another practiceDO NOT GO THERE, IT IS A FACTORY AND THERE IS NO CONTINUITY OF CARE  But, their customer service responses were often slow and less responsive The office is unorganized and it's impossible to get someone on the phone For a practice that handles such sensitive work I am SO disappointed with the lack of compassion in the receptionists and the whole office While checking out at the NYC office the receptionist were laughing with one another and socializing And I don't understand why the phone number directs you to the Brooklyn office instead of the New York office I would live to speak with a supervisor of the NYC location and notify the doctors of my disappointment in the way that the office is run","Great practice with a kind, knowledgable team Covid interrupted our IVF process and they were great about sharing updates and keeping us informed . - Dr Sandler and his team is especially nice and efficient! Some people may not like that you see different doctors for monitoring while in cycle; I personally didn't mind because the office is very efficient and I was usually in and out of monitoring in ~30 minutes or less . Nurses like Krista and the IFV coordinator Kiran made our lives so much easier while we went through everything . It was always easy to get in touch with billing with our many questions . We had even been to a different fertility clinic prior without any positive results . From our Doctor, Dr Grunfeld, and his team - front desk reception, nurses, coordinators billing department etc - everyone was extraordinarily helpful and friendly . I found that at RMA everyone was sensitive to what we were going through and I had a great experience despite our circumstances . I like that they have a central coordinator for each patient who you can reach out to with any questions - again, other clinics did not have this and you had to deal with different nurses all the time, most of who had no idea who you were or your background . A few weeks later, I received a voicemail from a nurse letting me know the embryo was mosaic and not viable and to call her with any questions . We told them of the voicemail results mentioned above, and that we were unhappy with the service/communication protocols, and that we were taking our business elsewhere . Of course, this had been paid long ago but the RMA billing office resubmitted it a second time . However, my doctors and the staff at CCRM in both New York and Colorado have made a challenging situation bearable while providing the quality of care and communication unlike anything I experienced at RMA . The rest of their staff however, specifically billing is below standard . Fast forward 6 months later and my bills from RMA were much higher than beforeThis place caused many sleepless nights . If you don't fit the profile don't bother with this place . I started off at another clinic and had the coldest, most traumatizing experience where I was treated as a number not a person . DO NOT GO HERE FOR FERTILITY TREATMENTS!! . I made the mistake of doing so and I deeply regret it! . They are horrible to deal with in every way shape and form . The other Drs seem fine but one very old technician and nurses were awful and major attitude considering how much you payOverall, I wouldn't give this office a great rating Feels like a factory, and with check in visits I've had experiences where the doctor on duty made mistakes that clearly indicated they hadn't read my fileI was referred by my ObGyn to this office and when I called RMA office to schedule an appointment with a doctor for an initial consult and a possible ultrasound for a pain I have been experiencing!! My second experience was the total oppositeIn the past two years, on . at least three different occasions they billed me for services and fertility treatments I never had on dates I never even went to their office . That said I wish I had the choice of another place This is by far the worst clinic I have visited for so many reasons- they are greedy, try to over charge you for everything All the care about is the money nothing else this is like a cow factory! However, as I continued my treatment, I began to realize it is actually a well oiled machineThe staff was great . The front staff are great too We had such a bad experience at RMA A year later and a baby later! I will be working with him againRMA is just a money making business and the minute you tell them that you cannot afford IVF you just get ignored . They are not accommodating and overcrowded . I understand that for some women, the crowded waiting rooms and cattle call feel of the early morning monitoring hours might not be ideal . For me, I was happy to be seen by doctors who do this all the time and whose office runs like a well-oiled machine . review is only for the office staff not the physicansI find it very difficult to comunicate with staff , . While it's true that RMA is a very large practice that runs like a well-oiled machine, that was a positive in my book Bloodwork and other tests are turned around with amazing speed (which is necessary in this area of medicine) and although the crowds in the waiting room can be scary at times (esp on weekends) they move things along with surprising speed and efficiency Horrible staff (except nurses) The billing staff made mistake after mistake with insurance Set me back months!

Going through a process that is so sensitive this place should feel welcoming but it's notI think the NY office of RMA is amazing . There was one nurse I found cold, but she was absolutely the exception . You're in and out and are not always seen by the doctor (although you are still largely seen by the same 3-4 people) . That's exactly what I'm receiving from RMA and I'm very happy . This morning I saw a doctor for less than 60 seconds, and when i needed to ask him a question about a prescription, he cut me off and told me the nurse will handle it and out the door he went . i asked wait, i was only instructed to take it for 3 nights You mean I was supposed to continue through last night? . I will complete this cycle with RMA and then will switch to another practiceDO NOT GO THERE, IT IS A FACTORY AND THERE IS NO CONTINUITY OF CARE ."

26,RMA of New York,cost," Although no one wants to pay for fertility ;) their finance team was also great! I never had to call insurance to fight a bill, as everything was explained in detail to me by the team They will call and make sure they get paid and threaten to cancel everything  unless they are paid in full I've spent 45 minutes max and 20 at the least here (** in total, which includes wait times for gynecologists post bloodwork and any Q&A) We did get some wildly incorrect information about our out-of-pocket costs from the young woman we spoke to in the finance department (she told us everything would be covered but we ended up owing about $8,000 per cycle for drug costs), but it seems she was let go soon after our conversation (unrelated to us, but I am guessing she did this to others) and the finance supervisor was really great about working with us to come up with a payment planLastly, they were very hands on in helping me navigate my insurance He ordered a series of expensive tests which were not covered by insurance and kept asking me to use donor eggs even though I produced Grade AA embryos Jo Anne, who works in billing, always assists me immediately with requests whether it be paying my balance or paid invoice requests on top of that, i received a bill for 10% of what my insurance paid My insurance paid generously for this horrible service that i received My insurance covers EVEYTHING, and I refuse to have my money given to a practice that deceives patients   Low and behold my husband and I just received a notice from our insurance company regarding a claim submitted from RMA for $10k for my first round of IVF in January of 2017  When we first came to RMA, my insurance was In-Network  RMA decided that my insurance plan would no longer be In Network, yet never notified me   I'm about 20 lbs overweight I could lose a few but that was extreme Then we sat down with the finance person who told us bc my husband had been voluntarily sterilized insurance wouldn't cover anything Not one test or anything was ever submitted to insurance to even see if this was confirmed It was only after going to another clinic that we found out ivf was indeed covered by our insurance and that all I needed was a letter of medical necessity due to male infertility We haven't paid anything this second round I believe they didn't want to go through insurance so they could get all of the money up front from us It was dropped by my insurance, so I have since stopped going to this doctor They billed me incorrectly for $13,000 for procedures done 10 months before and failed to correct the error- despite me contacting the insurance company and providing them with necessary documentation to correct the error The doctors were so rude & they treated us like cattle! Stay away from RMA!!! Sher institute takes GHI IN NETWORK!!!!

I never had to call insurance to fight a bill, as everything was explained in detail to me by the team They will call and make sure they get paid and threaten to cancel everything . Low and behold my husband and I just received a notice from our insurance company regarding a claim submitted from RMA for $10k for my first round of IVF in January of 2017 . When we first came to RMA, my insurance was In-Network . RMA decided that my insurance plan would no longer be In Network, yet never notified me .

33,Weill Cornell Medicine - Center for Reproductive Medicine,cost," There was no cancer But I have no such issue and this was unbearably painful!I would have gladly paid for some pain killers with cash  These clowns sent a debt collector after me for an $8 bill that I paid!   What they do is criminaland these jerks are still sending me bills for tests they performed 16 months ago, that they claim my insurance wouldn't coverI spent a year at Cornell doing various procedures I encountered every issue possible there - overpaying out of pocket, being double billed when I changed plans, being over treated (which resulted in excessive costs), misquoted prices, bills sent to collections when I had outstanding credit balances with them (for being overcharged for services insurance covered) Just received an EOB from my insurance saying Cornell submitted a claim in October 2017 for $1500 for my HCG  I was already billed for this procedure and my insurance  paid the claim last June Seriously??? Luckily, my insurance denied this year and a half old claim At the time of appointment, they said they accepted my insurance What kind of gotcha is that, to say you take the insurance because technically, you can bill the insurance, but you're not actually an in-network provider?2 They will NOT help you out at all with insurance I paid out of pocket for many meds that were actually covered So transparent about billing and potential costs - You can't reach your doctor even if you have an emergency- My insurance covers lab tests, but their blood tests were not covered because they don't send your tests to a lab - they do them in-house! Nobody ever explained me that I had about 10 tests within a month and, eventually had to pay $300 our of my pocket (while it would have been free at many other places)- Two times they made a mistake in taking the right blood test They made a mistake twice on ordering the incorrect quantity of medicines, which were cover by my insurances Because of their mistake, i had to pay an extra 500 usd at the pharmacy  for medicines that will have cost me 50 usd if ordered properly  My insurance covers the doctor's services, but not the Center for Reproductive Medicine We had two IVFs, the first paid by the insurance while the second was paid by us (with some stuff paid by insurance)","There was no cancer But I have no such issue and this was unbearably painful!I would have gladly paid for some pain killers with cash .

35,CCRM Fertility New York,doctor,"As pleasant as fertility treatment can be: an opinion shared by my wife and meDr Choi is an absolute gem, and is very clear and direct about treatment options and the state of play Excellent bedside manner: that perfect blend of kindness and humor with a clinical efficiency in communication Couldn't recommend her more highly, and I only wish she were a GP so I could use her as MY doctor Dr Knopman treated us thoughtfully, explaining things clearly and tweaking things as needed to make sure we had the best results She is warm, caring and so positive I always felt like everyone was rooting for us and doing everything they could for us to be successfulWe came to Dr Levine after trying to conceive for several years without much success Dr Levine is a physician and scientist, and he found the right way to communicate with both my husband and me from the very beginning He explained things in great detail and at no point, I felt confused about the process or about the next steps Dr Levine's approach to our case was personalized and data-driven He cited up to date studies pertaining to the procedures we were involved in and was very thorough and knowledgeable in answering all the questions I had about the whole processDr Levine performed my egg retrieval procedure, which was flawless I experienced minimal side effects and there were much more eggs retrieved than I anticipatedDr Levine is very well connected and has amazing contacts in the NYC area  Dr Levine's skills, combined with his sense of humor and vast experience make it easy and fun to work with him, which is incredibly important given how stressful fertility journeys can getDr Choi reviewI found Dr Choi through a friend's rave recommendation, and I echo them after our experience Dr Choi is an incredible fertility doctor From the second you meet her, it's obvious you are about to have science and a true professional on your side But not only was she sympathetic to our situation and history, what hit me most was her determination to get to the bottom of it and optimism for putting us in the best possible position for a success But we always found comfort in her straight-forward way of explaining things, and felt empowered because we were getting all the facts We might have gone through even more years of disappointment, never knowing why We really felt taken care of and in good hands the whole way through So if you are looking for an incredible fertility doctor at a highly effective clinic, I recommend a consultation with Dr ChoiTheir attentive and concerned nature made me feel as if I was are their one and only patient  I felt secure and confident that whatever the outcome or situation they would take of me and that the outcome would be positive  CCRM gave us hope that we had all but lost More than that, it is clear they care about their patients which is so important during such a challenging time Dr Levine's approach is based on the individual needs of each patient not the standard cookie cutter protocol not to mention the lab quality is the absolute best We were able to achieve success in his care After 2 unsuccessful cycle with another facility I reached out to Dr Choi she is the best,  kind, compassionate and she take her time to listen and is very theral which we loved First try with her and here i am 12 weeks pregnant! Am so happy we have you in the infertility world As I read through these positive reviews, I can only guess that there are few negative reviews because AI write the below review after having the highest of hopes for this practice and utmost faith in the extremely intelligent staff that work there It started out great, I met with Dr Levine in their beautiful office after being referred by one of his friends who he went to medical school with Ironic this is the case because you would think my experience would be stellar given this fact Dr Levine impressed me with his credentials and background It didn't work that month so on December 18, 2018 Dr Levine called me and left me a voicemail around 4:45pm (apparently to discuss next steps for my next cycle) I called back immediately at 5:10pm that same day but the office was already closed so I followed up with an email to Dr Levine Stephanie called me at noon on the 19th and offered 4:30pm that same day to speak to Dr Levine She replied and in a really condescending way said ""No and if that doesn't work, he will not be able to speak to you until after the holiday"" They have given up on me and did not even have the courtesy  to let me know! I can tell anyone thinking about going to CCRM this: yes, they are highly qualified and intelligent doctors, however, they also have SO many patients and it doesn't always matter where they went to medical school I could provide other examples of why I believe this is true but it's not the point of my review I receive such personal treatment at my new practiceI could not recommend Dr Knopman and the entire staff at CCRM There are no words to express my gratitude to Dr Knopman She was truly amazing; a true expert in her field, took her time explaining every single detail My husband and I had been trying to conceive unsuccessfully for 13 months, and I had a terrible experience with an ob gyn who tried to treat me using guesswork out of his office instead of sending me to a specialist I remember crying after my first appointment with Dr Levine, because the experience was so different He treated me warmly and compassionately from the moment I stepped into his office He spent over an hour with me discussing not only my case history, but who I was a person, what I liked to do during my free time, how I had been feeling about my fertility issues, etc However, the point of this post is to emphasize how wonderful my experience was throughout my journey at CCRM (which I know would have continued to be wonderful if that first IUI had not been successful, and I needed to proceed to more invasive procedures): Let's start with Dr Levine, who is honestly the BEST Dr Levine explains everything extremely thoroughly and on repeat You hear the same message over and over again, and it's so reassuring and empowering, because you know the plan at all times He takes the time to chat and catch up, and we spent just as much time talking about different exercise classes we liked, restaurant recommendations, and LIFE as we did my fertility issues This may seem silly, but it really changed the dynamic of my treatment from negative to positive I looked forward to my appointments with Dr Levine because they were so fun, and I left feeling happy, confident, and taken care of as an individual Dr Levine gave me his direct e-mail, and he ALWAYS responded or called me back, even when I e-mailed late at night I will also never forget receiving a call from Dr Levine at 1pm on a Saturday, in between cycles, just to say ""Hey, how are you feeling about everything?"" Even better than Dr Levine? His nursing staff I know CCRM sees a lot of patients, but I was floored every time they recognized me and greeted me by name They were also my cheerleaders and coaches when I didn't get the results I wanted It made this milestone feel all the more special to me and my husbandThank you, Dr Levine and CCRM for everything! The incredible, compassionate work you do is so important and means the world to patients like me Our doctor, Dr Levine was incredible throughout the whole process, answering all of our many questions, being accessible via email and phone, and explaining everything (which i wanted)  Throughout the process i  met all of the other doctors (Dr Choi, Dr Knopman, and Dr Talebian) and they were all wonderful and kind!My husband and i couldn't be happier to have met Dr Brian Levine and CCRM Within 3 months we were pregnant on our first try! He is not only a wonderful doctor, but he is confident and caring  He makes you feel comfortable every step of the way Also, to note, while Dr Talebian was not the Doctor I met with on day one, she took great care in my case as well and treated me as one of her own Not enough words to thank Dr Levine Truly taking wonderful care of us!  They took the time to make sure each step was carefully understood,  ALWAYS available by email or call, Even checking on us after our procedureI cannot recommend this practice and Dr Levine enough  Dr Levine is the kindest, most caring doctor I have meet with He truly treats you like a human being and not another number I do not have enough words to wax poetic about Dr Levine and the practice  Dr Levine made miracles happen and we are so grateful for him and his staff I went from feeling like cattle at a fertility farm to customized personal attention, and most importantly, problem solving Most of all, Dr Choi is brilliant, willing to take the time to understand your medical history and answer every question you have, and genuinely cares about her patients I am a 35 year old woman that began thinking about freezing my eggs this summer I made an appointment at CCRM NY as a friend who visited their Colorado branch recommended it to me I have eggs in the freezer:) I always felt cared for, and they were flexible with my schedule I am a very ""difficult case"" infertility-wise, and my doctor (Dr Brian Levine) was incredibly persistent and attentive and kept trying different protocols until we finally started getting good results  As already mentioned by many of the reviewers, I'm not one to write reviews but given how stressful this process can be and how difficult it can be to find firsthand experiences, I feel it's important to offer my experience  To summarize my situation, as a 36 year woman, I had seen an advertisement from a clinic (with reputable doctors) who catered primarily to women looking to preserve their fertility versus going through the full IVF process  Within days I was meeting Dr Levine (with my mom) for the first time  My blood pressure was sky high!  But within minutes Dr Levine and his ENTIRE staff put me and my mother at ease  While they cannot guarantee I will have a child they made me feel immediately that even though I was ""only"" going through egg freezing, I was AS important as every other woman there and my care and comfort was of the utmost importance  I could simply go on and on about the care and medical attention I received by Dr Levine and his team  What was one of the most anxiety filled experience of my life actually ended up being one filled with true warmth and caring and honestly I sort of miss going there and seeing everyone everyday :)  The last bit I want to mention is that if it were not for this experience I also would not have discovered another medical situation and with Dr Levine's care I have been able to get treatment and feel SO fortunate that to this day I can still email him DIRECTLY and he will get back to me with either a phone call or email within hours  Never in my life have I received the attention and care that Dr Levine and CCRM's entire staff providesI wish I could more emphatically recommend Dr Levine because honestly my experience at CCRM and the practice he runs has been life changing for me Everyone from the front desk receptionists, to the nurses, to Dr Levine, made you feel like you were entering their living room rather than a doctor's office Dr Levine is truly a one-of-a-kind person He is extremely intelligent (goes without saying), caring, compassionate and highly invested in his patients On our very first visit, he knew everything about me and my medical history before I even had to speak! He not only takes the time to get to know his patients personally, but he uniquely designs each treatment plan to meet the individual needs of the patient You are NOT a number with him, but rather a human being He made himself available to me via email 24/7 and would respond almost immediately My husband and I couldn't be more grateful for the compassion, patience and time he has given us  Ultimately, I felt like CCRM treated me like a walking blank check, bolstering a fear of the unknown to get me to opt into an expensive, out of pocket elective procedure I simply wanted to learn more about (and would have agreed to if I felt they actually cared about me)  Cost aside, while I applaud CCRM's efficiency, the lack of given time to process, understand my options and why certain things were needed, and digest what was happening felt very wrongI'll begin with her medical expertise: Doctor Choi is the most skilled, knowledgeable physician I have ever met  And while incredibly impressive, it is the kindness, care, decency, and humanity of how she does what she does that sets Dr Choi apart from her peers Not emotionally, not financially, not physically The process is like a soup made of your bones and heart Dr Choi, the physician, is, as I said earlier, a master of the physical processes of reproductive medicine Dr Choi, the healer, is a sterling human being whose ability to gently explain every aspect of the fertility process to her patients; to soothe and sympathize with her patients; to take care of her patients' emotions as much as their bodies, is deeply movingDoctor Choi: I cannot thank you enough for your insight, care, compassion, and dedication What's even more rare is a doctor who is so personable and positive He treats you like a friend and not just another patient he has to deal with I first met Dr Choi at Columbia a couple years ago when I had my eggs frozen She was amazing and brilliant I continued at Columbia but this time with a male doctor who I disliked immensely I decided to stop moving forward with the process until I found a doctor and a place that I likedI would highly, highly recommend this place to anyone considering IVF/ egg freezing, fertility options, etc! The doctors and nurses here are beyond AMAZING, personable, intelligent and kind I have seen three of the doctors here and they are all fantastic with great bedside manner Besides being brilliant Dr Choi is incredibly patient, explaining different options again and again until I understand It has been especially nice to have a doctor that truly cares about her patients She couldn't be at my egg retrieval but called the night before to check in and then again on the day of retrieval to make sure I was feeling ok The nurses went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable and feel taken care ofDr Brian Levine is responsible for my 3 1/2 year old daughter Willa, and after trying for almost 2 years at Cornell, luck found me in his capable hands again!I can not explain how discouraged, frustrated and just down I felt after my experience at Cornell Now to the Doctors! I almost always saw Dr Levine which was not the case at Cornell ( if I was lucky I saw my dr once or twice a cycle) If Dr Levine was busy with a procedure I saw Dr Choi or Dr Talabian who knew me by name and actually remembered me on my next visit They were familiar with my situation and just wonderful (He even gave me his cell phone number) Dr Levine was always there to perform my procedures and explain  everything step by step I have never met a lovelier, more knowledgeable, more positive doctor We saw Dr Levine and he was able to diagnose our issues and set a clear course of action He was always incredibly personable, energetic and available for any and all questions that arose And he was able to help us get pregnant, which is of course the reason we were there in the first place! The entire staff is amazing -- everyone was warm, welcoming and very attentive to your personal situation I cannot say enough about Dr Choi and the staff as whole After our first appointment, we left feeling calm and excited about the path we had chosen The staff at CCRM is extremely caring and involved in your treatment experience She is very thorough and determined to help you accomplish whatever you came to her for and will support you along the way Dr Janet Choi is professional, thorough, compassionate, patient and kind -- all the key ingredients to help hormonal women going through a process that is putting our most treasured organs at possible risk They made me feel known and cared for every step of the way My results were very successful and I believe it was due to the thoughtful care and great communication of the entire staff, led by Dr Choi Dr Levine was my doctor but all of the staff and doctors knew me by first name and always showed a genuine interest in my progress and care After having gone to a different clinic with two failed retrievals, I was successful with Dr Levine on my first retrieval and first transfer Even after being discharged to an OB, Dr Levine continued to answer my questions without hesitation and in a very timely fashion I wish all of my doctors in all treatment areas were as good and helpful as Dr LevineThere are no words to express how lucky I feel to have been a patient of Dr Knopman and at CCRM  At each step along the way, Dr Knopman was there to help me and to guide me through  Dr Knopman shows extraordinary attention to each patient and provides tailored and individualized care  Infertility is a scary and nerve-racking process to begin with, and Dr Levine made it incredibly less so  He was personable from the beginning  Everyone from Dr Levine to the nurses, reception etc were incredible  IVF can be a daunting process , but Dr Levine's group are wonderful at keeping your stress  to a minimumI had an incredibly positive experience here I felt empowered and informed throughout the process Everything, absolutely everything, was customized to me as an individual human, from the protocols to the way we made decisions about my care He even considered psychological and emotional effects of certain decisions, and not just treatment by the numbers and the probabilities There was no detail that went unnoticed to him, and his nuanced care is truly a gift The center itself, and especially the surgical wing, felt like a spa for my ovaries (literally--there were warmed blankets, spa music, plants and succulents","I felt secure and confident that whatever the outcome or situation they would take of me and that the outcome would be positive . kind, compassionate and she take her time to listen and is very theral which we loved First try with her and here i am 12 weeks pregnant! His nursing staff I know CCRM sees a lot of patients, but I was floored every time they recognized me and greeted me by name They were also my cheerleaders and coaches when I didn't get the results I wanted It made this milestone feel all the more special to me and my husbandThank you, Dr Levine and CCRM for everything!

36,CCRM Fertility New York,advice," As an academic myself, this was very important to me, as I knew I didn't have time to read all the relevant scientific literature on the protocols and procedures we were about to experience The pre-op and post-op communication was amazing He also recommended a long list of great OBGYNs at graduation and made sure I checked out to an OBGYN he trusted upon graduation I recommended Dr Levine to everything I knew was struggling with fertility (at other clinics) If you're considering seeing a fertility specialist, do not hesitate to give CCRM-NY (and Dr Levine in particular) a chance We had been through a lot by the time we came to CCRM, as I'm sure is true for many fertility patients She talks fast for sure, but gets right to the point, and isn't afraid to trust her patients with information A lot of doctors will hold back because they think too much of the technical stuff will be confusing or go above your head Her direction and diagnosis were the keys to unlocking our fertility challenges Tackling infertility is naturally a really emotional and personal experience Even when another doctor (Dr Levine) was filling in to keep us on schedule, it was obvious they were in communication with each other and checking in behind the scenes No matter what you are facing, it's worth a conversationThanks to the whole staff I am pregnant and expecting a baby!I wish I could stay with them though out my 9 months!!!!  It was the best decision we could have made We can never truly thank Dr Levine and CCRM for everything they have done for our family) Women are too nervous to post something negative in fear they could be jinxed or something (The want to get pregnant sometimes overpowers everything else) He talked a lot about himself (he's a runner, how he wakes up at 4am every day and his morning routine, what he eats to stay healthy) My initial  impression was that he was slightly arrogant but maybe he was entitled to be- I mean this guy has a really impressive background and I wanted him to be my doctor I don't blame CCRM for this outcome and I don't and didn't expect CCRM to work miracles It's shocking and disgusting I tried this in the month of November, 2018 I had an already-scheduled meeting at that time with my CEO at work so asked if there was any other time that could work or any other day, that I would make myself available but just that specific time wasn't possible for me I reiterated the importance of me not being able to miss a meeting with my CEO and asked if she could at least find out what Dr Levine needed, if it was urgent or if there was anyone else, (perhaps a nurse) that I could speak to instead Stephanie told me she would ask Dr Levine and call me back Today is February 5th (over a month later) and I have yet to hear back from anyone at CCRM There are so many other important factors when choosing a fertility doctor- like choosing someone with empathy Everyone knew my name the second I entered their officeApologies in advance for the long review, but my experience with Dr Levine and CCRM was so wonderful it deserves an essay: I can't express exactly how nervous I was to begin fertility treatment with a specialist I won't go into all the details, but this experience had been totally inhuman, awful, and ineffective He didn't rush me, and he repeatedly allowed there to be pauses so I could ask more questions Dr Levine also has the most fun personality Dr Levine and his team wrote everything down for me, always I know this seems so simple, but I can't tell you how reassuring it was to have a plan and to have that plan documented in writing Months of frustration with the ""factory"" at RMA NY, everything changed when we walked into CCRM and met Dr Brian Levine Instantly impressed at our first appointment, Dr Levine had already thoroughly researched , highlighted and took notes on our case Before even talking with us, he'd already discovered i was misdiagnosed previously and didn't take lightly how easy my case looked on paper being ""young and healthy"" Everything went exactly as planned from that moment Always a quick email away, no matter how silly or insignificant a question He is truly an amazing, intelligent doctor CCRM is truly the best team there is  Dr Levine was always praising his team, because they deserve it! We don't know how we could've done this without them THANK YOU TO THE VERY BEST THERE IS! Having been on a roller coaster ride and through multiple practices and doctors I can say with the most conviction this is the BEST place to help you on your path to parenthood  Dr Levine truly GETS how hard this journey is and is emphatic and human to guide you not just through the medical but also the emotional and mental aspects They are truly the BEST and I would recommend this place to my family and friends if they were on this fertility journey  They are real true blessings!The best medical decision I have ever made was switching from RMA to CCRM, and choosing Dr Choi She is hands down the best doctor I have ever had The fertility journey can be hard, but having the right doctor made it manageableFirst off, I would like to say that I am a lover of yelp but admittedly don't write enough reviews, compared to how much I use it CCRM certainly deserves one and I am so surprised I am the first one I figured I would check them out and then a few other known hospitals to see where I felt the most comfortable All of my questions/concerns were always answered and I never felt silly for asking anything I'm sorry if I missed your name, I tried to keep track of all of you:) I highly recommend CCRM to anyone, even if it's just a thought Freezing my eggs and choosing CCRM is one of the best decisions I have ever made! Dr Talabean did my retrieval and I trust her implicitly She was extremely honest and also prepared me for the recovery Since I had so many eggs, my recovery was a bit more intense than if someone had only a few You can be sure that they will take good care of youFirst and foremost, I cannot more highly recommend CCRM, in particular Dr Levine  Upon receiving my results, I soon was confronted with the reality that I may not have any fertility to preserve to put it lightly  I immediately called and try to get immediate appointments with NYU, Weill Cornell  After speaking with friends who had gone through the IVF process, I was advised how important it was to find a lab and doctor with the data to back up their results  In doing my due diligence I of course went to CCRM's website as their work in Denver speaks for itself  To say I was anxious is an extreme understatement  I thank them from the bottom of my heart  If you do ever find yourself facing fertility challenges, I would not hesitate to recommend Dr Levine I knew from the minute that I walked through the doors that my husband and I were in the best hands possible One of the BEST things about Dr Levine is how incredibly communicative he is I knew that no question was too small or insignificant to ask and if need be, he would call me just to make sure I was feeling okay about our course of action When our time was up with Dr Levine I was truly saddened! I strongly urge anyone seeking fertility treatment to see Dr Levine  While I had not yet made any decisions and was clear that I would not do so that day or be rushed into a commitment, most of the staff who met with me still assumed I was all in and tried to get treatments started and tests run, including ones I didn't understand the rationale behind   In a way, I blame lack of communication among the team versus an overly salesy attitude, but the net impact still wasn't favorable  The very last meeting was to walk through cost, so, I would have opted into all manner of procedures and drugs and only known the impact to my financial situation after I'd mentally committed  Bottom line: just have your wits about you if you go, and remember that you should ask as many questions as you need to get clarity and comfort with next steps  Last, be prepared - the consultation fee came out to about $200 higher than I was quotedI'm not entirely sure why I'm writing this here, on Yelp: somehow, I feel like this deserves more than the brevity of this site But I want everyone here to know this about Doctor Janet Choi so that others' lives may be changed as mine has been There was not a single instance where I doubted Dr Choi's skills: her medical care was considered, skillful, and assured It's brutal: a wild ride of fear, hope, dismay, euphoria, exhaustion, elation, resignation, determination, and outright ambiguity Doctor Choi is a marvelous doctor and an even more marvelous human being Your colleagues, Dr Levine; Lori; Whitney; Melissa; Jamie; Hunter; Elizabeth; Amanda; Gina; Stephanie; and all of your team will forever be in my mind and heartFrom the bottom of my heart, I thank youI spent a couple of years going to Cornell Reproductive Medicine and I finally walked away from them earlier this year after complete frustration I drained any coverage I had with Cornell and when I realized I was going to be paying for this out of my own pocket, I went looking for the best and CCRM is definitely that!! Dr Choi is AMAZING (I agree with the previous reviews) She spent more time with me in the few appointments I had with her than the doctor at Cornell did over the course of 2+ years I was there With fertility treatment, you are always on a roller coaster ride of emotions and CCRM sympathizes with that and gives their patients the necessary education, thought and time For anyone reading this, don't waste your time at Cornell - check out CCRM first! You are in and out of there! Communication is a breeze with them Dr Levine has made what could have been a daunting journey, a stress free and pleasant oneand here I am, now pregnant from my first IVF cycle! Take it from me who has struggled and wasted time at other clinics The quality of care at CCRM is top notch!! There is no need to go searching elsewhereA yelp from my daughter:I don't normally write Yelp reviews, but my experience at CCRM has been so phenomenal I felt compelled to write one I could always expect a follow up call from Dr Levine that evening ,even on weekends Unheard of at other practices Would absolutely recommend CCRM to anyone looking for any help with their fertility journeyMy husband and I had the absolute BEST possible experience at CCRM Dr Choi did numerous tests, she leaves no stone unturned, and helped us decided on the best possible plan of action to reach our goals They know your name, what is going on with you, and are there for absolutely anything you may need It is very clear that everyone at CCRM is passionate about helping people, no is ever in a bad mood! Dr Choi was always available to us whenever we had questions or concerns and truly enjoys her work She is honest but optimistic, which we found very refreshing As much as I hate western medicine, it made me consider doing another round! If you're looking for any fertility care, CCRM NY is 100% the place to go Overall, I would highly recommend Dr Levine and the entire CCRM NY team to anyone looking for top notch treatment Although I was at CCRM during a very difficult time in my life, the optimism, patience, compassion and kindness expressed by everyone there helped get me through it In particular, Dr Knopman was truly amazing and went above and beyond what I could expect from any doctor I am forever grateful for her professionalism, carefulness and for being one of the best doctors that anyone could hope for  I cannot say enough good things about him  Do not waste your time at other clinics, go straight to CCRM Dr Levine went above and beyond to make sure everything went as smoothly as possible Egg freezing is a daunting and arduous process but he made it more than worthwhile, I felt completely supported throughout and I walked away with an even better result than I had expected I'm so grateful and highly recommend CCRM to anyone who is looking for a great fertility doctorthank you CCRM you are all so awesome!CCRM NY, and Dr Levine, in particular, have changed the way I think about my healthcare in general, and I will truly never be the same The bar is permanently raised! He is the anti-paternalistic doctor to such an extent that I never could have imagined that a doctor-patient relationship could be this way He was truly my advocate and we were partnered in my care I wish he could be my doctor for everything under the sun, his team could manage all of my life, and I never have to see another doctor again I obviously cannot say enough good things about CCRM NY, and Dr Levine","It was the best decision we could have made We can never truly thank Dr Levine and CCRM for everything they have done for our family) Women are too nervous to post something negative in fear they could be jinxed or something (The want to get pregnant sometimes overpowers everything else) He talked a lot about himself (he's a runner, how he wakes up at 4am every day and his morning routine, what he eats to stay healthy) My initial . Dr Levine was always praising his team, because they deserve it! Having been on a roller coaster ride and through multiple practices and doctors I can say with the most conviction this is the BEST place to help you on your path to parenthood . Dr Levine truly GETS how hard this journey is and is emphatic and human to guide you not just through the medical but also the emotional and mental aspects They are truly the BEST and I would recommend this place to my family and friends if they were on this fertility journey . I immediately called and try to get immediate appointments with NYU, Weill Cornell . After speaking with friends who had gone through the IVF process, I was advised how important it was to find a lab and doctor with the data to back up their results . In doing my due diligence I of course went to CCRM's website as their work in Denver speaks for itself . I thank them from the bottom of my heart . I strongly urge anyone seeking fertility treatment to see Dr Levine . Dr Choi is AMAZING (I agree with the previous reviews) She spent more time with me in the few appointments I had with her than the doctor at Cornell did over the course of 2+ years I was there With fertility treatment, you are always on a roller coaster ride of emotions and CCRM sympathizes with that and gives their patients the necessary education, thought and time For anyone reading this, don't waste your time at Cornell - check out CCRM first! Dr Choi was always available to us whenever we had questions or concerns and truly enjoys her work She is honest but optimistic, which we found very refreshing As much as I hate western medicine, it made me consider doing another round! If you're looking for any fertility care, CCRM NY is 100% the place to go Overall, I would highly recommend Dr Levine and the entire CCRM NY team to anyone looking for top notch treatment Although I was at CCRM during a very difficult time in my life, the optimism, patience, compassion and kindness expressed by everyone there helped get me through it In particular, Dr Knopman was truly amazing and went above and beyond what I could expect from any doctor I am forever grateful for her professionalism, carefulness and for being one of the best doctors that anyone could hope for . I cannot say enough good things about him ."

38,CCRM Fertility New York,clinic,"Kind, patient, and accommodating staff that handles the logistics with precisionPristine well appointed officesI have been extremely pleased with CCRM Dr Knopman and all the staff, from the nurses to the front desk to the behind the scenes embryology team have not only provided me with top notch medical care, but they have done so with compassion The nurses (and I mean all of them, as there are different kinds) were always there with hugs and words of support when I needed it I am 9 weeks pregnant and moving on to be followed by an obstetrician and I am going to miss them all so much! (Take a pad and pen with you for notes!)I appreciated her thorough approach especially when it led to a discovery of a small growth in my pituitary And I am happy to report we are well into a healthy pregnancy (fingers crossed)! I can't say enough about the staff, who was so prompt answering our many many questionsI can't say enough about the stellar service I received at CCRM NY from the front desk the nurses and the every so important Doctors ( the amazing Dr Talebian was my doctor) right down to the billing department this is a team who love what they do and it showsWe feel like it was a true blessing to have started working with CCRM  After several failed IVF attempts at another clinic we traveled across the country based on a recommendation to work with CCRM NYC CCRM is incredibly efficient and very helpful Even though we were not living locally, we experienced the excellent communication from the entire staff and amazing support from Dr Levine himselfI am beyond happy CCRM is now in NYC! I don't know where to beginI was a patient at CCRM for over a year) The practice is new to NYC and B I was sold on him, the amazing office and the reputation of CCRM being affiliated with the CO office Quite literally, just never got in contact with me ever again when I was waiting to hear back about next steps Financially, my husband and I are still struggling to pay the 30K + in credit card bills we have left from CCRM He replied that same evening and added his Assistant, Stephanie so she could coordinate a time for us to speak the following day It's disgusting and so upsetting- especially after everything that I have been through with the struggle of infertility and the financial implications that come along with it They clearly know that I am no longer a viable IVF patient (their money-maker) In my experience, CCRM's main concern is money, not their patients  I have found a new practice (that I so far love by the way) They don't mess up bills, forget to prescribe drugs I need (like CCRM did for me twice) and my new doctor cares about me- not just taking my money  I had previously tried 2 other clinics and both felt like a factory But it was a whole different story with CCRM staff and Dr Knopman Their spa-like waiting room with snacks, relaxing music, coffee and tea provided such a comforting feeling during a very stressful time for me I never felt rushed or like a number as I did at other clinics Having a tight work schedule myself, I appreciated the fact that CCRM always took me in on time; that rarely happens in other practicesExcellent patient care is CCRM's top priority Lab work and scans can be scheduled very early in the morning which worked out perfect for me since I had to be at work by 8 am All the nurses knew me and were kept informed as to where I was in the process  For me, CCRM defines competency, compassion, professionalism, efficiency & courtesy He took what had been a terrible, chaotic, anxiety-inducing experience and turned it into a structured, calm, and unexpectedly FUN experience I remember receiving a call from him at 8pm, 2 minutes after I had e-mailed, when he was clearly in the middle of a family dinner They were so friendly and wonderful and reassuring, whether drawing blood, demonstrating how best to inject my Ovidrel trigger shot, or calling me to make sure I knew the next steps When I found out I was pregnant, everyone at CCRM was so genuinely happy for me, and I got so many different forms of congratulations5 stars is not enough for CCRM-NY After a previous experience at NYU, ccrm was a breath of fresh air AND TO THE AMAZING NURSING STAFF OF CCRM! Truly an integral part of the amazing care we had at CCRM  Specifically,  I worked most with Liz, Elana and Melissa;  but they all were outstanding nurses They really began to feel like family Their entire staff including the front desk and nurses are phenomenal The practice also has state of the art technology and you are getting the best care on that front tooDr Levine and the staff at CCRM are hands-down the best clinic in New York City  (and I am limiting myself to NYC because I have yet to venture out of the city for any treatments!) We were treated with love and respect at every visit and each appointment was timely and accommodating CCRM is on the cutting edge and a completely different experience My friend insisted that the place really has to make me feel good and at ease, if I was going to choose it for this procedure Needless to say, I walked into CCRM in August and didn't check out any other hospital after that visitThe staff is AMAZING!!!! From the front desk, to the nurses, to the business office and of course the Doctors! Everyone, and I mean everyone was sooo professional, kind, patient, helpful and positive The atmosphere is very tranquil and makes you feel at home I got 24 and I was monitored the entire process You must commit to going and getting blood work and ultrasound almost everyday or every other dayCCRM NY is absolutely fantastic -- excellent doctors, wonderful staff (including the embryology/lab team, nurses, administrative staff, everyone), a pristine lab, pleasant offices Working with them was an all around wonderful experience I had had a horrible previous egg-freezing experience with a different doctor and then came here, and it was night and day different -- and better, with CCRM I highly recommend CCRM NY  The first step was to get some bloodwork doneall the usual clinics  To my amazement they had just opened an office in NYCI don't even know where to begin with this review because there aren't enough good things to say about Dr Levine and the entire CCRM-NY team We were treated with love and warmth at every single visit, making it even harder to leave when our treatment was upI had really high hopes for this clinic, having read so many enthusiastic reviews and gotten references from friends  I waited over 30 minutes to meet with the doctor, who was curt, a little vague on why certain tests were needed but very decisive that the elective procedure was a must, and quick to shuttle me off to the start of at least 5 staff members I would meet during my time there  The only bright spot was one of the nurses - she was kind and empathetic, probably the only person who recognized that this was a voluntary visit  And, you don't have to sign on the dotted line That she is a graduate of Harvard and Columbia (where she also did her one of her two residencies, the other being at Cornell) would surprise no oneBut that's the ""easy"" part of what she does: the technical aspect of her professionTrying to have a child when you're over 40 isn't easy I love you all Between Dr Choi, the staff, the nurses, and the facility - they are all exceptionalAfter years of struggling with fertility and unsuccessful attempts at several other fertility clinics, I finally decided to travel out of town all the way to New York in order to start fresh at CCRM! As the other reviewers have already stated, there are not enough words to describe Dr Levine and ALL the staff at CCRM Everyone from the front desk receptionists, admin in the back office, phlebotomists, nurses, billing admin and doctors are the most caring, friendly, knowledgeable professionals you'll ever meet They treat you as if you are their only patient! Everyone at CCRM knows you by name and appointments are a breeze to schedule You rarely have to wait past your scheduled appointment time It's the same thing with the nurses I was especially thankful, going into this long distance The nurses emailed me all the necessary documents, sent prescriptions to my pharmacy out of town and just made the whole process as easy as possible! Speaking from my experiences at other clinics, all of the mentioned above is RARE This is the place to go! While doing research for another IVF clinic that didn't feel like a cattle call, I happened to find Dr Choi again, but this time she was heading up CCRM in NY I had heard that CCRM in Colorado was the best fertility clinic in the country and I was pleased to see that it was now in NYC as well I can not stress this enough It is a beautiful facility -- clean, welcoming, friendly front desk staff and calm, especially during a time that can be highly emotional and stressfulIf you are looking for a place to do IVF, THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO!!!!!! I can not say enough great things about Dr Choi, the other doctors here, the nurses and this clinic! Being a patient at CCRM was a whole new game From the lovely receptionists who greet you by name, to the amazing nurses who are always available to you, the staff at CCRM could not be more accommodating  There is not enough room here for me to sing CCRM's praises!!! I am due in September with my second daughter!!My experience at CCRM was wonderful Beyond the incredible staff and care, the space itself is brand new and beautiful -- feels like a spa, which helps add a calmness to the whole situation When we first came to CCRM, we were frustrated, scared, and confused I cannot recommend CCRM enough, their personalized approach not only makes an uncomfortable process more enjoyable, but also provides amazing resultsI can't speak highly enough of CCRM The entire team from receptionists to nurses to the team of doctors and business support were highly attentive & personalCCRM NY is amazing! Everyone from the front desk staff to all of the doctors far exceeded my expectations The facility itself is state of the art and super cleanDr Levine has been absolutely wonderful to work with (he's kind, funny, patient and wise beyond his years, he remembers very detail and always makes time for me when I need to ask him something, I feel safe under his care and blessed to have found him), as is Amanda in billing (helpful and full of knowledge, answering my endless questions and helping me understand both insurance and self-pay matters to figure out what's best for me), Plus all of the nurses (especially Ali who has been supportive and nurturing like a sister), and the receptionists (Stephanie's/Kate who brighten up the phone lines and office) It is a beautiful modern and clean space too White glove service without a doubt I actually went to NYU first for a consult- it was a disaster I felt like cattle and was totally ignored by all the support staff there despite the doctor seeming very good there too but all the rest of the staff gave me so much anxiety At CCRM it is a different and far better world, they humanize and personalize every moment Each person at CCRM - from the doctors to the nurses to the technicians to the staff - is absolutely incredible  You feel a part of the CCRM family immediately and the individualized attention they give each of their patients is unparalleledI first used another fertility clinic in NYC, but when I heard that CCRM was opening an office here, I switched immediately  And the nurses at CCRMwhere do I begin?!  They make you feel warm and welcome, even though you are scared and nervous  They ALL remember your name and are extremely efficient with bloodwork  Even the receptionist is welcomingI cannot say enough great things about CCRM new York I had spent too much time  with another practice that felt like a factory with a great deal of frustration before I found CCRM  Aside from their impressive credentials and top notch lab, their empathy and genuine care was amazing I can't say enough good things about him and his team--I met many of the other doctors, nurses and techs, and they were all phenomenal This place stands out above all the others that I researched Thank you CCRM!These group of physicians have the best success ratio, professional, personalized and compassionate in making our dreams come true It would not surprise me if he was thinking about every single patient outside of his office hours I would implore him to run workshops all over the world to teach doctors how to provide care like his My biggest piece of advice would be to run, don't walk, to CCRM tomorrow morning (and yes, you can likely get an appointment for tomorrow!!), and don't even think about seeing any other doctor or clinic","Kind, patient, and accommodating staff that handles the logistics with precisionPristine well appointed officesI have been extremely pleased with CCRM Dr Knopman and all the staff, from the nurses to the front desk to the behind the scenes embryology team have not only provided me with top notch medical care, but they have done so with compassion The nurses (and I mean all of them, as there are different kinds) were always there with hugs and words of support when I needed it I am 9 weeks pregnant and moving on to be followed by an obstetrician and I am going to miss them all so much!

39,CCRM Fertility New York,protocol," Because it was our first time seeing a RE, he started with a very thorough diagnosis procedure and recommended that we attempt IUI first, explaining to us the success rate of this procedure compared to the slightly more invasive IVF procedure After a few IUI attempts that were not working for us, he recommended that we move on to IVF, which we did, ultimately achieving success on our first embryo transfer As I developed thyroid issues early in my pregnancy he recommended a great list of endocrinologists that I could choose from, based on my health insurance coverage and preference I won't get too much into what happened specifically with my IVF's because in both cycles, my embryos were abnormal After my 2 failed IVF's Dr Levine suggested I try taking Clomid and either doing timed intercourse or an IUI Their approach is extraordinaryMost importantly I got pregnant with the first IVF Cycle I left my first appointment with a clear plan: we would start as non-invasively as possible, with a timed intercourse cycle (including Letrazole and an Ovidrel trigger shot, to maximize our chances) Over the next four months, my husband and I did three cycles of timed intercourse and then ramped up to an IUI at Dr Levine's suggestion Our first IUI was successful, and I am now 4 months pregnant with a baby girl!I was obviously thrilled with the outcome We were successful in our first ivf cycle at ccrm and are now 18 weeks pregnant After our first meeting, we were sure we were moving forward with our second IVF cycle and we couldn't have been happier from day one The process was made so easy, and I completed the cycle last week This is what makes them special; they cater the hormones based on your levels so if you're getting too much based on how your labs come back- they will either lower or increase your dose We now are 14 weeks pregnant, with additional healthy tested embryos preserved When I went to do IVF last year, she was no longer there I froze eggs in nov and going back to do another round next month What started off as consultation regarding ovulation ended up in a 9 month journey and a successful IVF transfer  He takes the time to recommend treatment that is specific to your case, and not just a textbook protocol It's been months and I bet he can remember the minutia and every single detail of my treatment and care","He takes the time to recommend treatment that is specific to your case, and not just a textbook protocol It's been months and I bet he can remember the minutia and every single detail of my treatment and care"

They really need to bone up on bedside manner and respectful treatment of womenI can't begin to explain how amazing my experience with DrT and his entire staff at Sher has been! I have a beautiful 2 year old son and am currently 6 months pregnant! Dr T and the staff at Sher are kind, patient, accommodating and at this point I consider them an extension of my family They take their time, actually listen and answer every question ( very late emails as well!) I can't recommend them enough- and I do to anyone going through this process! I could go on and on!!!! The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the dreadful billing department out of Las Vegas Each time I have these encounters I say to myself how much I ""hate this place"" and then I'm reminded of the care I receive from Dr Dicken and her patient coordinator Jacqueline Piccardo Some times I've had to reschedule meetings and another time Dr Dicken accommodated me despite the ridiculous appointment given for 8amThe two stars are what is left of my terrible experience with this clinic, if not for the responsive and attentive care that I receive from Dr Dicken and Jacqueline Piccardo I would give 0 stars (if possible)  I have never heard of anything like this  I don't think I can recommend this place to any of my friends that are looking to find out some information on fertility options to be left feeling cheated Anyhow I got a beautiful baby boy from Dr Wang and I am forever grateful to him and his team - the Dr are not reliableCan't say enough good things about Dr Dicken and the staff at Sher Dr Dicken is warm, caring, and super smart -- she's been willing to work with us through several failed IUIs, and now a successful IVF cycle Highly recommended!Dr T made it possible for me to get pregnantAfter two previously failed IVF treatments by two different RE I chose to go to Dr T because he looks into immune issues He never orders unnecessary tests and always reviews all of your records thoroughly before your initial consult You have 24/7 access to Dr T and trust me, he is the most patient human being out there! He will nonstop respond to all of my emails no matter what time of the day I send them He is so prompt with responses to email, and for a nervous person like me this is ideal Dr T will be the only doctor on top of your treatment, making up your treatment schedule, doing all of your monitoring and all of your procedures I cannot say enough good things about Dr T I was so scared about never being able to get pregnant again and Dr T made it happen for me on his first cycle T, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for being such a compassionate and caring doctor, for being such a smart and caring doctor, and most importantly, for being the miracle worker that you are!UPDATE #1: I now have a beautiful 4 month old baby thanks to Dr T! And I'll be going back to him next week to work towards baby #2!Update #2: thanks to DrT I am 6 months pregnant with baby#2 I am sorry for the other patients who suffered as a result of their poor management I suffered 2 miscarriages as a result of their negligent practices This Institue took a year of my life and all I received in return was an ""I'm sorry"" Dr Dicken was always responsive to emails within hours, even on the weekends When you create your treatment plan, you sit down with person who does billing And I know that the process to the end result can be stressful and painful I'm really surprised by the one-star reviews on here and had the complete opposite experience, so I wanted to express how highly I recommend Dr Dicken and the team at Sher  Fertility struggles are always difficult, and you may not get the results you hope for, but the team at Sher made the whole experience as pleasant as possible for me, and I successfully conceived my baby girl via IVF with Dr Dicken  I saw Dr Dicken at every appointment and she always took the time to answer my questions and discuss next steps  Five stars for the team at Sher- I'm already excited to get back in the office to meet with Dr Dicken and plan for my next baby! I like Dr Dicken and the patient coordinator, Jacqueline Dr Dicken is quite knowledgeable and has this girl next door appeal that completely puts one at ease Patient care receives four stars It was very obvious that the staff below the Dr level were not getting the support they needed I understand that Thanksgiving is a holiday, but in most cases the Dr is in charge of managing your cycle, so they could prevent this via closer management or better staffing And that's what Dr O'Shaughnessy doing (It took) Sher is a nightmare I said is there a balance on the accountI'm cuddling with my baby thanks to the efforts of the staff at Sher- especially Dr Wang and Raifa Zody, the embryologist Dr Wang is personable, explains everything fully, and even emails! I was never just a number  I saw a doctor at LIJ first, and would leave in tears after how he treated us Dr Wang was the complete opposite They made me feel comfortable and was very positive with the process I was about to start I saw Dr Tortoriello, He listened to me and gave me options that I could choose from based​ on my situation Dr T is an absolutely perfect, kind and humble person My baby is almost one year old Dr T was quick to reply my emails even on Sunday I hope that they replace her with someone nice Dr Dicken, a staff doctor, seemed nice, but was also clueless for a ""specialist"" Her suggested, cookie-cutter protocol wouldn't have worked for us Because of my uterus condition, I was told to give up getting pregnant by many doctors at NYU and CHR After two years of trying, my husband and I almost gave up to have a baby, but we wanted to try once more at Sher with Dr Tortoriello, and miracle happened!! AMAZING!! I got pregnant Different protocol and medications worked, and also, Dr Tortoriello was very kind and cared about his patients very much I am at 11 weeks of my pregnancy and still have long way to go, but I am very happy and appreciate Sher and Dr TortorielloAfter 5 long years trying to get pregnant  Dr Tortoriello was successful with me on a first try  I was told the truth by Dr T from the beginning  He gives the raw facts whether you want to hear it or not Dr O'Shaughnessy was thorough, patient and kind throughout the entire process I saw the same doctor at almost every visit (unless it was a weekend or she was on vacation) Dr O'Shaughnessy even came in on her weekend off to do my egg retrieval I now have a beautiful seven month old son, which I conceived by going to Cornell I went to NYU and Cornell and both doctors told me that they do not see any reason that the fibroids are causing infertility I am the same person with the same eggs and same husband and the same fibroids After I was devastated the second time it did not work, I emailed Dr Dicken, she responded with one line and repeated that I need to have surgery to remove my fibroids I then called to talk to her and she never called me back This is to say just to say how much he cared I am forever grateful to him Sher Institute gives me nightmaresI loved working with Dr Dicken She was patient, kind, and always available to answer all of my questions We went through a process of trial and error figuring out which treatment was best for me and ultimately I got pregnant My daughter was born a couple of weeks ago and I'm so grateful to have found Dr Dicken Fertility treatment can be stressful but I always felt like I was in good hands with Sher and I recommend them to anyone in a similar situationThe review below took the words out of my mouth  Every time I had to have surgery I cried on the table- not because I was scared, it was because everyone was so callous and cold  Dr Dicken will sit with you for however long you want to listen to your concerns and questions  She is caring, down to earth and smart They care, smile at you and know you by name!  I cannot put into words how amazing it feels to be at a place where everyone is genuinely nice and cares about youLastly, their surgery center is really niceIt is my honor to write this review on Dr Tortoriello (Dr T), who treated me with great knowledge and professional care We are joyful in my pregnancy the birth of our daughter this October and we are really glad to be treated by Dr T My husband and I were ready to give up after 3 years over thereAfter two months on the waiting list, we got our appointment with Dr T My first appointment with Dr Dicken went well, and I decided to continue my treatments with her I have never received a well formulated answer from her for the reasons of my multiple failures (I do get pregnant easily though, but always miscarry) My husband and I had a wonderful experience with everyone there and highly recommend this practiceDr O is a kind and warm person with an appropriate level of firmness and humor in her approach She explained things thoroughly and always assured that I was comfortable with each step It's taken me years to write this review because it was such a horrendous experience I was told later by multiple Doctors that the fertility Dr should never have taken my money because I could not hold a pregnancy with my fibroids In the end, I had my fibroids removed and got pregnant with New Hope FertilityLet me start off by saying I love my doctor, Dr Althea O'Shaughnessy she has been great through the process already and that is why I am giving a 4 star rating Because of the way my cycle fell I had to make an appt for Monday morning They couldn't confirm me when I called Friday but told me I would get a call Sunday  I don't know what the deal is because they have called me about other matters  I just don't care enough to do it  I did not feel like I was well taken care of  Appointments felt rushed, Dr Tortoriello who was my doctor didn't ask if I had any questions-ever-, and didn't really connect on a human level a whole lot  IVF is a tough process to go through, and I was hoping for a more pleasant, cared for, connected experience  Bushra, the nurse, who showed me how to use the injections buzzed through the instructions like she had to be elsewhere, I felt so rushed and felt like such a number not a human  I had to email the doctor and he said, no one talked to you after?  No  No one was there to see me out, to give me some instructions, I left feeling very confused and hoped that someone would contact me later She is warm and professional and her expertise helped us conceive our little miracle I highly recommend Sher and specifically under Dr O'Shaughnessy for any and all fertility needs  She has a great bedside manner and does not try to apply cookie cutter protocols I am grateful to have her help me through this journey and I would highly recommend her for IVF and fertility issuesDr Tortoriello does not really try to find a cause why you are infertile New Hope was a winner for me giving me my precious baby girl from the first try You need to chase down the phone line to get a simple straight answerDr Wang is very nice and that is the sole reason I decided to try there After 5 years of fertility treatments, my husband and I welcomed our daughter into the world on 2/7/18 Although it did take some time for us to find the protocols and treatments that ultimately worked (I have a fairly complicated medical history), I was continually amazed by the dedication Dr Dicken exhibited toward my case She was there at every turn -- from recommending different tests and treatment options along the way to returning panicked emails promptly to lending a compassionate ear when I needed it most Highly, highly recommendDr Dickens is an angel!!! I have been ttc for five years I'm now PREGNANT =-)  :) Dr Dicken was on maternity leave for the first IUI, so Dr T performed the 1st one and Dr Wang did my second IUI, both were great!!!! Dr Dicken is amazing, as are Dr T & Dr Wang! Dr Dicken sat with us for over an hour in the initial consultation and revamped my medication regiment to focus on egg quality rather than quantity  The doctors and nurses are all so warm & make you feel so comfortable I can't say I was a very complicated case, but even so, my husband and I were always treated as if we were the only patients there I never waited for more than 10-15 min to be seen by my dr And, when you have an appt (which you will have a lot of!) you will see YOUR dr I saw Dr T for each and every appt (except when I had to go in on one Sunday and he wasn't on call that weekend) I can't explain how comforting it is to know you are seeing the same dr during such an emotional processI only have positive things to say Not only is he intelligent, but also kind, extremely calm (which is something I needed!), and honest (he tells you how it is, so don't expect sugar coating) You will not feel like 'just another patient'  He actually cares and will thoroughly go over your history and make sure he treats you appropriately And, the best part - he was successful with us on our first IVF cycle! I can't recommend Sher and Dr T and his team enoughDr Wang is the BEST--he's gotten me successfully pregnant twiceAfter seeing other IVF specialists in the city and being told I would likely not have children with my own eggs, I decided to do some more research about who else could help me I was given Sher Institutes name from a friend and calling them was the best decision ever Not only did they help me get pregnant, but they made the difficult process so much easier  Dr Dicken was the most caring, empathetic and approachable doctor I've seen Dr Tortoriello understood our situation and decided to make it count Unlike our previous experience  in which we felt we were being treated like cattle, over at the Sher institute we felt like everyone there knew our situation and were there to help us make it happen  However, when I approached Dr T to explain this (a problem with signaling from my pituitary that only started when I was 20 yrs old), he had a plan in mind for my treatment and it worked! Throughout the process Dr T was so calm, positive and reassuring It took three rounds of treatment with IUI and I now have a beautiful healthy baby boy thanks to Dr T and his team! Dr Tortoriello is aces! The RE before him was recommending surrogacy or adoption When I went to see Dr Tortoriello I immediately felt that I could trust him He is one of the most balanced, caring and intelligent doctors I have ever had You really feel like he is plugged into your case You know that feeling, when you are sitting across from a doctor and he is giving you these canned answers, like he is reading from a script or has said this to so many people that he is bored of hearing it himself? Dr T is the exact opposite of that He is a real person When you get off the elevator the receptionists greet you by your first name (the opposite of making you feel like a number, which I felt so many times at other facilities) I have only ever heard them say good things about this facility and Dr T","My husband and I have been trying to have baby for many years We had amazing experience with Dr Dicken and staffs at Sher Institute They were very professional and because of them, we finally have our baby girl! I have a beautiful 2 year old son and am currently 6 months pregnant! I can't recommend them enough- and I do to anyone going through this process! I saw Dr Dicken at every appointment and she always took the time to answer my questions and discuss next steps . Dr Tortoriello was successful with me on a first try . I was told the truth by Dr T from the beginning . Every time I had to have surgery I cried on the table- not because I was scared, it was because everyone was so callous and cold .

43,Sher Institute For Reproductive Medicine,advice," The doctors also go on their own vacations for weeks at a time which can really interfere with your treatment Are you serious???!!! I didn't even ask for my scheduled time I just suggested I was there to see Dr Dicken I SWEAR I would think it was just me if I had not read the other reviews Well the damn specimen would've died by then I was out of hope and trust in SIRM and desperate for results After going through 6 cycles of IVF, yes you read that right 6 cycles, I only wish I switched to Cornell sooner and saved myself a lot of heartache and despair I hardly ever check YELP I wish you ladies all the best and pray for you all to be successful in your journeyplease reach out and pm me if you have any specific questions or want to talk Best wishes to allI am not sure if I trust this place as they have a ridiculous appointment policy  They took my $50 deposit for just making a call to schedule an appointment  First thing they asked when I called to schedule an appointment was my credit card information - $50 copay and $150 for cancelation fee  I can't really comment on the doctors here but don't think I can trust a place that's so money focused and only in it for profit  This is very dishearteningI was Dr Wang pt- him and his team were excellent It is such a pity to know he is no longer there I am not sure how a lump sum of 4k can get misplaced in the system with no record, but apparently at SHER it does Them comes to anesthesiologist which SHER hires for your procedures and it is SHER whom receives the payment I am traumatized by this practice They just care about the money  You are a number with a $ value no more I think they don't want you to be pregnant as they will make more money if you aren't We haven't been anywhere else and I wouldn't want to -- the level of professionalism, service, and friendliness is just right The only issue has been with the finance team -- they do not provide details invoices and very casually ask for a lot of money, without back-up documentation I can look overlook that, though, with the quality of care and service I've received He never pushes anything and always thinks outside of the box After meeting with me he did an immune workup and found that I have elevated NK activity He is always very receptive and caring The process was perfect and went so smoothly, we couldn't ask for a better outcome My spouse and I Love you from the bottom of our hearts for helping us create the family we once thought we would never have i went to the Westchester office which closed down while under treatment Since my doctor was fired and the office was closed about a week before my scheduled transfer,  I had to seek another doctor I find this  Institute to be unethical at its core My one piece of advice to potential patients is keep researching There has got to be better out there After our first attempt failed I went to Cornell, NYU and RMA for second opinions and also to find out how they proceed with  their protocols and maybe they would come up with new way of treatments for me Well, RMA had a very complicated payment options Very shady practice So I figured I will go back to Sher since I know how they operate You can basically choose what you want and/or need to do The most important thing, of course, is that I have my baby Fortunately my credit card company found the charges suspicious and contacted me right away And when I contacted the office manager Jessica about it she ignored my emails So be warned, if you can avoid it, pay by check instead25 stars if that were possible Also, for the record, I got pregnant at SHER, so I am not bitter I think it is awful to dismiss other reviews for this reason They admitted to me that the operator was less experienced and that they were understaffed because of Thanksgiving As a patient we go through an awful lot to get a viable egg I have since found out that not only is this not true but that if an egg is genetically determined to be a good egg, a woman in her 40s is almost as likely to get pregnant as a woman in her 20sI hate doctors do whatever tests or extra stuffs without asking the patients to make some extra money Like they think patients don't know anything I wasn't there for any pregnancy issues, and I made myself clear to the doctor why I am there After the short consultation with the doctor, they did the blood test So I obviously thought it was for my health issue I never asked for it or knew the blood test was for that For something I never asked for I am not only very mad about this rip-off situation, but also worried about the time that I will waste to make this thing correct Wish me good luckThe two stars are because I have a beautiful daughter that wouldn't have been possible without the help of IVF That said I know we would have had the same luck with any clinic Their scheduling system was a joke So I went in for the following visit and was asked to pay more money They didn't even care to check or notice Completely clueless They completely take advantage of the vulnerability in people who just want to be parents I've never had doctors fight so hard for me before It was amazing to be able to discuss questions and concerns with my actual doctor outside of appointmentsIf you look at Vitals or one of the websites that's known for rating doctors, rather than restaurants, you'll see that Sher has phenomenal reviews, which they've very much earned I am super excited, and I am recommending Sher Institute to anyone struggling to have a baby He is simply the best I do not need medical advice from front desk woman I was so disappointed that I tried timed intercourse and it worked SHER knew this and recommended a protocol, which I followed to a T Not only would it not have worked, but they aborted a procedure MID-TREATMENT (yes, during the procedure itself), because an independently contractor doctor was impatient, running late, and in a hurry This wasted my whole cycle Treatments were chosen based on their findings and now we have our son Thank you so much!!  I had done several yrs of acupuncture, herbs and nothing before I came to Sher  They also wanted 50,000 for their donor egg program  That was the only way i opened up tp other possibilitesI should have written this a long time ago I had fibroids and Sher doctors were insisting that I have to have a surgery I realize that medical opinions may vary among experts, but insisting so much that someone goes through surgery without backing up your claim is something else When I switched to Cornell, I realized that much higher standards exist The doctor even changed the dosage of the meds after each visit sometimes changing them a tiny bit here and there At Sher, they rarely changed the dosage and they were less meticulous about timing, weekly tests, etc So 1/1 at Cornell and 0/3 at Sher I advise you to stay away I wasted more that a year at Sher with no results and I am so sorry about it Mostly because my dad died and I would have wanted him to meet my son I am also really unhappy with their manners At Cornell, my doctor called me on a Sunday afternoon before my transfer (while walking his own kid to a birthday party)  No one listened to me, looked me in the eyes or cared  I was 1 of a million other patients  I was passed around between 7 or so doctors  Sher and Dr Dicken and her staff are *complete* opposites  She does not sugarcoat anything and is straight with you  She is just a really good person  Plus, one of the best parts is that you can email her your questions and she replies promptly)If you are starting your fertility journey, please start with Sher The meeting with the primary doctor was usually very cold and brief and I could feel that she was exhausted and was ready to dismiss me as fast as possible But we finally made up minds to search for another doctor and take the last IVF chance And all those online reviews are telling the consistent story He is the person I can trust He is not a magic maker but he is the best possible doctor you could work with as a man He won't give up if you don't but he also gives you alterative options and make sure that you are comfortable with your choices I believe his biggest goal is to make women fulfill their dreams of becoming a mother And with that goal, he stands out from his peers I had to be very proactive and be involved in every single step and know every single detail to make sure that I am being treated properlyI wish I had found Sher first Every piece of advice from the Sher team was perfect, especially their urologist recommendation, Dr David Kaufman Thanks to Dr O and the whole team at Sher we are expecting our first child, and I truly believe that this would not have happened if we stayed at the other clinicRun don't walk away from this place Even trying to get my medical records was gigantic ordeal Please don't waste your time and money with SHER Never happened and it slipped my mind to follow up Thank goodness I did, my appt was for 8:30 am No one ever came back and I had to climb down Also make sure you get a copy of EVERYTHING you sign Would give no stars but that is not an option But I DO have two pieces of advice1 - Ask questions  Ask more questions  Sher likes to email forms instead of handing them to you in the office  When you see these forms in your email, you might have questions, or the forms might be incomplete  Go ahead and email your questions back  There is a lot of paperwork  Let me say that again  I have never, not once, ever received a call telling me my appointment time  I learned to call between 4 and 5pm to confirm my appointment time  Seriously, if you havent heard anything from Sher about your upcoming appointment time by 4:45 - pick up your phone AND CALL!My partner and I had a really substandard experience with this officeWe have nothing bad to say about the doctor, only everything and everyone around herAs you may imagine we were unsuccessful in our attempts to get pregnant We wish you better luckI just want to say, I am not the kind of person who writes negative reviews  But this is worth writing  There was no followup from the doctor, not one word  I am exceptionally disappointed that I chose SHER and I will let everyone I know about my experienceDr O is simply the best She made a very stressful process with high emotions something that was optimistic and manageable She thinks outside the box and will go the extra mile I was not impressed as I was looking for much thorough doctors since we were young and healthy couple trying to conceive after already unsuccessful IVF I went to Cornell thinking they are the best, but we were again not blessed with the baby Imagine you have daily appointments at the end of the cycle And BTW, it is not surprising that they don't call you back as promisedI truly cannot thank Dr Dicken and the staff of SIRM enough for their hard work and support I literally just cleared my tubes two weeks ago and I found out I was pregnant today!!!! She is an awesome person! I'm soooooo glad I sought her help! She's not just about money, she REALLY CARED!!! She's the best Dr I've EVER had With her advice) Therefore, stay away from storing specimens at Gramercy IVF We HIGHLY recommend Sher above all else!!! Thank you SHER!!!!!!!Sher Fertility and Dr T are the absolute best There are so many options but please trust me and make an appt with Dr Texactly what you are looking for in a Doctor You will be in good hands! I wish I had known of them sooner!My condition was highly unusual, they don't have a name form to as it is very rare I had the sinking sense that he was just trying to get rid of me because I had a complicated fertility profile and he didn't want to mess up his excellent success rates Over the last six years I have met a lot of women struggling with IF Some women gush about him I am eternally grateful to him not just for getting me pregnant but for creating an atmosphere in which I could relax and trust which I believe helped me be successful","The doctors also go on their own vacations for weeks at a time which can really interfere with your treatment Are you serious???!!!

44,Sher Institute For Reproductive Medicine,nurse," She's very responsive on email and answers all of my questions, big and small, quickly and thoroughly Jackie and the nursing team have been fantastic, even responding to a panicked email late at night when I was having trouble with a trigger shot  I always had personalized attention at Sher from Dr Dicken and nurses Marian and Jackie and they always responded to me timely It was as if I sent her nothing - absolutely no response The problem here is that the nurse practitioners are made to double up as administrative co-ordinators, a nurse should support the medical process and a co-ordinator should guide you through the process Rest of the staff was wonderful specially the nurse Jackie P She answered emails quickly (and I sent lots) My experience here was fantastic I emailed her back with a couple questions and she never replied back Unclear and erroneous information (often errors in medication and instructions, no clarity about billing; 23 page invoice and unable/unwilling to answer questions about it) He is also very responsive via email (replied within couple of hours), which was super helpful for a nervous wreck like me He answers emails","She's very responsive on email and answers all of my questions, big and small, quickly and thoroughly Jackie and the nursing team have been fantastic, even responding to a panicked email late at night when I was having trouble with a trigger shot ."
45,Sher Institute For Reproductive Medicine,clinic,"I had a very disturbing experience with one of their doctor and nurse teams I would not recommend this place to anyone Their contact is rude, and short fused and hasn't called me back for months- until today!If you are looking for a fertility clinic please look no further- they made this process as beautiful as can beJust keep every record of payment and take a deep breath before you call their billing department in Las VegasHorrible experience Also I received a test that was out of network without being told and was billed $4,412! They have one method of doing IVF and even though I requested a new method I was never given one Do yourself a favor and go to a clinic that has better lab quality and will work harder for youI should have written this review a while ago when I had my first experience with the rude receptionist (I think she practices being her rudest everyday), and ridiculous scheduling system Regarding the consistently rude receptionist, the one with the glasses who sits on the side closest to the elevator - she never smiles, is unkind, demonstrates a consistent inability to help or accommodate and is consistently MATTER-of-FACT You would think the front desk staff would be a the softest, kindest spot in the clinic Regarding scheduling, I've had several scheduling incidents where they call me at the end of the day to provide an appointment time for the next day despite the preferred times offered I get to the front desk, the rude receptionist goes on to tell me with the snide look on her face that she doesn't have me on the schedule for 8, she has me on there for 8:30 The simple response would have been okay, but instead she had to let me know that I'm the schedule for 8:30 I can't understand how a fertility clinic can be so inefficientThe last straw is this specimen that I was told I could bring in at 8am and this same rude, unsympathetic reception insists that no one is available until after 8:30 Right now I FUCKING HATE THIS PLACE, as I sit in the reception area crying with a specimen that I'm certain may no longer be viableTrying to conceive when having challenges is already stressful and depressing and the additional challenges I experience with front desk staff and scheduling just makes this entire experience overwhelmingly sad When I asked why I wasn't informed that the biopsy was no longer usable I received the reply ""people don't usually wait that long"" To be specific, I waited 3 years to do the PGD because I thankfully had a successful cycle at Cornell For any of the reviews that say Cornell is like a factory, so many women go there because the care is world class Yet despite the high patient volume, I still felt more professionalism, kindness, and 'general ease' as a patient, then I ever felt at SIRM And for all the ladies that reached out to me with similar traumatic experiences at SIRM, I'm sorry I didn't respond to you in a timely manner  I called a few hours later to cancel my appointment and was told that they will be charging me $50 But this review is only about SHER: the billing was a disaster- when you are going through infertility, everything feels harder so you expect at least the fertility center makes it easier for youDespite of all these, we had to confirm and reconfirm the payments over and over: every couple of weeks would get an email saying "" you can not start your treatment unless you pay your balance""! Hence making calls and someone didn't know about the payment and then again and again! I think in a course if two months we confirmed the payments three times Now just waiting for my ultrasound He listens and most importantly this is like a boutique clinic where it is all about you  The office itself is so mismanaged Mistakes on med calendars, overlooking pertinent details, last minute delays in protocol were all common practice in my experienceIt's hard to give reviews to a place like that Meanwhile, the girl who seem to be like 18 years old in the billing department couldn't tell me what the percentage was or how much money I would get back They are very good at keeping track with your protocol and followups With That said, I didn't have to be on top of things all the time, because I was pretty sure that they do it for me None of the other places I've been to have such system This was very helpful for us They also made it very easy with prescriptions, I was looking for the cheapest places to find my drugs, and they would forward and re forward prescriptions for me to different pharmacies pretty quickly The nurses are also pretty cool, I've never had anyone being rude or unprofessional But honestly, I pretty much had a stress free experienceI've been waiting to write my review until after I delivered my beautiful healthy baby girl, which I did a couple of weeks ago  Sher differentiates itself because you really do get personal treatment and you do not feel like just a number, as tends to happen with the other large IVF clinics  Appointments were easy to schedule in the morning before work, and the team of receptionists and nurses all knew me personally and made everything super easy   This was a huge contrast to the other IVF clinics in NYC, where the receptionists were disorganized and didn't answer the phone half the time I would call  I think your experience with any of these clinics likely depends on how you like to work with your medical team- I'm always needing to be in control and need someone who will answer my calls and emails on time, and that's what I got at Sher that I didn't get elsewhere My experience was excellent and successful, and my beautiful healthy baby girl is a testament to thatThe staff are great Be wary of billing and never provide your credit card information lest you desire to pay for things that you did not authorize I authorized a payment of $2,000, and a couple of days later there were a few charges to restaurants and Pro Flowers The only place I used this card was at SIRMI have thought long and hard about writing this review, but I feel like other people who are about to start the ivf journey should absolutely be aware of the issues I experienced The first, but perhaps not the biggest, problem is that clinic is extremely disorganized When you find out that they have ordered the wrong medication (occasionally at great expense) on the day that you are supposed to be starting treatment, the stress that is added to the entire experience is exponential, because then it is up to you to run around town to find a specialty pharmacy that has the meds in stock, some of which are further constrained by national shortages Having now experienced a clinic where the co-ordinators support the nurses, it is a far more effective system and creates a much more supportive culture Every time something went wrong, which was pretty much weekly, no one took responsibility, never mind that no one apologized and the next time I went in everyone looked more and more terrified and harried, but because taking responsibility was for some reason impossible, it meant that no one would offer to help fix the problem This was because they were were understaffed and using a less experienced sonogram operator We started with 11 and ended up with 3, so losing 1 through carelessness is pretty epic Perhaps because if we had determined that more eggs were not viable they would not have been able to charge us for as many transfers and they would have made less money?My advice is to find a clinic that has not been bought as a commercial enterprise and is not run as a business I booked this place because I had some emergency issue about my health and it was the only place was available near my work Because this institute system is really slow and not organized The receptionists are rude and never pick up the phone The staff is rude and unhelpful The thing that gets me most upset is the lack organization with their billing What kinda response is that?! Then I was told the overcharge would be kept on file for future chargesThen I received a check in the mail with an arbitrary amount as a ""refund"" for being overcharged The numbers didn't even match No notification that things were changing just a bill saying we owe them more money for something we set up a monthly autopay forEvery staff I met at Sher from the first visit was very welcoming, friendly and made me feel comfortable TI worked for me Lady on the front desk is rudeRUN like your pants are on fire!!! Stunningly unprofessional After several failed attempts at another clinic, I found out I had immune issues Then, they sent me outrageous bills for he procedure that never happened! You can't make this stuff up When I moved to another clinic, they were willing and able to work with an immunology clinic in CA, where I shipped my blood regularly  I feel he was competent and I never had to worryHe knows what he's doing I would never go to another doctorI came to Sher after a frustrating experience at another ""monster"" clinic, the kind that makes you feel like a number and not a patient My first experience at Sher was completely different She is a compassionate provider and up on the latest techniquesThe staff at Sher is informative and supportive Jessica, the office manager, took a good hour to go through the financial options The front desk staff were responsive and the nursing staff were consistently kind and personable If you are looking for a fertility clinic I strongly recommend you interview them They were pretty sloppy The staff at Sher always made me feel at home which is helpful when it feels like you live there! They always had appointments first thing in the morning and I was often in and out within 15 minutesI was also at another clinic before this one  They treated me and all the other patients as farm animals The nurses are also exceptional  Not only is the staff remarkable, but from an operational aspect, Sher also kick-a** I have never had a scheduling issue and the staff in charge of insurance matters is extremely informative, competent and easy to work with  You have an individual room to recover!  (At my other clinic you recovered right next to the other women who had surgery, with the only divider being a sheet  This is an emotionally taxing enough endeavor- do yourself a favor and start with a clinic that cares about you We had really hard time attending the other factory-like clinic--dealing with multiple doctors, waiting in long lines and facing with a big stack of bills He is compassionate and objective at the same timeI came to SIRM after a frustrating experience at another clinic I was very happy to find out that she communicates via email which is something that in this day and age all doctors should be doing I had previously been to another clinic where I felt like part of a herd being shuffled in and out with no personalized careSher was the total opposite, from Yochana at the front desk to the office manager Jessica; but most importantly Dr O'Shaughnessy and her team All of the nurses and clinical staff were great too, especially Voula who went absolutely above and beyond when we ran into a hiccup in our cycle I would give it negative stars if I could  The doctor and nurses gave me such bad and insufficient information and wouldn't take any responsibility for it  They are the worst HOWEVER, I have to agree with the other reviewers about the office staff and the rudeness and lack of follow up So I arrived for 8 am just in case I had an early appt like requested When I called to make my next appointment, the receptionist asked me when I would like to come in I said first available please, ""Ma'am what time do you want to come in?"" The tone was so rude, I replied ""8 am or 8:30?"" Again she didn't give me a time just told me they would call and confirm the time If you can't give me a time and you know your first available appointment is at 8 am why ask me for a specific time?!??! Like I said I keep going back for my doctor and my nurse, Annie Chan, but the rest of the staff be warnedBy far the worst experience I have had with a doctor's office The Manhattan location is the rudest by far After a procedure I was told they would be back in 10 minutes to help me down from the table Be mindful of billing I had fraudulent charges for check fees on dates where checks were never sent The Westchester location had a staff member attempt to put my signature on an insurance form When I showed up at the Manhattan location they tried to get me to resign the form that had the fraudulent signature I will never go back to this office againI don't have anything bad to say about this place People in the office have been really helpful  Its okay to do this2 - No matter what they tell you, never wait for them to call you with an appointment time  For those who don't know, SHER doesnt have 'cattle calls' like many other clinics do  Instead, they assign appointment times the afternoon before the day you're supposed to go in to the office  In therory they will call you by 5pm and tell you what time to be in the office the next day  I even totally missed an appointment this way because I waited, and no one called Miscommunication with the lab caused a months' delay and the office staff was untruthful about this until pressed Scheduling with wrong doctors, wrong medications indicated on treatment schedule, incorrect information on dosing caused lost time at work to find alternative sourcesWe are not medical experts, but the constant stream  of small errors gave us little confidence in the process or the personnel  This was absolutely a horrible way to treat a patient who paid good money for this procedure and now who is walking out the door having had the transfer only to feel like they were 'done' with me  The nurse who called me to give me the bad news said he would follow up, and probably take another blood test etc  but they have ostensibly dropped all further 'care' now that they have my money The doctor's office is run like a well-oiled machine, but with good bedside manner Office hours are the most flexible I've ever seen, I never had to wait more than a minute upon arrival to be seen, often I'd even arrive early and would be out before my scheduled appointment time The office staff were also incredibly helpful and caringDrDicken is my favorite doctor at SIRM NYCThis facility is not closed, however, I had the WORST experience with it just like the first reviewer I recommend you to run away from this place Some of the staff are really rude Among the worst is its office manager ironically   Make sure you read the financial plans line by line You need to book each monitoring appointments with the front desk even though the monitoring is routine and preset  After you make the appointment, you need to wait for the front desk to call you for appointment confirmation until the day before However, I didn't expect to have to deal with so many incompetent staff which could jeopardize the result of an entire cycle Before working with the team at Sher we had been to two other clinics in 3 years and had subpar experiences at both The nurses and office staff here are also top notch She insisted I have another done this time with canalization Even though it was a short period of time The doctors answer your emails even on the weekends and in the evenings!!  The front staff are great too We had such a bad experience at RMA All the receptionists and nurses came to know us by name and were genuinely always happy to help Also, the new offices are beautiful! If you are unsure of which clinic in NYC to choose, this next part is for you Sher is not a factory like the other clinics (ie Cornell, RMA) I was actually nervous while in the waiting room before my first appt because there weren't hundreds of women waiting But I've later realized it's because they actually go by appts and honor the appts; you will not be 1 of 10 patients scheduled at 2pm Not just a nurse or whoever is there that day You will have his attention for as long as you need; he never rushed me out She empowered me to help make decisions while providing excellent guidance and expertise She provided so much calmness to me and I couldn't have done it without herWe came to the Sher institute after failed attempts at Cornell and Columbia clinics We couldn't be happier with Dr T and his staff, and can't wait to see our little baby boy in a few more months Throughout the procedure all the staff was very helpful and responsive to our schedule and concerns and we can't be more grateful for their great service Definitely, the best fertility clinic out there Just wish we had gone there in the first place He took my preferences into account and was always flexible with appointments regarding my work schedule After six years of dealing with, seemingly intractable, infertility and going to five of the most reputable clinics on both the east coast and west coasts, I am now 12 weeks pregnant He doesn't make huge promises (read: sales pitches) but he is more focused on his patients and designing custom protocols for them than any of the other seven doctors I have seen at those five top facilities The previous poster is in California so perhaps she is confusing this facility with another one This is the most responsive and caring group of medical professionals I have EVER experiencedThis office is not closed but is absolutely TERRIBLE in their communication Medically they are OK but they are rude, unhelpful, and treat you like just another #","I had a very disturbing experience with one of their doctor and nurse teams I would not recommend this place to anyone Their contact is rude, and short fused and hasn't called me back for months- until today!If you are looking for a fertility clinic please look no further- they made this process as beautiful as can beJust keep every record of payment and take a deep breath before you call their billing department in Las VegasHorrible experience Also I received a test that was out of network without being told and was billed $4,412! Hence making calls and someone didn't know about the payment and then again and again! I think in a course if two months we confirmed the payments three times Now just waiting for my ultrasound He listens and most importantly this is like a boutique clinic where it is all about you . Sher differentiates itself because you really do get personal treatment and you do not feel like just a number, as tends to happen with the other large IVF clinics . This was a huge contrast to the other IVF clinics in NYC, where the receptionists were disorganized and didn't answer the phone half the time I would call . You can't make this stuff up When I moved to another clinic, they were willing and able to work with an immunology clinic in CA, where I shipped my blood regularly . Not only is the staff remarkable, but from an operational aspect, Sher also kick-a** I have never had a scheduling issue and the staff in charge of insurance matters is extremely informative, competent and easy to work with . You have an individual room to recover! . ( Its okay to do this2 - No matter what they tell you, never wait for them to call you with an appointment time . For those who don't know, SHER doesnt have 'cattle calls' like many other clinics do . In therory they will call you by 5pm and tell you what time to be in the office the next day . of small errors gave us little confidence in the process or the personnel . This was absolutely a horrible way to treat a patient who paid good money for this procedure and now who is walking out the door having had the transfer only to feel like they were 'done' with me . Make sure you read the financial plans line by line You need to book each monitoring appointments with the front desk even though the monitoring is routine and preset ."
46,Sher Institute For Reproductive Medicine,protocol," After multiple IUI's and miscarriage, we decided to do IVF After 4 rounds of IUI and 2 IVF with no results I did one IUI with gen next and GOT PREGNANT! There labs are old and can cause many issues within the processI hardly ever YELP but I am doing an update to say that I tried to send out the biopsy of my only surviving embryo at SIRM for PGD after three years of it being frozen and was told by Carey Dicken and the office manager that I no longer had the option to do PGD because the biopsy is now too old Why didn't I use my embryo in the first place you might wonder? Because I was down to the last of my savings and it would've cost almost as much to transfer that embryo at SIRM as it would to do a full donor cycle at Cornell I had 36 eggs retrieved I noticed that 3 days after!!!!! Can you believe that, they gave me expired medication!- I got one of the eggs they retrieved transfered by RMA I was pregnant for 10 weeks I am sure they took the money and didn't test the embryo  Thank to them i am 10 weeks pregnant and I am just waiting to have this fetus dies into my body as it had genetic default!!!!! Can you imagine the trauma - They obviously failed at an other transfer I did with them We did IVF with PGS and on my first attempt I got a BFP You are not another patient in a factor setting like you would be at the big academic institutions (where I got my BFN with a PGS normal embryo) And the best part is that for the transfer he allowed my husband to come into the room with me! He was able to see the transfer and the embryo go into my uterus liveStay far far away I was told by my doctor that I had 2 frozen embryos for my next transfer Which at the day of my transfer we discovered I did not have 2 embryos but a morula and and early stage blast  Both which are unlikely to result in pregnancy  I wonder if I would have stayed with sher if they would have continued to lie to me about the quality of my embryos I had a professional doctor review my embryo results and NONE were considered to be viable for transfer They transferred 2 fresh and froze another 2  In other words, the don't comply with industry standards on viable embryos I've never had an issue with them forgetting to call me and inform me about any changes to my protocol And I have additional frozen embryos from my IVF cycles, which I'll transfer in hopes of bringing my daughter a sibling Another huge problem with this clinic is that for the first embryo transfer they took far too long to transfer the embryo into my body The embryo should not be outside of storage or the body for more than a few seconds, 30 seconds is a long time for this process, and for my first transfer it took a few minutes The final issue I will share with you is that they told me that the genetic sequencing of the embryo is a waste of money The older you get the less good eggs you have I don't know why they missled us? IVF is split into 2 halves, egg retrieval (out of you to be fertilized) and then the fertilized egg is transferred back into you The egg retrieval is reasonably easy, 2 weeks of tiny under the skin injections, but the transfer is far more intense with months of bigger injections into the muscle However, next time I realized they did a genetic test through other company, about if my babies are going to have any genetic issues I was overstimulated and there for had fluid in my uterus (Caused by them) and then was told instead of doing a fresh transfer I should wait a few cycles and do a frozen transfer (which would be another $5000 and the money shouldn't be my deciding factor) I said I believed in my body and why wouldn't we try the transfer because there was a possibility it would work Then was told well actually I'm going to be out of town on your transfer day so was it my body or their convenience I did the fresh transfer with another dr and the fluid was no longer present  They are crooks With his great work, I had a successful IVF procedure I did two IUIs and one timed intercourse with injectable cycle I agree with the negative review on this page She messed up with my IUI timing Then gave me lecture that how my egg will wait for 24 hours after ovulation so they can slide my appointment of IUI Everyone knows that IUI is time critical She also told me that ivf patients are priority for egg retrieval and my egg can waitDrTortoriello made me pregnant!! I had developed Asherman syndrome after I lost my identical twin girls at 17 weeks of my pregnancy, and I had three uterus surgeries to remove my scar tissue I also tried north shore in manhasset and after a surgery, 4 iuis and a failed ivf nothing My first round of IVF ended in a chemical pregnancy after which the doctor came up with a new strategy that made all the difference I did two rounds of unsuccessful IVF (two rounds of retrieval and two rounds of transfers) I had enough eggs and that was not a problem I even scheduled my surgery to remove fibroids but decided to get other opinions I got pregnant with the first attempt at Cornel and with transferring only ONE embryo At Sher, the first round they transferred  one embryo and the second round two embryos He said that he proposes we only transfer one embryo (we had talked about transferring two) and that there are risks associated with carrying twins at my age, etcOh yeah, and it worked We brought home our son the other day and he's healthy and perfect I went to Dr T when I was 38 after many rounds of IUI and two IVF with another clinic My case was not easy for her, and she tried her best to adjust my protocol but that is all she could do I would need to have them removed before in-vitro  Coming to SHER for my IVF was a mistake  After my transfer, I was given NO instructions  Unfortunately, I had a chemical pregnancy and was not able to keep the pregnancy I recently had a hysteroscopy performed by DrDicken and my uterus looks so much better after she removed all of the scar tissue He suggests right away the IVF and assumes various scenarios without any analysis I finally consulted with Dr Dicken and went thru 2 egg retrievals and several transfers at SIRM I had an HSG done and the result was both tubes were blockedSher is the best!!! At the age of 36 and after trying for over a year and a half and after 2 IVFs, 1 FET transfer, & 4 IUIs, we finally discovered Dr Dicken and this clinic On the second IUI, we got a POSITIVE pregnancy result for the first time ever!!!!! I am only 4 weeks pregnant, but all seems to be going well Dr Azim was great BUT the lab that he uses (Gramercy IVF) has freezers that ruined our sperm quality which was excellent quality from a sperm bank This is actually the reason why we ended up having subpar thawed sperm for our first IUI at SHER (b/c it had been stored at Gramercy IVF before being transferred to Sher  I would recommend this group to anyone who has been told what I was, or if you are just starting off on your IVF journey He didn't want to just pump large quantities of drugs and getting a large amount of eggs, but he cared more about getting quality eggs He decided to use a different mixture of drugs that helped us produce quality eggs and he made it count as promised He was resisting doing an embryo transfer even though we had frozen embryos His exact words 'You deserve at least one transfer if not more before going to surrogacy' I got pregnant on my first FET with him He remembers your info when you have an appt with him","After multiple IUI's and miscarriage, we decided to do IVF After 4 rounds of IUI and 2 IVF with no results I did one IUI with gen next and GOT PREGNANT!

47,Sher Institute For Reproductive Medicine,cost," Month after month I was billed incorrectly They charge a ridiculous fee just for consultation First they quoted us the wrong amount, we paid everything then in a couple of weeks they corrected their mistakes and we paid the balance  Well, turned out our anesthesia was one of the few things that could be covered by our insurance and the anesthesiologist was indeed in network We never got the hold of the anesthesiologist and never got 400$ back nor SHER helped us through it I had to take medication during one week after the retrieval ( additional cost 1500$) to decrease the blooding, only 19 fertilizedI went to an other practice (RMA NY ) 30 eggs, 29 fertilized, no medication after the retrieval, no blooding, shorter cycle! - I was running out of medication, they was nice enough to help me until i received by meds with EXPIRED MEDICATION Then we discovered the embryo has some genetic default which should have been discovered during the genetic testing they have done (very expensive)- They charge you for everything They will misrepresent them so you will continue with the pricey treatments Dr Dicken got the job done on our second IVF, both times we paid out-of-pocket for everything You Basically had to pay for everything in front and then if you didn't have any fertilized eggs for example they would somehow refund you a percentage for what would have been a transfer At cornell, although I brought in all of my medical records, they made me do an ultrasound and pay for out-of-pocket $900 After all this is why I'm paying them She has detailed description of procedures and their prices printed out for you You also have a clear understanding how much you're paying and for what Couple of times I ran out of medications and they would actually give me meds to cover me until I got my meds shipped  My husband and I met with Dr Dicken multiple times to strategize the best IVF plan for us given our medical issues, the cost our health insurance would cover, and what we could afford Plus, I wasn't there for pregnancy!!

Ana and Thalia were thorough and would always remember my allergy Dr Toledo was kind to schedule a call with me so that I could ask her questions about embryology Demet always greeted me with a hug even though all my 2019 appointments were with Expect and not Extend They had the most patience with me I had SO many questions She truly cared She provided me with so much emotional support This journey was long and hard and it was sometimes difficult to think that I would ever reach my end goal Thank you so much to everyone at Extend and Expect Fertility!I wish someone had shared their experiences with Extend, so I could have skipped the 2 cycles with them, and saved my ovaries  Don't get fooled by their promotions and sales pitch Very rude and impatient )But the methods they use are so aggressive and ineffective   They try to pump as much medication into you as possible, hoping to get the best results  But it turned out to be very counterproductive and I am afraid its harmful to my body in the long run  They just rigidly go by the 36 hours rule  But the doctor can't tell me why  I even got yelled by doctor G for asking about the reason )I only found out how these things are wrong after I went to New Hope for my third cycle this month  I didn't have to use manupor  And the result was better New hope is not the best   just for the full disclosure But if I could have done it again, I wouldn't have gone to the extend at all  I feel really regretted, not for the money,  but worried about how all the cycles might have impacted my health  But it's my fault that I didn't do a thorough research first  So I just want to share the experience hereI have had an incredible experience with Extend Fertility The procedure itself was a breeze  According to the internet, I was basically barren and destined to live my life childless and in pain  I think freezing my eggs allowed me to relax and not worry so much of my impending infertility  And I went through the extra steps to go through the screening so if my two best friends need eggs, they are there for them too  I'm happy I froze my eggs and it was well worth the investment, even though I happened to conceive naturally (they say this is NOT uncommon) A few articles/videos were done about my experience  Feel free to check them out!fortune I came to Extend after consultations with a fertility specialist that demanded a psych visit before I could start, and would have charged three times what Extend charges Extend trusts that you have made the right decision for yourself, and even works with your health insurance for you! I cannot say enough good thingsExtend Fertility truly does give women access to latest reproductive technology at about half the cost This, in my opinion, is an extraordinary accomplishment I wish I was better prepared for this - my ""Fertility Specialist"" (initial sale / coordinator) downplayed the fact that it might be ""normal"" for me to throw up multiple times per day during the treatment Despite the temporary side effects and communication issues, the outcome is well worth itI can't say enough good things about Extend Fertility So I tabled my decision for a few months Then I was served an Instagram ad for EF, and figured it was worth a look The whole setup caters to women looking to freeze their eggs, as opposed to most places which have traditionally only focused on infertilityI had the best experience from start to finish working with Extend Fertility I conducted a lot of research prior to choosing Extend, and Extend exceeds all expectations in regards to what one should be looking for when searching for the right fertility clinic This practice fully understands the process and walks you through each step in the exact way they should, without foregoing quality (don't go to a ""trendy"" clicic that offers champagne, hashtags and no actual endocrinologists--OBYN's are not specialized enough) I will recommend Extend to any woman I know who is interested in freezingI completed 2 cycles w/ Extend Fertility I went to several clinics before deciding where to freeze and am happy I chose Extend for a few reasons: (1) I really appreciated that I could go in for a consultation at Extend without paying anythingChoosing Extended Fertility was one of the best decisions of my life Others required more commitment upfront, were more expensive overall, and specialized more in INfertility issues than someone who wanted to simply preserve her fertility If I had to do it all over again: I would choose Extend hands down","Don't get fooled by their promotions and sales pitch Very rude and impatient )But the methods they use are so aggressive and ineffective . They try to pump as much medication into you as possible, hoping to get the best results . But it turned out to be very counterproductive and I am afraid its harmful to my body in the long run . They just rigidly go by the 36 hours rule . I even got yelled by doctor G for asking about the reason )I only found out how these things are wrong after I went to New Hope for my third cycle this month . And the result was better New hope is not the best . just for the full disclosure But if I could have done it again, I wouldn't have gone to the extend at all . I feel really regretted, not for the money, . but worried about how all the cycles might have impacted my health . But it's my fault that I didn't do a thorough research first . So I just want to share the experience hereI have had an incredible experience with Extend Fertility The procedure itself was a breeze . According to the internet, I was basically barren and destined to live my life childless and in pain . I think freezing my eggs allowed me to relax and not worry so much of my impending infertility . And I went through the extra steps to go through the screening so if my two best friends need eggs, they are there for them too . I'm happy I froze my eggs and it was well worth the investment, even though I happened to conceive naturally (they say this is NOT uncommon) A few articles/videos were done about my experience .

It's been such a long journey for me Maha was always kind to confirm with me when she received my deliveries Jordana was super organized and made sure I understood what was going on and what each procedure entailed To the nurses: Molly, Stephanie and Valerie She said that she would call me in 30 minutes to check on my symptoms- and she called in exactly 30 min She followed up a couple of more times afterwards  As attentive as they can be at the beginning, what really matters to us in the end is their method and the result it delivers  The clinic is pretty well organized  They are very rigid with statics, and treat every patient like how a textbook would instruct  I was pretty skeptical about them at the beginning, and even wanted to go back to the extend The extend sells them well for all the charts and statistic based result oredicatjoBut at New Hope, they customize the medication for youI froze my eggs in August of 2016 and was very happy with my experience  The narrative around PCOS for a single woman in her mid-30s was that infertility was highly possible and interventions to conceive were likely  I was single, and pretty ambivalent about having children, and found that I was pretty stressed about the prospect of having to worry about this as I potentially started a new relationship (after all, I didn't intend to be single my entire life!)  I am from Austin, TX and did some shopping around in my local area, but didn't find any facility as well-oiled and competent as Extend Fertility (and the price was better than what I was finding around here)  I was able to retrieve 30 eggs, 20 of which were viable/mature enough to freeze and the retrieval process was pretty painless (I couldn't laugh or cough without a little pain for the next couple of days) and flew back to Austin, TX with no issues a couple days after the procedure  Conceiving natural was seeming pretty much 100% out of reach and whatever you do- don't go on the internet when stuff like that gets told to youcom/business…nbcnewyorkIt's amazing how Extend manages to make this not-so-pleasant process such an empowering one The doctors are board certified, knowledgeable and experienced, and the nurses are professional All that said, Extend Fertility is a place that offers great price by cutting out everything that does not relate directly to the outcome of the process The nurses and doctors are always rushed and not easily accessible (only through the answering service) I feel that egg freezing is a smart choice for any woman over 30, and Extend Fertility prices make this choice much easier  I had met with one of the best doctors at NYU (and he was fantastic, nothing against him), but the overall experience at NYU felt very complicated I appreciated that the red tape/endless departments etc of a large hospital system was also taken out of the equation, and it was never a problem or hassle to get a question answered Everyone was so kind, professional, friendly, knowledgable and respectful and made the entire process extremely easy! Working with Extend to complete an egg freezing cycle was a very positive and productive experience for me All of the doctors, nurses and advisors were so transparent, kind, attentive and made the process as smooth and easy as it could have possibly been Everyone I worked with from the first consultation to the retrieval date, provided incredible service The facility is very clean and aesthetically pleasing as well, which also adds to the ease and comfort of the processThis is an incredible practice and facility From the moment I stepped foot into the clinic, Extend Fertility staff eased both of those experiences This is the place for such a procedure! Not only are they affordable, they're incredible peopleExtremely rude staff specifically a fertility specialist name Cara, although they are less expensive than RMA it isnt worth it with what you have to deal with , with the unprofessional ignorant staff there They went above and beyond, gave tips on how to minimize the cost of medicine, and FaceTime'd with me after hours when I needed a refresher on how to inject my medicineThere were so many things I loved about my experience at Extend Most other clinics were charging several hundred dollars just to go in for a consult(2) Extend only treats egg freezing patients, so in contrast to other fertility clinics where most of their patients are couples that are trying to get pregnant, when you are at Extend, everyone who is undergoing treatment is just like you I had researched several other clinics in other cities, and in NYC The first blood test AND the first preliminary appointment were totally free, requiring zero financial commitment until I made my decision I travel for a living, so my main concern was how to schedule my monthly cycle around my travel work schedule! The entire staff at Extend, from the receptionists to the nurses and doctors, understood my situation and adapted around it I was also nervous about the shots, so they let me come in for a second instructional session with one of the nurses I am a huge advocate for educating women about this option; having done this procedure at this incredible clinic makes it even easier to recommend","They made the process so easy I can't say enough great things about them!Overall very happy with the Extend Fertility process .

You are truly a number Do not, do not use them They will only do what's necessary so that you spend the most money with themand don't be fooled Do not do it to yourself and your spouseWe cannot begin to thank Dr Forman for the gift he brought to our lives Going to our first meeting was a big step From our first discussion, Dr Forman educated us on all of the risk factors that we faced and helped us weigh the best way to achieve parenthood Unlike the lucky couples that were successful the first try we had a few more stumbles Because of the commitment to us, on February 1, 2016 we welcomed our little miracle into this world, our precious daughter We wanted to thank the entire RMA staff, your team of doctors, and especially Dr Forman for making our dream come true However, I have read some reviews that seem very disturbing to me In terms of doctors, I dealt with a few of them and I clicked with some of them better than with others, especially Marcy Maguire, my doctor They do a great job for many They have a philosophy and they stick with it They are there to help us conceive And they certainly try to do a good job for all However, it is a difficult thing to tell some of us things we are sometimes not prepared to hear But this was not the general experience with RMA, these were isolated experiences Personally,  I have learned that us the patients, the doctors, and the nurses all deal with this process differently and you can not be all tuned in with each other at all times What matters is that they do a good job Can they improve I'm some aspects, of course I have a full time job, did not want another!   They say to stay positive when almost all interaction with them was negative  I should have immediately looked elsewhere when my first experience with RMA was them threatening to cancel my appointment if they didn't receive about 10 pages of personal information before the first appointment  They provide minimal information about what's happening, why you are doing such actions, and what you can expect in the future  When you ask questions they get frustrated and become very short with you  They are rude and will bully you by saying that if you deviate from their recommended procedures they will stop working with you  Then at the end of the conversations will say that they care and only want what's best for you  Even though I want to get pregnant, ironically I hope that I don't as I don't trust their competence and fear that any child created would have development issues because of what RMA didOur baby was born on 5/13/15 after working with Dr Shefali Shastri from RMANJ  We'll be going back for sure  We are still patients there but are seriously considering other clinics  I have started asking around, and have been told that it's more typical to be able to call a clinic and actually speak to someone as well as to have a way to communicate with your doctor (ex: by email) Working with them vs It only makes RMA look worse in my eyes and any recommendations I would ever give would be to go to IRMS at St Robin Odom is rude and condescending Never explain allocated money and forget trying to get a refund from themI conceived at RMA  I originally went to them because their reputation as ""the best"" and I was never disappointed You hardly ever see your actual doctor Don't warn you of procedure expectations There is NO COMMUNICATION! This is just one of many stories I am not bitter, I am pregnant but just don't want to see others go through what I did with RMA Why would you ever say that to a woman who tied her tubes ? Maybe they should actually prepare for the consult by reading the file ?!?! A factory in every sense of the word My suggestion is to seek out a practice that can provide a more individualized approach to medicine So you are getting the most advanced care you can get, probably anywhere Dr Scott, Dr Forman and the fellows publish the research If you search for Scott on Google Scholar you'll see on their latest publications (Personally, I didn't take the steroids or the antibiotics because I couldn't find sufficient evidence in the literature that they made a difference Had I known how well we would do, I think I would've gone to a lower-tech clinic and not done extended culture, ICSI, CCS, etc But that's with the clarity of hindsight All I'm saying here is that you should question them about every intervention They want to give you all this stuff because it MIGHT help","RMA's strong research guides treatment, saving you from having to research options such as embryo glue or assistive hatching . Ask RMA to draw on your body with a marker so you know exactly where to inject the PIO shotsPlease note that children are not allowed in RMA buildings It was January and my kids were 6 and 2 so this wasn't going to work well You might want to check with your insurance carrier ahead of time to avoid an unexpected expense . RMA has excellent success rates, and I didn't write this review to discourage you from choosing them Best of luck to you! . If you're not sure if you need IVF, if want to conceive naturally or with IUI, I don't know if RMA-NJ is what you need or not . I do know that almost all fertility advice is that if you're over 35 and have tried for 6 months and can't conceive, it's time for IVF . It's just that it's not worth wasting time (especially over 35) with other things because time is ticking and the best shot is IVF . So my concern was not finding a doctor that would help us conceive naturally - my only concern was finding the best IVF clinic I could afford . The people who say you never see your doctor are mostly right -- you might see your doctor once in a while, but in general, you don't . Every appointment I have a chance to ask a doc any questions I want to, and they have my entire record in front of them due to RMA's seemingly awesome technological record keeping and great organizational setup . No, they don't all exude warm fuzzies, but they do all exude professionalism and give me what I need . They know what they are doing One- this whole process and concept is difficult and emotional however, I personally didn't want someone being overly emotional or giving me false hope . I love that this place is crowded- have you seen their success rates, no wonder?! . I knew right after meeting with Dr Dougherty that I was in good hands and have trusted everything they have told me . I met with the nutritionist in the office and this was my only gripe- I didn't agree with some of what she was saying . The doctor and anesthesiologist attended to me right away, got me comfortable and got my eggs out . In short- if you want someone to hold your hand, . blow smoke up your ass and beat around the bush- just keep trying on your own . You have to trust that their treatment plan is individualized to you based on their recommendations . This is NOT a waste of money or time if you are realistic . You can't blame everyone who's trying to help . Good vibes to all the want to be moms and dads!Absolutely terrible they caused a nightmare situation that has caused me to be depressed and anxious stay away from this fertility factory if you don't want to end up in a psych ward Especially, My nurse, Lynette and My doctor Dr Shastri are two angels What happens in our life is destiny We can't blame a center But we expected a detailing of billing and more explanationWhat a waste of $30k . I did and I wish I knew this from the start . They tried to convince her that at 37 she was already too broken . They were completely uninterested in talking about other less invasive fertility treatments . If we had stayed with RMA, we would never have been blessed with our two little angels I would give them no stars if it was an optionI'll be having my baby any day now! Christine Helbo was my nurse and I spoke to her prob everyday and I think she got sick of me asking questions I've had problems staying pregnant and it turned out that I definitely needed to do IVF in order to have a healthy baby It stuck the first time! I have learned that us the patients, the doctors, and the nurses all deal with this process differently and you can not be all tuned in with each other at all times What matters is that they do a good job Can they improve I'm some aspects, of course I have a full time job, did not want another! . They say to stay positive when almost all interaction with them was negative . I should have immediately looked elsewhere when my first experience with RMA was them threatening to cancel my appointment if they didn't receive about 10 pages of personal information before the first appointment . They provide minimal information about what's happening, why you are doing such actions, and what you can expect in the future . When you ask questions they get frustrated and become very short with you . They are rude and will bully you by saying that if you deviate from their recommended procedures they will stop working with you . Then at the end of the conversations will say that they care and only want what's best for you . Even though I want to get pregnant, ironically I hope that I don't as I don't trust their competence and fear that any child created would have development issues because of what RMA didOur baby was born on 5/13/15 after working with Dr Shefali Shastri from RMANJ . We are still patients there but are seriously considering other clinics . I have started asking around, and have been told that it's more typical to be able to call a clinic and actually speak to someone as well as to have a way to communicate with your doctor (ex: by email) Working with them vs It only makes RMA look worse in my eyes and any recommendations I would ever give would be to go to IRMS at St Robin Odom is rude and condescending Never explain allocated money and forget trying to get a refund from themI conceived at RMA . I originally went to them because their reputation as the best and I was never disappointed You hardly ever see your actual doctor Don't warn you of procedure expectations There is NO COMMUNICATION!

59,Reproductive Medicine Associates of New Jersey RMANJ,clinic," My stim prescriptions were initially sent to Freedom Fertility, and I called and scheduled delivery Then I called to confirm a few days later RMA rescinded the prescription, and sent it to a different pharmacy I was not informed of this by RMA My Lupron prescription was sent to the first pharmacy, not the second  They promised to send the prescription first thing next day At 12 I called the pharmacy, and was told the prescription wasn't in but the deadline was 3:30 At 3 I called again, and was told I'd been given the wrong information and the prescription arrived too late since the deadline was 2:30, not 3:30 I insisted on speaking to a supervisor, who checked and saw that the deliveries hadn't been picked up yet  They filled my prescription immediately, so I got my drugs in time But you'll save yourself a lot of stress if you double-check your drugs immediately You can't return online meds, so please check prescriptions prior to ordering Some online pharmacies have pharmacists on call during certain hours  My stims took longer than usual, so my retrieval was scheduled while my mother was away We had to leave at 6:30 to arrive at 7:30 in Basking Ridge The earliest daycare started at 7, so we could easily be there at 8 My nurse stated that 8 is too late, and suggested we leave our kids in the car with my husband watching them during my retrieval and my watching them when he deposited his sample since the procedures didn't take place at the same time With the transfer, I realized we might be better off calling the Basking Ridge clinic directly to ask for the earliest time so we could pick our kids up from school (retrievals are done in the morning; transfers in the afternoon) They kindly moved our transfer up to the earliest possible time, so we didn't have to worry about our kids      RMA allows outside monitoring (my nurse told me it wasn't allowed but my doctor said it's fine) It might be difficult to find somewhere that can perform both an ultrasound and bloodwork, but a few appointments are just bloodwork, which can be done at quest to avoid RMAs normal monitoring hours (6-7:30 am) The RMA offices open earlier than 6, so if you get there earlier you can be the first patient in line when monitoring starts at 6 Their monitoring and bloodwork is extremely quick and efficient, but there is only one doctor at the satellite offices, so it can get backed up if a lot of people arrive at the same time   Doctors perform monitoring ultrasounds, which is extremely helpful if you have any questions during IVFI am amazed at the number of bad reviews here, but as I read through them, I see most of the bad reviews fall into two categories:1) People upset at the efficient yet somewhat detached system that RMA uses and2) People upset that IVF was recommended or ""pushed"" on them when they felt they didn't need itI am a patient at RMA)   So I can't say that RMA has worked wonders for me, or that I got pregnant there (at least not yet) because I haven't tried that part yetBut I will say this:  if you know you need IVF, if IVF is what you are looking for, RMA-NJ is the place to go   RMA had a financing option that helped make it doable, and after much research on the SART website, the CDC website, and the Fertility Authority website, we were confident that RMA-NJ was the best clinic in our area for freeze-all IVF cycles)So, RMA is indeed like a smooth, polished factory system  Your doctor is behind the scenes constantly checking your lab results and ultrasound results, but mostly you get calls and emails from nurses relaying the doctor's instructions to you -- this is true   Honestly I don't really care about this  Every ultrasound is done by a doctor, not a nurse Every employee - every doctor -- every nurse -- that I have talked to has been patient, respectful, informative, and caring   There's only one thing I don't like about RMA and that is how early their monitoring hours are   I don't like having to be at an office between 6 and 730 every other day, particularly considering that i live really far away   But I'm willing to roll with their system -- why?Because they treat more IVF patients in a month than most clinics see in a year  But what I like about this place is what people are complaining about  The convenience of morning bloodwork/ultrasounds allowed me to never be late for work  I'm not sure why the one reviewer was surprised at a message being left- you were allowed to choose whether or not to have messages left (regardless of their news)   I had a traumatic egg retrieval (a cyst burst and blood pooled in my abdomen- SOOO painful!!)  At first the nurse told me it was okay to be uncomfortable but she also sprang into action when I told her it was comfort it was pain  My specific doctor also called me later that day to check up on me as well as the following day  This place is amazing and I will be forever grateful to them it's called the  RMANJ will help you along that path They are very knowledgeable and they know what they are doing Their staff, doctors and nurses are very cordial As long as they are doing everything in their capacity, we shouldbe thankful to them Only downside, if at all, we faced, is- The finance department The staff if very cordial Also, there is some lack of communication between our insurance company and finance department Everything is sorted now Our heartful thanks to the everyone from this place  Spent months waiting in line for everything from blood draws to saline sonograms  Pick a less crowded clinic and get better careMy wife came home sobbing from her first (and only) appointment with these peopleIt was wonderful experience, I would do it again Had procedure at RMA Somerset surgical office, Nurse Josephine was prompt, explained post instructions This Place is wonderful  I personally did not have good experience, nurse was good but their doctors, staff, financial coordinators not good  They have too many patients and u are treated as a number long waits during monitoring, no personal care, and they do not have individual treatment plan for sure!   To make a very long story shortI would never recommend RMA to anyone! You are just another patient on a conveyor belt to them I would advise you to go to a smaller clinic where you are treated like a human being I can't wait to be done with them Never acknowledged their mistakeThe place if horrible They are so concerned about patient care that some ""nurse"" you don't even know leaves you messages that both your tubes are blocked Do not use these peopleyou'll have to face going up and down deadly 287 early in the morning to wait for hours Find someplace where they treat you like a human and not a lab rat Like most of the patients we were already very frustrated, and quite hopeless when we first walked into RMA office in Morristown The staff at RMA, from the wonderful team of nurses to Sonia (will always have a spot in our hearts) at the front desk, were always so encouraging every step of the way It got even more difficult watching multiple new classes of hopeful parents in the waiting rooms with us We are both so much in love with our little girl that has changed our lives forever All of the hardship, the emotions, and the sacrifice that felt like they would never end are now replaced by laughter, hugs, kisses, and the love of our little girlMy experience with RMA was a very good one Like any big office running a large complex operation, they have a system to get things running smoothly and you, as a patient, are part of the system There are many people there going through the same troubles as you RMA is simply too big They have the resources, and the results to prove that they have indeed helped a lot of people I went to RMA of Englewood a few times but decided to go to RMA of West Orange instead for most of my monitoring  Personally, I preferred the nurses at West Orange Some nurses are sweeter than others, some are more experienced in dealing with human emotions during this difficult process some of us have to go through I went back to RMA to try to have a second baby and this time it simply did not work RMA is a reputable business The customize your treatment according to your blood work, your health status, and they carefully assess your emotional state, and your expectations And some nurses and doctors are better than others at relaying messages over the phone about lab results that are sadly negative I had a weekend nurse told me how my beta markers were negative and while I was trying to get a grasp of this terrible news, she was telling me I still needed to get back for one more blood test But I literally could not hear a word she was saying and she then told me to find the number of the pharmacy I needed to go to get more Endometrium, which I still needed for two more days, and had ran out of I was a wreck and she seem to feel this was the right moment to send me off to find some number to some pharmacy, etc etc Some nurses express empathy better than others But how you can control every staff member's reaction and way of communicating at all times any facility is a bit tricky They have managed to streamline this ivf process in a way that provides the best results for the biggest number of peopleTo make a VERY long story short, do yourself a favor and avoid RMA (specifically the West Orange office) at all costs Not only is it difficult to get a hold of anyone who knows anything (you'll wait on hold, then wait with a nurse to get a hold of someone who knows anything and then you'll end up just leaving a message after all this--what should have been a 2 minute call takes 10) but they are incredibly inept/disorganized They have misfiled codes with my insurance company causing me to have to sort everything out for them, it now appears they've lost blood tests and all the while they've been incredibly inefficient on other fronts I've now switched practices and it's a world of difference to deal with people you can easily reach, who want to handle everything for you and have it done so properly so that you don't have to do their job for themWhile our nurse was very competent our doctor we feel was not  There are no redeeming qualities for RMA  (You'll see that as you work with them you'll find that its all about them and nothing about you)You rarely meet with your 'doctor', you meet with a rotation of medical students and then you will later find out that you need to go to the Basking Ridge office to do the retrievals and insertions by another rotation of people you've never met withYou have to know how each part of the RMA organization works as well as the lingo as RMA takes no accountability and will have you driving the process instead of them  Crazy! Every (and I mean every) interaction with RMA is infuriatingWas very helpful  in my conceiving my 4 year old son  Our interactions were great and thankfully everything worked out  There are some hiccups that I can warn against, but was a smooth practice for nearly of itI have been a patient at RMA off and on for about 2 years  I am writing this review about my experience, not out of frustration for lack of success (although that is true), but out of frustration for how my husband and I are treated by RMAJust to add an update:  we switched practices to The Institute for Reproductive Medicine at St RMA is like night and dayI am a patient with RMA-NJ and love the attention and care that they give  I go to the Basking Ridge office  The nurses in IVF recovery are wonderful  My biggest issue with RMA is directly related to the mistakes the finance department makes  My son just turned 3  I may have had a positive experience because it ended with a baby, however during the whole process I thought they were extremely organized considering the amount of patients  I felt that online training for the shots was sufficientAll Doctor's were very professional!!!  I can't remember my main nurse's name, I don't think she is there anymore because the names on the website don't look familiar, but I remember the nurses in the recovery room in Morristown were very pleasant!  If I was a little younger, I would go back and try for a second!!! They don't educate you on how to administer the shots Are only in it for the MONEY! You are nothing but a number they can care less about I had the meds/ needles but I was having a hard time with administering only the progesterone shots ( all others in the belly were no big deal) I couldn't reach my butt My nurse in charge told me to go to the office where they would do it for me I went, had it done left The next day I went in and the lady exclaimed to the entire waiting room that I "" left without paying for my progesterone shot"" REALLY?Hello HIPA? I was never told it was a charge I called my nurse, and they apologized and said she spoke to my doctor and they were shocked they did that and that for now on the $35 fee was waived So today I go in, wait an hour, for the woman again to tell me I owe them $35 and $35 for each additional shot I told her my nurse spoke to the doctor and that it was waived Go elsewhere where you are treated better and not as a number! Our experience was awful I could go on with other examples of our concerns but this place has taken too much of our time & hard earned money already Bad experienceRMA is one of the top IVF practices in the country It's pretty much them, CCRM in Colorado and a handful of others leading the major developments in the field Not surprisingly, they are one of the highest volume clinics in the country, over 3,000 IVF cycles a year when I went there But surprisingly, the politeness and warmth of the staff if very good The front desk staff is unfailingly kind, especially Miss Harriet in the Somerset office Always a pleasure to deal with him, even during morning monitoring when you know he's busy","My stim prescriptions were initially sent to Freedom Fertility, and I called and scheduled delivery Then I called to confirm a few days later RMA rescinded the prescription, and sent it to a different pharmacy I was not informed of this by RMA My Lupron prescription was sent to the first pharmacy, not the second . if you know you need IVF, if IVF is what you are looking for, RMA-NJ is the place to go .

Honestly I don't really care about this . Every ultrasound is done by a doctor, not a nurse Every employee - every doctor -- every nurse -- that I have talked to has been patient, respectful, informative, and caring . There's only one thing I don't like about RMA and that is how early their monitoring hours are . I don't like having to be at an office between 6 and 730 every other day, particularly considering that i live really far away . But I'm willing to roll with their system -- why?Because they treat more IVF patients in a month than most clinics see in a year . The convenience of morning bloodwork/ultrasounds allowed me to never be late for work . I'm not sure why the one reviewer was surprised at a message being left- you were allowed to choose whether or not to have messages left (regardless of their news)  . I had a traumatic egg retrieval (a cyst burst and blood pooled in my abdomen- SOOO painful!!) . My specific doctor also called me later that day to check up on me as well as the following day .

Also, the Dr called a few hours after we left with test resultsDr Glassner was absolutely amazingI went to MLF after not being able to conceive for 4 years At the end of the procedure, Dr Orris took his gloves off and left the room without any words Leading up to this Dr Orris was flipid numerous times when we had questions After this we decided to switch to Dr Glassner I couldn't believe how dismissive they were as well about my experience They knew my history of endometriosis and should have respected that I was accurately describing what I went though We left MLF at that time to seek fertility treatment somewhere I was respected and listened toMy wife and I went through one month at MLF and refuse to ever set foot in their facility again  Dr Glassner lied to my face about the course of action we were taking, and ended up starting an argument between my wife and I because someone was lying and I had no way to ascertain who it was until after workAfter many years of trying to have a child Dr Glassner was my solution  He is genuine, kind, and ultimately concerned about my wellbeingI started my journey with Dr GLASSNOR in November 2017, Myhusband and I got pregnant with twins in March 2018, we unfortunately lost them on Aug 20, 2018, I would definitely recommend dr glassnor and his team in a heartbeat, you feel right at home with them, it's like one happy familyI saw Dr Glassner over the course of 3-4 months I am currently 8 months pregnant with a healthy boy! When we first found out we had fertility issues we were told our chances of conceiving naturally were extremely low (less than 7%) Right from the start Dr Glassner was open and honest with us about our situation We never felt pressured into any treatments or excessive procedures On top of that they are truly compassionate and invest themselves in your situation  The problem is that my wife is a teacher and has to take off of work to go to their consultationUpdate:We are continuing down the path with MLF Literally the words ""I promise I'll get you pregnant with IVF"" were said and clearly that did not happen Was also told my AMH was a certain level and when tested at another clinic very shortly after, it was much lower The doctor's answer to this was she would give me a discount next time That was a low blow but I understand it's policy I also was permitted to do 7 iuis at $400 a try and never told to stop although research shows we had like an 8% of it working after the third try was unsuccessful Doctors were very nice and seemed to care- just false promises that broke our hearts when it didn't work out and we lost all our savings Dr Orris and Dr Bloom are amazing We were confused due to the many meds that we started and Nikki and Dr Bloom took so much time to explain things to us Dr Orris is so knowledgeable we feel confident this process will result in a beautiful baby for us My partner is an obgyn/ MFM we decided on main line because after researching Dr Orris as well as Dr Bloom we were confident that in the end we'd have a beautiful family  I've gotten a crazy amount of spam calls daily and I am sure it's from this hack as the timeline fitsAmazing practice!

So, two gals told me about Dr Orris, how he help get them pregnant via IUI; he didn't push them into doing the IVF procedure since he thought it wasn't necessary and all they needed was an IUI to get pregnantI was under the care of Dr Glassner for 11 months in 2014  I always felt that I was under exceptional care A Doctor or RN was always available to answer my questions or concerns  On my initial visit, Dr Glassner assured me that I would be able to get pregnant within the year, with some work Dr Glassner was very confident and direct with his plan of action pending my test results Dr Glassner laid out the options for my care and based his recommendations on my family planning goals  After we had 2 failed transfers, we met w Dr Glassner for next steps Dr Glassner and the rest of the staff at MLF are exceptional people  Thank you MLF!  We are so fortunate to have a beautiful baby girl thanks to Dr Glassner and his excellent teamI have been a patient of Dr Glassner's since 2008 when he assisted me and my husband in becoming pregnant with our first son My husband and I were recommended to his practice after trying to become pregnant for a year unsuccessfully The minute Dr Glassner introduced himself and shook our hands, we knew we were in the right place Three successful pregnancies later, we express our gratitude to Dr Glassner and his staff everyday He helped us through each pregnancy and never lost hope They are optimistic and celebrate every positive sign with you I never had a difficult time with scheduling and was always greeted with smiles and even hugs!

Don't be embarrassed or shy, she's seen it all! Sue is a doll, but a little rough at first - get to know her, ask her questions - again, a wealth of knowledge This was all new to us so we trusted in Main Line to direct us to the best course of action When it was not successful we asked what could have went wrong If I had known what I know now I would have left the practice long before we spent so much money and time They got us in within a week for our first appointment  Since you are here, you realize this is a difficult time, that is very emotional, and very costly  You rarely see the doctorSo, unless you are desperate for their donor bank, avoid this group like the plague  There are much better groups out there (e  If we decide to go through egg donor again, we are not using them - the emotional stress is absolutely not worth it I didn't start this process expecting any guarantee of a pregnancy What I did expect was that I would receive the appropriate time and care that I deserve as a patient at this practice This is a large practice,  so you must expect to be treated like a number- therefore, you need to demand attention to receive the appropriate care that is best for you and your family Don't be satisfied with sloppy answers that don't quite make sense- make them do their job  A big part of why this practice has such high success rates is because they are aggressive in treatment, and high-throughput They really are the ones who have to keep things running, and deal with whatever the doctors aren't saying to patients Dr Glassner has a quirky sense of humor once you get to know each other  She is very thorough, maintains a positive and aggressive attitude when it comes to getting to the bottom of your fertility troubles  She gets down to business right away and doesn't waste any time They also helped to maintain a sense of humor about the whole process I could not have asked for a better group of people to help us achieve our goal  We are so thankful that we went to them, and they will be our very first call when we decide we are ready for #2!  Unbelievable that we are hearing from them now, find an ethical provider!I cannot thank him enough for what he did I've been to many Infertility Doctors and once I found him, I knew he was the right choice NEVER let the odds deter you from doing what you know in your heart you should do Also, talk about this with your friends, family, and any one who will listen, because you will LEARN you are not alone Here is my story NEVER let the odds deter you from doing what you know in your heart you should do All I can say is he is highly recommended!! I would go up to complete strangers that looked 40'ish and ask them if they received fertility help to conceive their child  I appreciated the way the options were presented to my husband and me with our needs in mind We initially chose to be aggressive and go straight to IVF  I was well trained in the self-injections This was my first experience with anesthesia and I was nervous Kathy, Marg, Shirl and Allison were fantastic  I suggest letting your partner worry about the finances so that you can concentrate on getting pregnant We were intimidated at first, we had no idea of what to expect I enjoyed visiting their office At that point I had decided to switch my gyn office  After a year of hoping/trying -we are expecting a baby in August:-)  I would recommend them to anyone!! The problem was not on my end The doctor refused to let me try a natural insemination and insisted that I go on Clomid in order to ""assess my fertility"" although the doctor knew that I did not have any reproductive problems Right after that my periods became very light and only lasted about two days Are they kidding me? Now I have to again be emotionally traumatized as I attempt to fight this fee I didn't know about I can't believe that a doctor who ruined my chances of having children now wants me to pay for the storage I never agreed to!

ZERO compassion I am sincerely disappointed in Mainline They get your hopes up and then squash them I was shocked because they had not even suggested that something was not going well They are not straightforward with you Unfortunately these are only a few of my grievances with Mainline, but you get the idea I regret ever choosing Mainline and I wish I hadn't So disappointed I've even gotten to appointments early and bumped into the Dr in the parking lot and she recognized me by face and name and pleasantly chatted as we walked to the office together","The doctors are straight shooters, the appointments might be quick with not a lot of fluffDr Glassner is hands down one of the best doctors in the area Someone always answers the phone and is able and willing to help We'll definitely keep going I had laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis then was cleared to try fertility We met with him and his PA Fertility is always a touchy subject and there's a natural anxiety associated but they do a good job navigating those rough waters Best of luck to you! . This is an absolutely reprehensible practice in the vein of Sam Beauregarde, but never a doctor that I am supposed to be able to trust I will be returning when we are ready for our 2nd child From everyone on the fertility treatment side to the IVF monitoring team- you will not be disappointedWe couldn't even get through the consultation with these folks . I was told, and I quote, We're sorry, we are not open evening hours . When they were unwilling to accommodate our schedules, I was asked if we could have two separate consultations, one for her and one for me . I have still not had an opportunity to speak with the Doctor . I still have no idea what the process is, how much it's going to cost, the risks, the next steps if the this unknown first step doesn't work, etc . Don't be embarrassed or shy, she's seen it all! Sue is a doll, but a little rough at first - get to know her, ask her questions - again, a wealth of knowledge This was all new to us so we trusted in Main Line to direct us to the best course of action When it was not successful we asked what could have went wrong If I had known what I know now I would have left the practice long before we spent so much money and time They got us in within a week for our first appointment . Since you are here, you realize this is a difficult time, that is very emotional, and very costly . You rarely see the doctorSo, unless you are desperate for their donor bank, avoid this group like the plague . There are much better groups out there (e . If we decide to go through egg donor again, we are not using them - the emotional stress is absolutely not worth it I didn't start this process expecting any guarantee of a pregnancy What I did expect was that I would receive the appropriate time and care that I deserve as a patient at this practice This is a large practice, . so you must expect to be treated like a number- therefore, you need to demand attention to receive the appropriate care that is best for you and your family Don't be satisfied with sloppy answers that don't quite make sense- make them do their job . A big part of why this practice has such high success rates is because they are aggressive in treatment, and high-throughput They really are the ones who have to keep things running, and deal with whatever the doctors aren't saying to patients Dr Glassner has a quirky sense of humor once you get to know each other . She is very thorough, maintains a positive and aggressive attitude when it comes to getting to the bottom of your fertility troubles . She gets down to business right away and doesn't waste any time They also helped to maintain a sense of humor about the whole process I could not have asked for a better group of people to help us achieve our goal . We are so thankful that we went to them, and they will be our very first call when we decide we are ready for #2! . Unbelievable that we are hearing from them now, find an ethical provider!I cannot thank him enough for what he did I've been to many Infertility Doctors and once I found him, I knew he was the right choice NEVER let the odds deter you from doing what you know in your heart you should do Also, talk about this with your friends, family, and any one who will listen, because you will LEARN you are not alone Here is my story NEVER let the odds deter you from doing what you know in your heart you should do All I can say is he is highly recommended!! I would go up to complete strangers that looked 40'ish and ask them if they received fertility help to conceive their child . I appreciated the way the options were presented to my husband and me with our needs in mind We initially chose to be aggressive and go straight to IVF . I was well trained in the self-injections This was my first experience with anesthesia and I was nervous Kathy, Marg, Shirl and Allison were fantastic . I suggest letting your partner worry about the finances so that you can concentrate on getting pregnant We were intimidated at first, we had no idea of what to expect I enjoyed visiting their office At that point I had decided to switch my gyn office . After a year of hoping/trying -we are expecting a baby in August:-) . The problem was not on my end The doctor refused to let me try a natural insemination and insisted that I go on Clomid in order to assess my fertility although the doctor knew that I did not have any reproductive problems Right after that my periods became very light and only lasted about two days Are they kidding me? Now I have to again be emotionally traumatized as I attempt to fight this fee I didn't know about I can't believe that a doctor who ruined my chances of having children now wants me to pay for the storage I never agreed to!

76,Main Line Fertility,What went Wrong,Empty,Empty
77,Penn Fertility Care,doctor,"2018 update: Have been back for a quick consultation with Dr Butts She was extremely kind and generous, professional and thoughtful She had performed a procedure for me two years ago and remembered me, and took time with my partner and behaved in a compassionate way You will call and not receive calls back If you do, the person will have no familiarity or concern for your case Which, by the way, will not be updated with current information That's the first and last time I've ever seen that doctor Makes you feel real confident At no point was this explained that it would essentially be billed as a surgery or a procedure Edwards who we saw once in 16 months and another doctor we never even heard of Best part of during the consultation he sat there bewildered by my wife's chart and not understanding what the fuck Penn was trying to do  Were taking our business else where  WeHave an appointment at Mainline fertility w Dr Glassner While we do like our Dr, you rarely get to see your Doc I highly recommend going someplace else if you can I have received successful top-notch fertility treatment in Japan and I felt that my experience here was merely so-so at best I saw Dr Divya Shah at Radnor several times  as we were having trouble conceiving our second As opposed to one of the doctors at Shady Grove who was extremely pessimistic and basically said there wasn't much he could do to help me and that I had a 'really tough case' Funny how I was pregnant without any assistance within 2 weeks of that consultation Dr Shah had a MUCH better understanding of how to approach diminished ovarian reservelong story short I asked her if am I gonna be able to have a healthy baby from our own?do we have everything normal? and she said my husband morph is abnormal but just a little bitI feel like they just want to get the money first and don't care about our feelingsWithout going into too much detail, let's just say that due to our age and due to the nature of our problem, we probably had around a 20-30% chance of carrying a pregnancy to full term In fact we changed fertility clinics to Penn because our previous doctor (who shall remain nameless but let's just say he was based at Bryn Mawr Hospital) didn't have a very good manner of explaining this to us We were well aware of the odds against us, and he basically acted like he was doing us a favor by even trying to treat us because chances are it wouldn't work You see, there is a way to explain these things in a realistic manner, yet do it in a positive way to encourage instead of discourage We truly felt like the staff was rooting for us instead of treating us like we were a burden due to our circumstancesFirst thing I'd like to say is that anyone looking for fertility intervention should read 'Making Babies' by Sami S David & Jill Blakeway The first chapter is all you need to read to understand what is happening at Penn Fertility Care The results were given to me right after it was done as I was sitting in front of 4 strangers (not sure why 4 people needed to be in the room) I was obviously completely devastated and very little compassion was doled out However it was the upsetting results and the massive amount of bleeding following the procedure that told me that I really should have had someone bring me I had ridden the train for god sake! My main takeaway from this experience - do not go alone to an HSG! My husband and I were then told on our next visit that our absolute only chance of conception was IVF My husband and I left stunned with disbelief that creating life has come down to this type of commercialization I have integrated supplements, diet changes, acupuncture (Cara Frank is amazing), mayan massage (Jennifer Harrison is awesome), and a few other things into my life This time it hurt unbelievably bad, but showed that both fallopian tubes were completely open! Even though I had done the work to get them open, I still had a hard time believing it Now it has been a couple months and we are crossing our fingers and toes for a positive test result  In that time, I met almost every doctor, but as I was considered a patient of Dr Edwards, it was he who I mostly saw (and he who followed up with me when necessary)  But the empathy and personal attention from Gloria, Brooke, and (I am so sorry that I don't recall her name) the other woman who were the ultrasound team at the 8th/Walnut group was amazing  I loved how honest the doctors and nurses were- at some fertility practices, they are all ""sunshine and roses"", and while I appreciate that some people need a team that will tell them gentle lies to make them feel better, I needed a team who was going to be honest about my chances, and cut to the chase The doctor seems that he cares about only money, gave me unnecessary surgery As I want to know what the polyps are, no body would like to tell me I've had a good experience with Dr Barnhart and his nurse after switching from Main Line Fertility due to canceled cyclesDr Barnhart switched my protocol, which was successfulDr Coutifaris performed my retrieval and showed his sense of humor by writing the number of embryos retrieved on my hand Dr Dokras performed my transfer and was very thorough talking me through everything I've also worked with Dr Butts before for my laparoscopy They tell you a sample must get there within an hour so why is that not the case this time???!!!! On another occasion I had a nurse laughing when we were talking about my infertility I was treated like just a number - get the tests then straight to IUIMy husband and I went to see Dr Dokras for infertility treatment We had a terrible experience with Dr Dokras We would not recommend this facility There are many great facilities out there that will treat you with the respect and care you deserveI have to leave a review for this practice, because my experience has been nothing like the previous reviewer  My doctor is Dr Dokras  These fellows are all currently physicians in the field and they have wonderful bedside manner- something that is EXTREMELY important if you are a fertility patient)Before you dismiss this office due to the previous review, please check it out yourselfThis is meant to be scathing, and not meant for Dr Butts, whom I wish was our assigned doctor, and a few very kind nurses We could almost never get in touch with a doctor or nurse when we wanted to, and the times we could were rushed off the phoneThe final straw: A test showed that a Fallopian tube might have a blockage, meaning the the procedures we had done were quite possibly a complete waste of time, tears and money: and the doctor NEVER told me At that, my husband and I went to Shady Grove Fertility and are thrilled with the switch Go to a clinic with human decency during this incredibly emotional, trying timeI received respect and superb care from the front desk staff to the doctors My main Dr was Dr Barnhart who was wonderful, but I received care from Dr Butts, Dr Dokras, and Dr Coutafaris (name misspelled), who's the head doctorAfter getting the run around from MainLine, who could've changed my protocol immediately but figured they milk the money off my insurance since it paid for IVF, Dr Barnhart reviewed my history and changed my protocol and everything went smoothly Dr Dokras let me view the screen during my transfer and explained everything step-by-stepIt is just cute how all negative reviews of this practice are dismissed under ""Not recommended"" I have never experienced doctors actually take the time to get to know you and really care about you! I have had NO health problem after donating!!! Love them  We are a same-sex couple that needed an egg donor and surrogate  Dr G was also a gem when helping us work through some less than typical situations that arose  She made herself very available throughout the processes as we needed her  That was incredibly appreciated during what is a very emotional process  We ultimately had a successful pregnancy on the first try and had a baby within a year of our first visit to the clinicMy interaction with one of the doctora as this practive left me feeling dismissed and unvalued  Whenever the discussion of IVF came up, and I informed this dr that it was not an option for me- he would shut down  When I told him i had to visit ER two days prior due to an unusual discharge, he first told me to stop taking the antibiotics, then told me to keep taking them, have intercourse that night, and call them to let them know if the issue persisted  We are already extremely distraught after experiencing miscarriages, and failed IUI's  While the doctor (DrButts) is very knowledgable, you will barely get to see her ever, and when you do, she will rush through the interaction and leave you with questions and concerns afterwards  We went there for about 8 months and they barely ran any tests on me or my husband  I only saw the doctor once or twice, usually it was the nurse, and the dr  I asked to try fertility meds one month (they didn't recommend them or even mention them to me) and the nurse gave them to me without any explanation  I felt completely alone and unmonitored I'm in the middle of my treatments with them so am not pregnant yet, but I have never considered going anywhere else-- I don't get the sense that they are all about numbers, I think they care about individual patients and cases, and they try to develop a protocol that will work for you as an individual The doctors are all excellent-- we've gotten treatments during some very inclement weather meaning that doctors had to switch around schedules-- and they were always available for us","WeHave an appointment at Mainline fertility w Dr Glassner While we do like our Dr, you rarely get to see your Doc I highly recommend going someplace else if you can I have received successful top-notch fertility treatment in Japan and I felt that my experience here was merely so-so at best I saw Dr Divya Shah at Radnor several times . as we were having trouble conceiving our second As opposed to one of the doctors at Shady Grove who was extremely pessimistic and basically said there wasn't much he could do to help me and that I had a 'really tough case' Funny how I was pregnant without any assistance within 2 weeks of that consultation Dr Shah had a MUCH better understanding of how to approach diminished ovarian reservelong story short I asked her if am I gonna be able to have a healthy baby from our own?do we have everything normal?

We ultimately had a successful pregnancy on the first try and had a baby within a year of our first visit to the clinicMy interaction with one of the doctora as this practive left me feeling dismissed and unvalued . Whenever the discussion of IVF came up, and I informed this dr that it was not an option for me- he would shut down . When I told him i had to visit ER two days prior due to an unusual discharge, he first told me to stop taking the antibiotics, then told me to keep taking them, have intercourse that night, and call them to let them know if the issue persisted . We are already extremely distraught after experiencing miscarriages, and failed IUI's . While the doctor (DrButts) is very knowledgable, you will barely get to see her ever, and when you do, she will rush through the interaction and leave you with questions and concerns afterwards . We went there for about 8 months and they barely ran any tests on me or my husband . I only saw the doctor once or twice, usually it was the nurse, and the dr . I asked to try fertility meds one month (they didn't recommend them or even mention them to me) and the nurse gave them to me without any explanation . I felt completely alone and unmonitored I'm in the middle of my treatments with them so am not pregnant yet, but I have never considered going anywhere else-- I don't get the sense that they are all about numbers, I think they care about individual patients and cases, and they try to develop a protocol that will work for you as an individual The doctors are all excellent-- we've gotten treatments during some very inclement weather meaning that doctors had to switch around schedules-- and they were always available for us"
78,Penn Fertility Care,advice,"2016: University of Pennsylvania Fertility is a disaster I promise you will never see ""your"" doctor, you will probably never see the same doctor If you disregard reviews and decide to go anyway be very sure to ask every question you can think of about every step of the process They will not help you, they will not advocate for you, they will not go the extra mile My wife chose Penn and unfortunately I didn't read the google and yelp reviews We waited 3 months to get an appointment with Edwards So the first unpleasant surprise She doesn't have a medical history that would lead to this happening and they offered no explanation how this would occur Mind you we're operating under the assumption that she can't get pregnant if she's right side dominate The nurse walks in celebrating apparently not knowing that my wife's right side tube is blocked (once again it wasn't, but unfortunately we had no clue thanks to the medical experts at penn) I almost lost my shit and snapped at this woman I work in sales for a living, I never go into a meeting with a client not knowing every piece of info we have on them But it gets better There goes another 120 dollars So we should waste a procedure that we have a limited number of that won't work???? Also you don't even know if she already ovulated Have had 4 visits and every-time I see the actual doctor Also figures out my wife's tube wasn't blocked Seriously run the fuck away from this place  They are primarily sales pl not likeDocs normally arePoor communication and disappointing experience overall I wish I had read these reviews instead of trusting other people's opinions Look into other places with a better reputation She did a fertility work up and although I have some major potential issues she remained optimistic I guess that's what happens when your more focused on your job and helping precooked and not just the bottom lobe i called and asking for explanation but no one call back until I emailed the embryologist she said I have to talk to dr Very discouraging I went there in February of 2016 We stayed for the IVF lecture that night We were given a sales pitch that would make a used car salesman salivate The words ""you get 5 doctors for the price of 1"" actually came out of the mouth of Dr ButtsI looked into other options on my own and proceeded with many types of natural therapies One good resource is natural-fertility-info I could feel the changes in my body and my period I have complete respect for any path a person takes to parenthood, but I want to let people know that sometimes these fertility clinics do not have the best intentions or are just not informed of all ways possible for women to become mothers Trust your intuition and make sure you feel completely comfortable with the course of action the doctor wants to take, otherwise you will be left with complete disappointment  I will never forget Gloria holding my hand and crying with me when I had a loss  I searched the medicine online, as one of these side effect happens, patients should notify the doctor and stop the medicine immediately In fact, nobody will tell you This practice is a disgrace We had and continue to have a very high opinion of Penn Fetal Medicine She was uneducated and unsympathetic to our needs After our initial appointment with her, we decided to go to another fertility center in Philadelphia We were shocked and disappointed with the lack of knowledge, attention and sensitivity that we experienced hereThe reason you do not always see the same doctor is that UPenn is a teaching hospital and this office has a fellowship program for doctors who are becoming instructors  On most visits you will see a fellow, but you will also see your own doctor as well  You can also request to only see your doctor if that is preferred  I always have detailed instructions and a plan  (something that is also very important for fertility patients They ran the standard battery of tests, charged us twice for most, and never explained anything I looked up the report and researched every unfamiliar medical term until I interpreted the report myselfI've switched from MainLine Fertility to here and it was a wise choice Some of them actually contain valuable points, now that I am a patient there myself ""Stay on 450 units"", when your dose is actually 300 units, so PREPARE TO DOUBLECHECK their every step Or so I thought when less than 24 hours before my last retrieval they told me they have no donor sperm prepared for me Prepare to a lot of stress and omissions  During the next conversation his reply was - so you're just going to go with nature's course  His bedside manner was unprofessional;  upon a pelvic exam, he never advised me of inserting the speculum , or his fingers You will be run through lengthy trials that are known to fail, before they finally prescribe correctly And to top things off, if you are expecting results, you basically have to call/bug them Avoid if possible  Very little oversight  I did have one initial visit at Radnor, which is where I had wanted to do some of my care (and per their website, locations are interchangeable - yeah, right!)  Having come from another fertility practice where I saw a doctor during each visit, it was a shock to never see my doctor, a doctor, or my nurse during most visits  While I could have been more comfortable with this arrangement if I felt that I had easy access to my nurse or doctor in other ways, I felt disconnected from my care and without power to ask simple questions and get feedback But, since they really didn't have much sway in my regular visits with this office, I had to give 1 star  You should wait and you better not ask questions  She barked at me almost every time I came  She singlehandedly made my visits incredibly frustrating and unpleasant (which were already stressful b/c I was undergoing FERTILITY treatments - duh!)  If you have a choice, I suggest that you RUN to another practice!  (Try RMA)","Also you don't even know if she already ovulated Have had 4 visits and every-time I see the actual doctor Also figures out my wife's tube wasn't blocked Seriously run the fuck away from this place .

80,Penn Fertility Care,clinic," Individually, many of the nurses, doctors, residents, and receptionists are extremely competent and kind, however as a system, the place is run like the DMV in the 1980's If you have specific medical concerns, you will need to remind every single medical ""professional"" of them, because they will not read your chartRun, seriously run I have never dealt with a more incompetent group of people in my life For 14-16 months we discussed treatment plans with a revolving door of nurses My wife comes in and yay follicle on the left side They tell us come back 2 days later so we can measure the follicle again 2 days later and now the right side is dominate Now once again with the revolving door of nurses The nurse looks at us and says, well come back into 2 more days and we will check again So 2 days later back in the office and now magically the left follicle has disappeared and they don't know if my wife ovulated  That was our last visit We chose a different fertility clinic, one that's highly recommendedHorrible experience  I definitely wouldn't return to Penn fertility  He's supposed to be the best in this area  I'd steer clear of Penn unless you want your appointments to be more like dealing a salesman at the gym My wife asked the nurse to confirm this since she normally takes it at 18mm, the nurse confirmed 5:15  PM she gets a phone call from a different person ""confirming her instructions"" (which they have never done before), and those instructions are to take the shot on Saturday Just awful customer service in an already tough situation This is not our first negative experience with Penn Fertility My experience at Penn Fertility was very mediocre at best There was nothing to rave about at this clinic I sincerely regret not going to a different clinic with better reviews  If you are considering Penn Fertility, don't do it The communication at this place just isn't what it needs to beI should've search and read about this all bad review before I went to penn fertility clinic barnhart and apparently I only spoke couple times before I start the ivf program and after that everything is all nurse Top it off with the errors his staff were making during our care there, and our experience stunk at that location We researched and decided to switch to Penn The doctors we dealt with at Penn were excellent at this And the bottom line Despite the odds against us, our healthy son was born last month due to the care we received from Penn I had no issues with their staff, everyone seemed very professional and actually a bit rehearsed I did feel a bit like a science project as on my first visit I had a ton of blood taken for testing and a transvaginal ultrasound and was scheduled for an HSG the next day The worst part was I had come alone as I was told I could because it was a simple outpatient service I will have to say the procedure was actually done very quickly and smoothly with no pain, which it is apparently rare not to have pain, which I would later learn This past February (1 year later) I scheduled another HSG with my gynecologistI first would like to say that I mostly went to the 8th/ Walnut offices (except on holidays or weekends when I went to 3701 Market St)  I felt like they were compassionate and empathetic, and their support staff was excellent  Over all of my treatments, I got to know the women who did the ultrasounds, the blood draw staff, and the nurses The blood draws were always painless at 8th/Walnut, and the nursing staff was professional and compassionate  You can train people to do their jobs efficiently, but you cannot train people to be as loving and caring as those women were to me  The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars, by the way, is because I didn't feel the same amount of professionalism at the Market St location  Although, I really only went there on holidays and weekends, so they may have had a staff during the week who was also fabulous  But I always waited for ages at the Market St location- including one day when I was completely forgotten about when I was there for a monitoring appointment  But always, once I was seen, I was treated with professional courtesyThey are not that great as I thought As I called the nurse to notify the severe side effect, heavy bleeding and belly pain) and asked if I could stop the clomid, she said continue and take some ibuprofen if feel pain They are so unprofessional The nurses there are not friendly at allThey are not helping, they are destroying your reproduction system with a lot of bills too His nurse showered me with compliments and sympathy after the loss When I didn't return for a 7 week ultrasound, she checked up on me When I called the office with numerous questions a nurse always answered Especially to those with endometriosisDO NOT GO HERE!!! I went for an IUI only to be told 20 minutes later that a doctor was not there and that I needed to go to the city This place needs some serious sensitivity and professionalism training I have never  been treated with such disrespect and lack of compassion during what is a very stressful and painful time We were referred by Penn Fetal Medicine who we had a fantastic experience with We have had an amazing experience at the other fertility center  I have been a patient at the office for two yearsThere are actually two head receptionists, Madeline and Teresa- both who have been incredibly kind to me in my many interactions in person and over the phoneYes- I have waited over 25 minutes on occasion, but that is NOT the norm  On most visits, including visits to get blood work, I have only waited about 5 minutes  In my experience, the fellows are thorough, communicative with me and the attending physician and compassionate  However, I have found that seeing more doctors has been great for me, as they are working as a team to care for me  You may love it, like me! The majority of Penn Fertility staff, however, treated my husband and I terribly during a really difficult time The receptionists were often rude, unintelligent and unhelpful Though we left the practice in December, we received several harassing, enormous bills, which we have just resolvedPenn will abuse and try rob you I would've given 5 stars if the wait time was better and they offered 7 a lab time in their officeThe overall level of service there is VERY uneven At first, I gave the place the nickname ""Hot mess with a happy ending"" They will completely forget you are coming fro your initial appointment, and casually show up 45 minutes past scheduled time, having not reviewed your chart With that, they are pleasant, their heart is in the right place, and their system is overall effective That means, that my airhead nurse just did not bother to check until it was less than one day before the procedure, on a Sunday afternoon Honestly, that was a bit too much to take Again, in the very end, they found the sperm and did the procedure, but until the last minute, gowned up and with the IV in, I did know if the procedure is still happening With that, they still achieve results, and are the closest group for Center City people geographically which becomes important when you do US and bloodwork every other day People I liked: Drs Shah, Kalra, Garcia; nurses Erin and Rie (both VERY professional), US tech -- I think her name is Julie? The receptionist actually treated me very nice and was very accomodating of my needs (I had to take an early train and thus cut the line a coupla times) Keeba the biller is also very approachable and helped me with wrongly filed bills And they are amazing!!!

I mean if I knew it from the beginning I would not start my ivf program, we gonna fix our issue first and continue after that The HSG performed showed that both of my fallopian tubes were blocked I had mostly normal other results, but because I was 38 I should hurry into the process  I went for almost three years- multiple IUIs, and several losses  I will always remember their cheers when I finally ""graduated"" with my successful pregnancy actually the doctor is lack of the basic knowledge and scripted clomid he should not since I have thyroid disorder and fibroid, Then, as I took the clomid twice, got heavy bleeding, two cys (one is very big 3 cms), and no ovulation waited for three months to get my period back, and fibroid grew crazily after took clomid, FSH is doubled, My AMH is dropped by 60% (clomid speeded up using my egg reserve) In fact, the doctor should not script the hormone for me because levothyroxine  for my thyroid disorder should not be taken with clomid, which won't lead to ovulation and actually result in heavy bleeding as I want to know the ultrasound results as the clomid mess up my uterus and ovary, they said why you wanted to see the ultrasound results, go home, a nurse will call you and tell you everything Although my IVF pregnancy ended in miscarriage, he was a pleasant RE to work withI would recommend them Unfortunately, this is not the one of them I'm 4 days past my 3 day embryo transfer With severe endo, and issues with high estrogen and low ovarian reserve at 34-yrs-old, Dr Dokras transferred 2 grade 1 8 cell embryos I'm expecting a positive pregnancy test next week They will miscommunicate with each other They will occasionally give you a wrong dose of the med -- iI am an egg donor there  One comment was - well even if there is something we can fix, at your age, you just may not get pregnant  Even though I am not prusing IVF, and I will believe that the practice is one of the best in the country, I would not recommend Dr Sondheimer Especially when you have to do this multiple times in a week didn't even call me after I had an HSG  They do not do blood tests or ultrasounds throughout the month The other reason for my low rating is the receptionist","I mean if I knew it from the beginning I would not start my ivf program, we gonna fix our issue first and continue after that The HSG performed showed that both of my fallopian tubes were blocked I had mostly normal other results, but because I was 38 I should hurry into the process .
