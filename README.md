## Fertile Crescent


Finding assisted reproductive care is an important and expensive decision. The average cost of an IVF cycle is between $12,000 and 25,000 without insurance and often more than cycle are required. Additionally, more than half of Americans are not covered for IVF care. This makes selecting a clinic to receive care a critical decision. 

Currently, there is no place to find the historical success rate for clinics around the country. Fertile crescent is a webapp to help visualize the predicted success rates for clinics in the future making use of Bayesian Marginal Likelihood analysis and recommend the top clinics in the country to seek care.
