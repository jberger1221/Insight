0,0,Columbia University Fertility,5 star rating,"Columbia University Fertility center is an excellent fertility clinic as they have wonderful team of doctors. We were seen by Dr. Paula Brady at the Columbia University Clinic. She is an excellent doctor, who treats her patients at a very personal level. Dr. Brady took care of us and everything worked great for us.The Clinic as a whole is also very good as it is open to patients on holidays, weekends, and even the new year holiday. The entire team of Dr. Brady is very helpful, professional and listens to patient concerns with care and these issues are properly taken care off. Even when you call them at a very short notice, they get back to you quite quickly.I wish I could give them more than 5 stars and especially to Dr. Brady, who is an excellent consultant and above all a great human being. I would often bother her with issues, which may not be of great significance but she would always get back very quickly either through email or phone. She would even reply emails on Sundays. She considers her patients as humans, understands them and design the program accordingly for each patient individually based on the specific requirements of the patients. She prepares a road map for a patient and follow it up till the end, which I really liked about her. There is nothing ambiguous about her plan, she makes everything simple and clear.I would especially mention that even during this stressful Corona pandemic, she really managed everything so well and she ensured that I wasn't effected by it in anyway, for which I am really grateful to her. She is an expert of her field and very knowledgeable care provider in her field of expertise. One can be inspired in many ways from her.God has deputed some angels in the form of humans and she is one of those angels working to help distressed people at a very personal level. We felt honored to have been her patients. She makes you very comfortable during the entire procedure and ensures that you are not stressed during any phase in any way.While going through all this, you don't only need medications but you also need support and kind words from your medical team as well. So, when I felt low or felt nervous on some issue, I would contact Dr. Brady and she would reply that ""it's fine"" or ""it will get better"" or ""its pretty normal"" made me feel great, even if I were not feeling good earlier. These words may seem pretty simple in normal English but believe me, coming from your physician when you are in distress works wonder and Dr. Brady is great in communicating them in such a way that these lines would act as healer for me. The way Dr. Brady used to say those things made my body believe that ""its pretty normal"" and it is very important in this treatment.If anyone is considering a fertility program, I would sincerely advise to consult Columbia Fertility and look for Dr. Brady as she is the best resource. And one last advice, when you become her patient, trust on her judgement and her team and believe me "" It will get better"".",5
1,1,Columbia University Fertility,5 star rating,"There aren't enough words to describe how amazing Dr. Eric Forman and the staff at Columbia Fertility Center are. My husband and I have been trying to conceive for years but was not having any luck. It all changed when we met Dr. Forman. Dr. Forman broke down the process step by step for each procedure and made sure all was understood. Overall, the process was lengthy, but we were able to conceive on our first round of IVF. Dr. Forman always took his time explaining, answering our questions, and never made us feel rushed. I was able to contact Dr. Forman at any time and always received a quick reply whether by email or by phone.The atmosphere at Columbia Fertility Center is warm and welcoming. Its the nicest atmosphere I have ever experienced in a doctor's office.Thank you, Dr. Forman, for helping us become parents of an amazing baby boy.",5
2,2,Columbia University Fertility,5 star rating,"We had an amazing experience. First of all the whole place had a positive and light energy. The entire stuff was always smiling. Everyone was on point I didn't have to remind or explain anything to anyone. It felt like everything was done for us. No stress no confusion. We didn't know what to expect when we first decided to go to the fertility center. But honestly it all went so smooth and hustle free. I had no confusion I knew what to do next every step of the way. This was probably the most non-overwhelming doctor experience I have ever had. Long story short, after several months we had a successful IVF in the first try :) Every doctor we worked with was incredible but our favorite by far was Dr Brady. We are definitely coming back for baby #2 :) Dr Brady was incredibly knowledgeable, professional, supportive and super sweet. She was always in touch and her entire team was on top of everything. We were always updated the same day after our appointment. After such outstanding level of care and professionalism I decide to switch all my doctors to Columbia doctors!",5
3,3,Columbia University Fertility,5 star rating,"I had a great experience with Columbia Fertility  doctors and staff over a couple of years.  The staff was so friendly they felt like extended family while going through the ups and downs that can occur with fertility woes.  All who I interacted with were attentive and responsive- from the front desk staff, nursing staff, back office staff and the doctors.  Over the course of two years there were many who I interacted with and I would call out their names but I don't want to leave anyone out! It was a happy day to ""graduate"" and be released to my ob gyn with hugs and high fives from the staff and Dr Forman!  Fast forward to almost a year later and I'm a first time parent to a happy and healthy baby girl... thanks in part to the efforts of the former CWRC aka Columbia University Fertility. I'm happy to have chosen Columbia to address my fertility issues years ago!",5
4,4,Columbia University Fertility,5 star rating,"We had a wonderful experience at Columbia University Fertility Center. Dr Karipcin was amazing and we were lucky to have her. She's a caring and compassionate doctor.  She answered all my questions and concerns. She was very supportive of me going forward with IVF, so we felt very confident under her care. We will definitely go back to her if we decide to have a 2nd baby!",5
5,5,Columbia University Fertility,5 star rating,"My husband and I decided on Columbia after stumbling upon an insanely high review of Dr. Forman via a blog post (and then further review stalking on Fertility IQ). Dr. Forman and the entire Columbia Fertility staff are the nicest people you'll ever come across throughout your fertility journey. The office space is bright and clean, the employees are constantly smiling, no matter what time of day it is, and the communication process cannot be beat. The wait time for appointments is either nonexistent or extremely low considering other doctors offices I've been too. Dr. Forman is an open book and has the fastest response rate of pretty much anyone I've ever emailed with, period. No question is dumb or too small for him. He gets how stressful of a process this is for you and truly does everything he can to make you feel as comfortable and well informed as possible. A few specific logistical perks of Columbia are that they make morning monitoring appointments for you (as opposed to first come, first served, walk-in time frames which is how a lot of other places do it). Additionally, procedures are done on-site in the back surgical room (as opposed to going to the corresponding hospital which is also how other places seem to do it). Finally, instead of taking an injection class, we were able to sit down one-on-one with a nurse to go over the process. These are little things, but make a huge difference throughout the experience. No matter what route you end up taking to get pregnant, there are a ton of appointments involved. Columbia really has thought about all of the intricacies and has done a great job making it as streamlined as possible for patients. A million thank you's to every single person we crossed paths with at Columbia- we are forever grateful for all of you and will definitely be back for baby #2!",5
6,6,Columbia University Fertility,5 star rating,"It took us 4.5 years to get pregnant! I had some uterus issues, and we did 2 egg retrievals and 3 embryo transfers (3rd one worked!). We've been with Columbia this entire time, and couldn't be happier with our decision. They make you feel welcome, they are fast, and they communicate well. Of course there were bad days, hormonal days, sad days, but through it all my care team was supportive! The nurses smile at you and they try to all learn your name. Dr. Sinem Karipcin (Dr. K) was positive, warm, and laughed with us through the good and bad times! I could not recommend Columbia more. The only downside is that I WISH that Dr. K could be my OBGYN and deliver my baby!",5
7,7,Columbia University Fertility,1 star rating,Doctor was all talk no action.  Spends a lot of time detailing plans but then doesn't actually follow through.  No thanks for this place.,1
8,8,Columbia University Fertility,5 star rating,"My husband and I came to Columbia Fertility after having a terrible experience with another fertility doctor in Manhattan who made me feel old and defective. When we arrived at Columbia Fertility, we were impressed with the facility. It was welcoming, bright, and new, everything you want from a clinic. The receptionists were all nice and pleasant. The wait for appointments and morning monitoring was never long. The nurses and technicians became like friends. They were supportive and friendly, at a time when you really need to see a smile. Dr. Karipcin was our doctor and she was amazing. She is a smart, competent, and dedicated professional. She answered all our questions, answered our emails promptly, and was always positive. Once, when she was done with a procedure with a different patient, she quickly came to see me to personally review my ultrasound and speak to me. She is just a wonderfully compassionate and warm person. We were so lucky to have worked with her. She will always be a part of our family. We can't recommend her enough.",5
9,9,Columbia University Fertility,5 star rating,"We had a wonderful experience here, primarily because of dr Brady. From the very beginning till the end, she was very knowledgeable, attentive and considerate, and she was always easy to talk to and responded to our questions both in person and via email. Thank you doctor!",5
10,10,Columbia University Fertility,5 star rating,"The Columbia Fertility Center has been amazing! I started seeing them less than a year ago for IVF and they have been very helpful every step of the way. I was specifically a patient of Dr. Forman and his bedside manner is exceptional. I frequently emailed him serious and silly questions and he always answered quickly. In addition he makes it very clear that he cares about your overall health. Even on days he wasn't scheduled to perform certain procedures, he made it a point to be there anyway for his patients. During the monitoring phases of IVF you may not always see your doctor but that never made me feel uncomfortable because they were all warm and supportive of your concerns.  A lot of women use this center for their fertility and it's incredible how the office is able to manage it. I have never sat in the waiting room for a long time, even when it is busy. They are great!",5
11,11,Columbia University Fertility,5 star rating,"My husband and I had the good fortune of being connected to Dr Forman during our journey through conception. From the day we met with Dr Eric Forman it was all positive and promising. We have never met with a more attentive, caring, compassionate and empathic doctor and facility. Columbia university fertility center has the most inviting caregivers. We are blessed to be associated with them and Dr Forman. Both my husband and I have been very demanding in our attention from the doctor and his team and we got nothing short of it. Instead, they have given us more than promised at every appointment with respect to their time and answers to every question that we had. The best team to go to if you're looking for the right doctor for IVF. Can't thank you all enough.",5
12,12,Columbia University Fertility,5 star rating,I had a great experience with Columbia Fertility and would highly recommend to anyone. Dr. Rackow and my care team (nurse and care coordinator) were such a pleasure to work with and extremely thorough and informative. I felt like I was in great hands throughout my entire experience. The people at the front desk were always so friendly and helpful.,5
13,13,Columbia University Fertility,5 star rating,"Dr. McConnell was amazing. She was extremely patient with me, answering (in detail) any and numerous questions that crossed my mind. She is passionate about her work, she is rewarded internally when she experiences her patients become moms-to-be.My husband and I are extremely joyful that we had the experience to work with Dr. McConnell, as our fertility specialist. She paid close attention to my body through bloodwork, which directed her to give me an IVF treatment that was catered for my body. The IVF treatment plan worked. Currently we are expecting a healthy baby!!!!!!",5
14,14,Columbia University Fertility,5 star rating,"Dr. Forman and the team at Columbia are among the very best out there. Dr. Forman is the most responsive, accessible doctor I have ever worked with: he always answered emails within the day, sometimes within minutes, and he was willing to have lengthy phone conversations with me to go over any and every question I had. He is extremely knowledgeable and willing to share as much granular information as you need; I always felt I could question the particular reasoning behind a decision to understand it better but also trust his expertise. Dr. Forman always treated me as an individual, as he adjusted my protocols over the course of treatment to get better and better outcomes. While he seems a bit quiet and not super warm/fuzzy at first, he clearly cares about his patients--who else calls the evening before a retrieval to check if you have any last questions and wish you luck??--and goes above and beyond to help. The office also runs smoothly. I never had to wait more than ten minutes for morning monitoring--very important when you're squeezing these many appointments into the early hours before work! IVF is such a stressful experience, and you want to work with experts who will make it as manageable as possible. Can't recommend Dr. Forman highly enough.",5
15,15,Columbia University Fertility,5 star rating,"I cannot say enough good things about my experience with Dr. Forman and the team at Columbia's fertility center. I write this as my two week old naps. We began our journey nervous and very unsure of what to expect. Dr. Forman is everything you could want and more in a doctor. He was professional and informative but also explained everything in language that we could understand. He was positive and reassuring and was ALWAYS available to answer any and all questions. I felt bad emailing him on the weekends because I knew that he would answer within hours and I did not want to take him away from his family. Dr. Forman checked in with the office and emailed me while on his vacation to tell me that my blood test results were positive and that the IVF round was successful. This communication is above and beyond and the whole team at Columbia never made me feel like there was a silly or stupid question. Being a teacher, the monitoring hours worked for me and they were able to accommodate me by giving me one of the first appointments. There were some days that I waited longer than usual to be seen but it did not happen often. While there are many women that go through their offices every day, every doctor and nurse cares about the individual patient. Over the course of my journey, I got to know the staff so well that I felt sad leaving to my regular obgyn. I continued my pregnancy with Columbia doctors and continued to have a great experience. I have recommended Columbia fertility to many people and we are eternally grateful for everything they have done for us.",5
16,16,Columbia University Fertility,5 star rating,"Dr. Rachel McConnell is an outstanding physician. She gives you hope and leaves you feeling confident in her capable and caring hands. We have our family thanks to her!! The new Westchester location is beautiful, state of the art, and conveniently located. And the staff are equally as caring and helpful. We are forever grateful for their help in growing our family!",5
17,17,Columbia University Fertility,5 star rating,"We came to Columbia after reading the positive reviews on Fertility IQ, particularly for Dr. Forman. The reviews have proven to be spot on. Dr. Forman is caring and highly communicative (no other doctor has ever emailed me to keep me informed at each stage), and really takes all the delicate factors (labs, insurance, age, etc.) of a patient's unique profile into consideration. The Columbia team as a whole has been wonderful - from the front desk, to the nurses, to the staff who coordinate medications, everyone has been professional and sensitive, and things have moved along seamlessly. Infertility is physically and emotionally draining, but my husband and I have been able to relax somewhat knowing that they have everything under control here.",5
18,18,Columbia University Fertility,5 star rating,"I cannot say enough great things about this practice. I had a wonderful experience at Columbia Fertility from consultation to conception. As a high risk patient, I was very nervous about finding the right doctor who understood my condition and I had the extremely good fortune of being connected with Dr. Brady who could not have been more caring and thorough. She is *extremely* knowledgeable, answered all of my questions, and has a very comforting bedside manner which is so important. Me and my husband both felt confident that we were in the best hands possible. The office staff, nurses, care coordinators -- they are all so kind and attentive (and the office itself is very relaxing + clean.)",5
19,19,Columbia University Fertility,5 star rating,"Loved all the staff at Columbia University Fertility. They were very helpful and compassionate. From the very first step of receiving information to the end of my process, Dr. Brady along with her team, Sherry and Varda, truly made me feel very comfortable and made the journey much easier.",5
20,20,Columbia University Fertility,5 star rating,"I am extremely happy with this center.  The staff are always courteous and Dr. Paula Brady is amazing.  She has an excellent bedside manner and takes time to explain everything with her patients.  I went for a routine visit and had a general question and she went through the history of my chart to respond in a way that was suited for my individual program.  She really seems to care about her patients and makes sure to go beyond to make sure you are comfortable throughout the entire process.  I have been to 3 different centers and this is by far the most thorough, most courteous, caring and treats each patient as though you are their only patient.",5
21,21,Columbia University Fertility,1 star rating,"They have attempted to re-brand themselves with a new office and new Yelp page, but this is the same old crappy CWRC with a new name. After leaving this agency, I went to New Hope Fertility Center and I'm finally pregnant. I went to Columbia in July 2018, paid over $13K up front for a cycle that ended up not working, and fast forward to Dec 2018/Jan 2019 and I'm still receiving bills from them! It seems like Columbia is trying to double dip! They collected my money up front, and then tried to bill my insurance too. On top of  trying to charge me for monitoring services that I previously paid for before the start of the cycle, they are trying to charge me $1200 for frozen embryos that aren't even normal. Just got off the phone with their billing person and he couldn't even explain why I was receiving bills and told me to call the fixer or customer service person at Columbia. Of course, no one answered the phone upon me calling.p.s. I don't blame Columbia for my cycle not working. Maybe it just wasn't my month. But, I do blame them for not having their billing situation together. I don't need any stress in my life during this pregnancy. Yet, every time I see a false bill from them my stress level goes up. It's really not acceptable.",1
22,22,Columbia University Fertility,5 star rating,I went to this office for the first time mainly due to seeing Jen the pheblemist in the elevator. She expressed to me come up to the penthouse and check it out. I am so happy thus far I did. Also the front desk is so professional and resourceful.Jessica and Edelith was very polite and sensitive towards me knowing the reason why I am coming to see the doctor. Words cannot express my gratitude to Jen.....,5
23,23,Columbia University Fertility,5 star rating,"Dr Forman was one of the best doctors I've every encountered in my life. Incredibly knowledgeable, attentive and warm.",5
24,24,Columbia University Fertility,5 star rating,"I've been a patient here for about a year and can't say enough good things. Dr Forman is the best Doctor.  He's pragmatic, kind,compassionate, so responsive, and super on top of everything. Every person that works here is truly wonderful. The people at the reception desk are amazing. The wait is minimal if at all. They really try to get you in and out as easily as possible. Jenny who takes your blood is so kind and skilled and such a pleasure. The nurses are great. I will be forever grateful to all of these people for everything they've done for me.",5
25,25,Columbia University Fertility,5 star rating,"I would like to recommend Dr. Rogerio Lobo as he is one of the most polite and patient doctor that I have come across. He is also very knowledgeable and would not simply just recommend any invasive procedures. He listens very well to his patient's needs and provide sound advice. I just had my baby girl and if it wasn't for his advice and care, I would not have gone thru some of the challenges and have our beautiful daughter. Thank you Dr. Lobo!",5
26,26,Columbia University Fertility,5 star rating,"Dr. Forman listened to my concerns and is very good with first time IVF patients. Nothing was too small for his attention and he's always doing his best for you. He consistently went above and beyond for me the entire time I was in his care. A perfect example of this was when I had expressed how much I wanted him to perform the actual IVF procedure rather than another doctor from the clinic. The day of the procedure, it wasn't guaranteed that he could make it but he rushed to the clinic and made it happen. I actually teared up when I saw him. These things mean the world to women who have no control over their bad fortune.He and his team understood that these things mattered and what a difference it makes when your concerns are taken seriously. Even the front desk and nurses who draw blood exhibited the same standard of care. Peri, the Egg Donor Program Coordinator, is especially great. She was incredibly helpful and reliable.I can't recommend Columbia University Fertility Center enough.",5
27,27,Columbia University Fertility,5 star rating,"Dr. Williams is the most amazing Dr. He is kind, caring and compassionate. I would highly recommend him and his practice.Everybody is very kind and caring. They are very attentive and available when you need them.He takes his time getting to know you and your needs.",5
28,28,Columbia University Fertility,5 star rating,"We have partnered with Dr Rachel McConnell and so beyond happy with her. She was so patient and  answered all of our questions in detail and thoughtfully always. She paid attention to my bloodwork and scans and was spot on and made sure my protocol fit me. After less than a yr with her we are finally pregnant and graduated from the facility. It was bittersweet and felt strange as we have bonded and felt at home with everyone. Her staff In Scarsdale and the city were just the best. They always made sure they called/emailed me with any information and results and were very sympathetic. I mean from Antoinette from billing to Katrina and Nicole were just always on point. I never felt like just the ""next"" patient but truly like they cared. The morning monitoring was always so prompt in both offices as well. They truly made the experience better as tough as this is experience is. I could go on and on but honestly Dr McConnell was simply the best and so knowledgeable especially with any ideas I brought to her attention. Thank you and I hope to see everyone with my double rainbow baby. Fingers crossed!",5
29,29,Columbia University Fertility,5 star rating,"I live in New Hampshire and feel so incredibly grateful to have been referred to the Columbia University Fertility Center and Dr. Williams. The care that I received from Dr. Williams and his team was unlike any other. They were caring, kind, brilliant, and progressive. Dr. Williams made himself available to me during all hours of the day and expressed the most sincere, intent care. I rarely find a doctor who I feel is just as invested in my case as I am, and Dr. Williams and the group exceeded all of my expectations. From the front desk staff, to the billing team, to the clinical team, we were blown away. Thank you all for all that you have done for our family!  We are truly, truly grateful!",5
30,30,Columbia University Fertility,1 star rating,"OMG this practice thinks they can get away from all their horrible reviews because they rebranded themselves and got a nice lil makeover but this place is still as crappy as it was before. The doctors suck - they don't give a shit and never return your calls. The billing system is terrible - still receiving bills from 2013. This place sucks. Save yourself the aggravation, frustration and heartbreak.",1
31,31,Columbia University Fertility,5 star rating,"My husband and I had been trying to conceive for about a little over 2 years. Unsure of where to begin or how to start this daunting process, we decided to meet with a Dr. at Columbia and essentially took a leap of faith. I ended up doing two (failed) cycles of IUI last year with the Doctor we had first met with at Columbia. After more research, we decided to switch to Dr. Eric Forman for our first (and successful!!) IVF cycle and SO happy we did. He was truly understanding and personable, had amazing communication and response time - no question too inconsequential or too complicated to re-explain and is SUPER informative. All of these qualities separated him from the other doctors in my mind and gave me constant reassurance and confidence that we had chosen the right doctor, staff and facility. I could not recommend Dr. Forman enough!",5
32,32,Columbia University Fertility,5 star rating,"Saw Dr. Forman a few weeks back and very happy with my experience. I previously saw another Dr in Brooklyn, but my experience at Columbia Fertility Clinic was like night and day. Dr. Forman was very thorough and had a great bedside manner. Completely trust his opinions and have switched to him as a result. So happy I was recommended here!!",5
33,33,Columbia University Fertility,5 star rating,"Our whole experience in the center was wonderful! Dr. Forman was so fantastic! Dr. Forman assisted us through every step of this scary and exciting process. He is kind, detailed and always available. He always responded to any question or concern I had within a hour or less even when he was on vacation. All he doctors in the practice we encountered were just the same. His nurse Tiffany is the sweetest and most kind and loving person. She really taker her time to make you feel safe and taken care of. All the nurses in the center who assisted us and did our Lab work (on what felt almost daily) were so professional and kind. Lastly, the front desk team and Tara, always helpful, friendly and attentive. I can't say enough wonderful things of this entire practice! I am so happy we chose Columbia University Fertility! We are so blessed that all went perfectly and we are expecting a baby, May 1st! THANK YOU to the fantastic team or caring professionals!",5
34,34,Columbia University Fertility,5 star rating,"I am so glad that I chose to use Columbia when my husband and I struggled to conceive. Dr. McConnell is brilliant and also kind and comforting throughout what can be a very anxiety-producing process. She is patient with me and answers all of my questions, and I never feel rushed. I mainly see her in the Westchester office, but I have been to the new Manhattan location as well and it's amazing!! I had an appointment with Dr. Forman once when Dr. McConnell was out of the office and he seemed great as well. The process of scheduling appointments is seamless, and I adore all of the nurses, secretaries, and phlebotomists I have interacted with.",5
35,35,Columbia University Fertility,5 star rating,"This place is wonderful! My husband and I received incredibly personalized care from every member of the team. Dr. Forman was so supportive, responsive, caring, and knowledgeable! He was there for us every step of the way and took the time to explain the process. He truly wants to be there for his patients and always answered my questions over email without delay! I was blown away by the amazing level of care - especially after my husband and I had a negative experience with another fertility clinic. So grateful for their entire team!",5
36,36,Columbia University Fertility,5 star rating,"Let me start off by saying that I'm writing this as my 5 week old son is napping in the other room... After seeing many fertility specialists on Long Island and in the city we found Dr Eric Forman. We were only given a 20% chance of successfully conceiving. Dr Forman was compassionate, informative, and supportive. He explained highly complex and technical procedures in plain english. There was not one phone call - during or after hours - which was not returned to us outside of 20 min. We undertook one round of IVF with Dr Forman and were successful - he helped us beat the odds. I can not recommend Dr Forman and the entire team - doctors, nurses, techs, etc - highly enough.",5
37,37,Columbia University Fertility,1 star rating,Had bad experience that lead to emergent surgery as opposed to semi-urgent surgery if diagnosed earlier. Would highly recommend staying away from Columbia .,1
38,38,New Hope Fertility Center,5 star rating,"After 7 years of going to my OBGYN feeling broken and helpless, being diagnosed with PCOS doing the timed intercourse, being given Clomid and Metformin, using OPKs, getting an HSG and being told that it would happen if I gave it time saying they could not physically ever find anything wrong with me I was finally referred to New Hope Fertility center. When I first got to New hope I was impressed by the facility. It was clean and the staff was friendly. The most impressive thing was how thorough they were. It never took over 45 minutes for me to be seen. They sat down with me and my husband and spoke to us about what we've done and what we should do. We got genetic testing done, blood work and another semen analysis for my husband, I got follicle monitoring done every week and bloodwork to check my levels and was told they wanted to begin with The IUI procedure 3 times before I went into IVF. They discussed the cost before even doing any work. The phlebotomist, the nurses and Dr. Makarov were always incredible, and very informative. I never left not knowing what was happening. The IUI procedure was painless and they attempted two rounds per IUI. After the first failed IUI I was broken. I went back and New hope lifted my spirits. They let me know that we would be trying again next cycle. Then comes COVID-19. I thought it was all over but the clinic stays open and checks our temperature at the door, has a nurse pumping hand sanitizer into our hands, the whole staff began wearing face masks and shields, the seats are separated for social distancing. Needless to say I felt safe. I also got pregnant that round. I'm currently 10 weeks and have just graduated and will now be seeing a OBGYN and am pretty sad. I wish that I could stay here throughout my whole pregnancy. The only thing I that kind of broke my heart was the fact that my health insurance duped me and I'll have to pay all my expenses out of pocket. New Hope gave me the one thing I personally couldn't give myself so it's well worth it and a small problem to have. Thank you everyone at New Hope!! You're angels and I'll always appreciate you all. Dr. Makarov, Katherine, Daisy, Oksana, Joanna, Wei, Katie and sooo many more.",5
39,39,New Hope Fertility Center,5 star rating,"So thankful that I made it to NHFC. After 5 IUIs at Weill Cornell, 3 IVF cycles at RMA NY (horrible horrible!) and then finally 2 rounds at NHFC, we are blessed with a beautiful baby girl. Thanks to the lovely Dr. Liu, who took the time to create a personalised stims and implantation plan according to my previous medical history and body cycle. He was always kind, patient and positive, calling me each time he changed the medicine dosage to explain why or when the process did not go according to plan. We used a surrogate and Tiffany, like Dr. Liu, was a sincere cheerleader. I felt taken care of, unlike with other practitioners who saw me with a dollar sign in their eyes and that I was just another battery farm hen. I am so grateful to Dr. Liu and his team for giving me the best gift of motherhood. Please don't give up other prospective parents, it is not a matter of whether or not it will happen, it is WHEN it will happen. Do give NHFC a try. PS. The aquarium in the waiting area is so soothing!",5
40,40,New Hope Fertility Center,5 star rating,"All I can tell any woman who is seeking the finest fertility care in NYC to only go here. Every nurse, my wonderful and amazing Dr., Dr. Makarov, make you feel that becoming a parent is not only possible but can be done treating your body in the best care possible. They understand how fragile and delicate this process is and take extreme care of you from beginning to end. From the first day we arrived at the center, my husband and I KNEW we made the best choice possible. They are so upfront and honest with you about each step and this includes billing. It's your responsibility to inquire about the costs of things and to check your insurance to know what is your responsibility; not New Hope's. They go out of their way to make sure you are clear on things and leave no room for doubt, question or confusion. Did I mention how kind everyone here is?!? It's somewhat surreal. I read some of the reviews of others who gave them a 1 Star review and I'm like how?! Why?! Nothing is perfect, but New Hope is perfect for me. My egg retrieval took place today at 8:30a.m.; the same day NYC officially re-opened and I think it's quite cool to tell my future kids about the day they were conceived. The procedure was pain free thanks to a wonderful  anesthesiologist and the pain afterwards was tolerable. If you want to have an IVF experience that is not conventional but customized to your body only; this is your place. New Hope Fertility was my answered prayer to starting my family and I'm grateful to be on this journey with such an phenomenal place. Also, I'm 39 & went through the Mini-IVF treatment which no one else in the city is capable of providing you with such a treatment besides the experts at New Hope Fertility.",5
41,41,New Hope Fertility Center,5 star rating,"I went to NHFC because after doing some research on doctors in Manhattan, I decided to go with Dr. Jennifer Makarov. I liked the center's philosophy on trying to get quality ovums and blastocysts over quantity to better your chances. I started to get worried about getting pregnant as it was determined I needed several hysteroscopies before being able to implant. But it turns out that I got pregnant on the first try! The staff, including all the nurses, are very nice and accommodating, and the office hours are such that you can come in at various hours making it convenient if you work long hours like I do.My only issue with the place would be that the billing department doles out information in a confusing manner sometimes...But I am giving 5 stars because the most important thing here is getting pregnant, and they helped me have a baby.",5
42,42,New Hope Fertility Center,1 star rating,I am reposting my review with more clarity.  If you freeze your eggs at New Hope Fertility and then want to go to another facility- your eggs will not be accepted.   This is so important for women to know.  Reputable centers will not take the eggs !  Please see attached email photos.  This whole experience is turning into a nightmare. I was seen by Dr Merhi and would not recommend him.   New hope fertility is disorganized- which is the last thing you would want while going thru fertility treatment. I am a doctor and fully understand how a clinic should be run.  Your staff to your billing department are key to your success.  Answering patient phone calls.  Keeping accurate records of payment- these are all important. They do not care. You are just another number and more money.   Please see the discourse I had with the billing manager.  I did not get a response and had to email to get a resp,1
43,43,New Hope Fertility Center,5 star rating,"Wanted to write this review as I sit in the hospital in recovery. I am not only an employee for the last 6 years but also a patient at New Hope Fertility and I wanted to share my story. Not only can I relate but I can sympathize with everyone who is also a patient at New Hope Fertility Center. Yesterday I gave birth to my miracle baby. A baby I thought I would never be able to carry or hold myself. Just early this year me and my husband were discussing adoption or fostering a child/baby. I was just so tired of the constant disappointment and the multiple losses I had suffered in the last 10 years. With Multiple attempts of ivf, surrogacy and my own transfers I was just so tired and unhappy. My husband convinced me to try one last time after we sat in a hot tub with a few drinks in our system during a trip to Dominican Republic in May 2019 I just laughed and I said okay just one last time hun after this we have to move forward with other options even if it meant I would never carry our own child. So that's what I did transferred two embryos in June and here we are with a beautiful healthy baby girl. She's breathing and eating on here own at 5 lbs 15oz and 20 inches long and have her grand entrance at 35 weeks. Just want to thank Dr. Liu from new hope fertility who has helped me through this ivf process the last two years. He is amazing, patient, supportive, compassionate and took such great care of me. We are extremely grateful he has helped bless us with a blessing we thought was never possible. All the staff at New Hope was extremely helpful and efficient throughout my process and I do not only say that because I am an employee I say it as a patient. This process in itself can be extremely stressful and draining so a big thanks to everyone involved for making it easier for me even while working and shedding my tears. Just know as a employee and patient at new hope fertility center I can relate and sympathize with you all!",5
44,44,New Hope Fertility Center,1 star rating,"I went there for an embryo transfer I was planning to have in the coming month. I ended up doing two rounds of IVF because I had a very pushy and convincing nurse and doctor telling me my hormones level were good and I should try this month because I was ovulated. I took this decision because oneI was also told that my insurance was covering IVF so why not and I could have a fresh embryo without taking any medication. Long story short I ovulated to early and they couldn't retrieve any eggs, so I went for another round. The next thing I know I was on different type of hormones and was pushed to accept a genetic testing that cost 750 and was not covered by the insurance. What I did not know is that the cryopreservation was not covered either and costs 1250! I was never mentioned 1) the cryopreservation 2) the cost or even the eventuality it won't be covered. Before the procedure I have asked the billing department of everything was ok and if they received the pre authorization. She said not yet but everything should be covered except the testing. They received the pre authorization 6 days after and the cryopreservation WAS NOT covered and I have know to pay out of pocket. I tried to reach out to the billing department several times but are not addressing my questions nor want to acknowledge the fact that they should have notified me about the eventuality of a cost.I was against the genetic testing and was pushed  to do it. Now that I am thinking about this horrible pushy experience where the doctors wants to make money more than you having a child, I am sure it was done on purpose. I am now  in another fertility clinic in Oradell and it is night and day!!! Also after doing research on New Hope, the way they are handling their business is definitely borderline. In any case I wouldn't recognize this clinic at all and if you have experience similar issues please reach out to me. I would love to investigate further.",1
45,45,New Hope Fertility Center,1 star rating,"This was one of the worst doctor experiences I've ever had. Cannot say enough horrible things about this place. This is very long, but please read because I do not want this to happen to anyone else. When I first met with the doctor she was nice, but talked to me for 5 minutes before doing the ultrasound. She didn't hear anything about history or even ask how often we were having sex (something that I think you'd probably want to start with). When she did the ultrasound she said ""looks like you may have some endometriosis."" That was the end of that conversation. I had to come back for a saline test and I spoke with the nurse who told me to come in before my test results. They made me wait over 2 hours to get a saline test before I had to come in to read my genetic test results. I had asked several people while I waiting to make sure they knew the reason we were there and that we were told to come in before the genetic test reading. They all confirmed and stated that it would only be a few more minutes. Finally, when my husband went up and spoke to someone after 2 hours we were taken in to see the doctor about the genetic results. She apologized about the confusion and said that the test would be performed right away. When I went into the testing room, I told the doctor I was scared because I heard this may hurt. She replied, ""The ultrasound??"" to which I said ...no the saline test. She let me know that I had come in ""much too late"" for that and that I did not follow the instructions that were provided to me. I told her that the nurse asked what day of my cycle I would be on and said it was fine for me to come. She then told me, ""oh, don't listen to her..she doesn't know what she's talking about."" Ok, that's terrifying. She then told me I was just ""uneducated,"" but said that they would still be able to perform this test today magically. Then suddenly, they let me know that they actually would be able to start fertility treatments the following day. This was really shocking because I had been told I needed an HSG test to see if my tubes were blocked but they still wanted to move forward with it. They said I was ovulating and to come in tomorrow morning to start. A few issues, one, I didn't do the recommended tests yet, two, I used an OPK when I woke up the day of the test and I wasn't ovulating (though I know these aren't 100% accurate), third, New Hope won't enroll you in Aetna's fertility program, you. have to do it yourself, but since I wasn't getting the treatment yet I hadn't enrolled so I would of had to pay out of pocket for this but lastly, she had just told me I might have had endometriosis and they weren't even going to look into that? Needless to say, I left there hysterically crying and never went back. They made an already vulnerable situation way worse. We now are going to Kofinas Fertility and it's amazing. The doctor sat with us for 45 minutes to go over our history in detail and now I'm waiting to get help for my endometriosis which they think is the problem before we start fertility treatments. I hate that I had to go through such an awful, degrading experience, however it lead us to Kofinas so it was a blessing in disguise.",1
46,46,New Hope Fertility Center,1 star rating,"I think the fact that they stayed open throughout the entire coronavirus pandemic says a lot about their business and philosophy. Clearly protecting their staff and patients and contributing to the safety of the general public is NOT part of their MO.  Money is their MO.  My dentist closed down her clinic and donated all of her PPE to the nearest hospital.  I left New Hope years ago and I am glad that I did.  It is poorly run and impersonal.  Half of the staff there are nice and courteous and helpful.  The other half hate their jobs and take it out on the patients. There was this one ultrasound tech who was rude, sullen, and dismissive for days until one of her colleagues had to apologize to me saying she was ""having a bad week.""  There is no excuse for that period.  The only part of their staff that is functional, nice, and efficient is their phlebotomists--very professional as a whole and well-trained.  Most of the medical decisions are made by the nurses by some sort of protocol.  It is definitely NOT individualized.  I find it interesting that Cynthia B wrote a great review and she is an employee.  And there are several ""great"" reviews by people who have not written any other reviews (hmmm, could they be biased employees? who have faked an account to sing glories about their place of employment?).",1
47,47,New Hope Fertility Center,1 star rating,"I met with Dr Jackman a couple of weeks ago for an initial consultation. What started out as an ""educational session"" turned into a full blown sales pitch for IVF treatments. Towards the end of the session (after 1.5 hours of a full blown sales pitch), her immediate question was ""What should I put you down for? IVF treatments?""... We haven't even gone through initial fertility testing to see if that is even necessary. A couple of week's later I got a notice from her office to see when I can start a cycle. Again, there was no indication that she had any intention to better understand if fertility treatments are even needed. She was trying to put pressure on the need to start treatments immediately/not waste time and categorized us as ""infertile"" with no warranted facts; she was trying to prey on a couple's fear and failed, miserably, but I can see many couple's trying for a much longer time and easily falling for this tactic.  I would strongly caution anyone looking to start this journey with this practice. Find a Dr that will use proper measures to come up with a non-invasive / cost effective treatment plan.",1
48,48,New Hope Fertility Center,5 star rating,"Planned on writing this review AFTER my procedures, however, decided to do it early.  Though I was very wary of coming here due to the negative comments, I decided to try it anyway because of their ""quality vs. quantity"" philosophy.  I came in with very low expectations for customer service, doctor ""bedside manner"" and the like, HOWEVER, I was very much blown away by how I was treated.  I had my consultation with Dr. Olcha who very clearly drew out diagrams on his ipad and explained EVERYTHING to me and my partner.  I was treated very well by the phlebotomist and the nurse who did my transvaginal ultrasound.  Never had the latter done, but the nurse explained everything about the process as well as what I was seeing on the screen.  Partner and I really enjoyed our experience with the doctor and team.  I then thought, maybe they're nice because it's the first visit.  Nope, I've gone at least a handful of times (even more in the future) and every time had a professional and respectful experience.  When not at the center and I have questions, I send them an email.  My emails are promptly responded to and when I email Dr. Olcha, he emails me back, right away!  I get a faster response from Dr. Olcha than some of my work colleagues, lolz.  I originally was going to do the IUI route, however, will now be doing IVF.  Not sure what the outcome will be, but I have never been more pleased with New Hope.  When I speak to other people about infertility problems, I happily recommend NHFC.",5
49,49,New Hope Fertility Center,5 star rating,"So far I am very happy with this fertility clinic, and it is my fifth one. Doctor Zhang is very attentive and passionate about what he does, he is hopeful and realistic at the same time. He seems to look at my case individually, not just following the same protocol for all, which is what I find to be the case for most clinics, where they treat you like a number, or kettle, no reasoning in mind. If you do the monitoring early morning, then speaking to a doctor is awarded if you ask for it. Their clinic is very pleasant with large windows to Columbus Circle and part of Central Park, and natural light is always welcome while going through hard times. Their system is very efficient as well, which allows for their high demand to not leave us lost in the midst of infertility fog. Good luck ladies, wishing you success, I'm with you on this hard journey!!!",5

Wish me luck! I am writing​ this review because I would like to express my appreciation​ to Dr. Merhi. He really is the best doctor I have met in my life. He is kind, compassionate, having a ​positive​ vibe and very professional at​​ the same time​​. He listens​ to you and proposes​ the best option. Long story short, when I had a problem with NHFC, Dr. Merhi called me to make sure if everything was ok. At that time, I learned​ that he is the doctor that really cares​ about patients​. About the NHFC, I believe it is a good clinic. ​They have​ a great facility​, skilled staff and method​​ to perform a ​ton of success cases. They generally work very quick and efficient. On the other hand, I also agree with other people​ that they can re-organize their structure a bit more. For example, during the procedure, I did not get enough information​ so I needed to google every day​ to understand things. I wish they explain better or enrich the website​ articles and forms. About billing department, I did not have a big issue or cost as I expected the cost as well as I got handout about the fee at the first consultation. However, there are many hidden fees ( which were mostly covered by my insurance so no so big deal). A minor problem was I unless I ask for the ​receipt​, the billing department never sent them to me. Thus for a long time, I did not know how much I was paying. They just charge​d from my credit card.  I hope the ​billing department sends​ receipt​​ every time​ they use my filed credit card. Overall, I definitely​ recommend​ NHFC especially​ they have wonderful​ doctors such as​ Dr. Merhi. Thank you so much and all the best to people who are​ considering​ to go to NHFC.",5
51,51,New Hope Fertility Center,2 star rating,"Update:I used to recommend this place to everyone but they are really struggling to keep up Dr. Zhang is really good at what he does. I've had a (mostly) good experience with them. It is a bit of a factory and you need to take responsibility for raising a flag when you know something doesn't work with your body. I've had to tell them that certain things don't work with the protocol they've given me. I've done a half dozen rounds at this point, so I've learned a few things about my body. I do have to say that their major weakness...and it's a significant one... is their billing department. These guys don't seem to be very good at their job (not submitting to insurance for long periods of time, sending surprise bills a year later) nor are they friendly or responsive. They will outright ignore you - emails, phone calls, messages from the front desk etc... They don't care. If they make a mistake, they will still treat you like the jerk. Their ineptitude has cost the company a lot of money. I know this bc they have been a major barrier as to why I haven't come in for more rounds of freezing. And I'm covered under insurance! Their job should be to make it as easy as possible (and do everything they can to work with insurance) to get people in there. That's how revenue is generated after all. I don't know if the doctors know how much this team is hindering their profits but I hope they see it and figure it out soon. I would give 5 stars if not for the billing team.",2

54,54,New Hope Fertility Center,5 star rating,"If you're trying to get pregnant you're familiar with the things you need to look into: the health of your uterus, your fallopian tubes, and your hormone distribution. I'm a 36 year old woman, was born with only one fallopian tube, a polyp in my uterus that needed to be surgically removed, and a moderate to severe hereditary hormone imbalance.  Let's not even go there with my PCOS. I was hopeless and this was my 3rd fertility center, the other 2 my husband fired, but not before a few thousand dollars were spent in vain. I only had optimism and not really a clear picture on what my issues really were. Dr. Jennifer Kulp-Makarav worked with me, she looked into every crack and crevasse she could and was patient with me. She was always available and the visits were quick, clear and concise with instruction as to what course of action she was taking. Here I am 11 months later I'm finally pregnant, see my baby, and hear his heartbeat via ultrasound..... I froze my eggs there and did Mini IVF. Got 12 more embryos to go so you see they know what they're doing as far as process and most importantly I knew what they were doing each step of the way as well. Look, in a nutshell this is a one stop shop, and if you want to find out what's going on AND get pregnant this is the place. They also work with you regarding the NYS Infertility grant program.  This process was actually affordable too believe it or not. If I have any complaints, it would be the fact that they dont deliver the actual baby lol I dont want to trust anyone else with my miracle but them!!!",5

They were always so pleasant and positive and that kept me motivated.

58,58,New Hope Fertility Center,2 star rating,"I have had success because my case wasn't very complicated. You have to be your own advocate when you are working with NHFC becasue often times you feel like staff/ docs/ nurses that communicate with you do not care.  If you are coming from outside NYC, spending your time and effort traveling, you will often find yourself frustrated because a lot of your questions, be it about the procedures, billing are simply going to go unanswered. Many times, i have had to call, email three/frour times just to confirm that they received my test results and what my next steps were going to be. Often to the point of missing the window of opportunity,. You have to be extremely well informed about the processes and be pesky and ask a lot of questions, unfortunately, to which you may or may not get all your answers. You will not get the one on one attention you may have hoped for...instead it feels like a ""take it or leave it"" attitude that all the staff from top down seem to take. I did recommend a few friends and family to the clinic hoping for success that I have had atleast with the procedure, but warning them that the treatment from staff from top down will feel a bit off. Their accounts of severe lack of communication, billing irregularities, failing to find anyone to take up their issues to or treat them fairly as a customer, is worse than what i experienced and expected. So i'm very weary about recommending the clinic again.  You will find that the price is often time less than what you may pay at the IVF clinics in other parts of the country for similar procedures. however, you will pay in terms of how little communications and explanations you will the scheduling, nursing staff, and doctors.You will pay in your time, how frustrated their process and their way of conducting business will make you feel. Overall, if you are from the city, well informed and educated about the procedures you are being recommended, know your rights as a patient, know the code of conduct expected of a Clinic like this, and know how to hold parties accountable - then go for it.",2

Do I need IVF yet? No one has even spoken to me.  I was incredibly put off.  After speaking to the doctor - who appeared to have not even looked at my chart- missing vital info like I was on a medication dangerous for trying to conceive- I was told to come in over and over for monitoring.  I did this a few times- never understanding what I was doing or receiving any follow up.  I finally burned out on the awful feeling of not even being a human or having a name to these people and I stopped going.  I was so scared off - it took me almost a year to summon the energy to try to find another clinic and go through it again.  I am so thankful that I did because I found a clinic and doctor who have made the process so much easier by treating me like a human being.  I am currently in my first IVF cycle and wish I wouldn't have waited so long after this awful experience at New Hope.",1

On a few occasions we asked them who we might bring various issues to, so that the process went smoother, and nursing told us that they handled that. The nurses are good at what they do but they are not prepared to handle issues with customer service.The place is very efficient and run like a factory, which is probably how they keep costs down, but also results in very impersonal treatment.After we decided to stop treatment due to a number of failed attempts, we explained that we were going to stop with the doctor involved. It should be noted that we were regularly reminded how poor our odds of success were, and the doctor agreed that stopping made sense.Months later we received an inquiry about our lapse, and when we'd be resuming treatment. We responded that we had informed them we had decided to stop treatment and voiced our issues with the fact that they never seemed to check their records, or simply failed to record it. We received a short statement that we would no longer be communicated with. We replied that we were asking to be acknowledged in some way and treated like individuals but received no further response. It's unfortunate. If New Hope had a couple of people to actually support patients I think it would make a world of difference, but they don't seem to consider that with their current business model. Guess they put more value in saving the money they might invest in customer support. Considering how much they must make, I think this shows a real lack of care in their patients.",2

I cannot imagine I spent my precious two years to do IVF here for many cycles. The doctors are not knowledgeable and I had many failed cycles because they use inappropriate protocols and even cannot do the trigger timing correctly. I have seen many patients with messed up cycles because of doctors' mistakes. Their lab is well-known to be unstable and bad quality. For example, they even let junior embryologist directly do ICSI without going through training. Why? Save cost! You have no idea how your embryos died in their lab. The success of getting blast for embryos can be significantly lower in busier seasons, such as summer. Can you believe that? This clinic just cares to take your money! They don't care about you. Its cost is cheaper compared to other IVF clinic but it is still not worthy it. Save your time and stay away. Don't believe their good success rate on SART!!! It is tricky!

70,70,New Hope Fertility Center,5 star rating,"(I post this on behalf of my friend who wants to remain anonymous) My husband and I planned to have kids right after we got married, but with no success after 3-5 years of trying.  We decided to try reproductive assistance since our insurance also covered this kind of service.  We found a famous doctor in NJ, tried rounds of artificial insemination and 3 IVFs in total, all failed. We had all sorts of tests, results were not bad but not great either.  We were told the prospect looked dismal, and we should think about donor eggs, surrogacy or adoption.  We did try donor eggs, had 20 embryos and transfers, but ended up in miscarriages one after the other.  Along the way 10+ precious years passed.At the time of hopelessness, we came across New Hope and Dr. Zhang. The first thing Dr. Zhang told us was that ""there is no problem with you, tests are all good, all you need to do is to nourish your body and get ready"". The analogy he used was that you need to have a fertile ground first before you implant seeds.  ""I'm confident you will get pregnant within 6-12 months"".Oh, boy, didn't we try hard to ""get ready"" - exercises, diets, emotional balance, herb medicine... After months, we were told we were ready. After 6 months, we had egg retrieval and 4 frozen embryos. I continued physical exercises, jogging, keeping fit and losing weight, for half a year.  When it came to transfer, I insisted on having 2 embryos, though Dr. Zhang suggested only 1 since I was 43 at the time and considered a high-risk case. In the end, lo and behold, I successfully had 2 beautiful babies although the pregnancy process was somewhat eventful with bleeding scares, kidney trouble, and bedridden order. Hey, we made it after all these years of pain and desperation, and we are really proud of ourselves and our 2 kids!In a nutshell, we are very grateful to Dr. Zhang who made our dream come true, and to his conviction of combining Western technology with Chinese cultivation/nourishment methodology.",5

Now that my cycle failed nurses advised that I meet with Dr. Zhang for my next steps. Where was a doc when I needed one? This was my last viable embryo. I wish that I had gotten better care. I feel like the nurses really handled my care this time without consulting with doctors.,2
72,72,New Hope Fertility Center,4 star rating,"Great facility and I have had a good experience with the staff and care in my IVF journey.   I am still in the process of undergoing procedures but I am hopeful.One setback is the anesthesia.  The facility lets patients go home after one hour after IVF sedation.  We do sign a waiver at the end of the procedure stating we are going home alone.  I do understand that many patients do not have someone to take them home, especially since the procedures are scheduled during the day.  But something needs to change as its dangerous and suboptimal in delivery of care.  Maybe provide a chaperone?  Or stress the importance of having someone there to take them home after the procedure.",4

The doctor does not follow your case the nurses are the one sending email saying what the doctor is saying. I started there a year ago with follicle reaching the size of 15 a year later they couldn't detect not one. I feel they don't know what they are doing. You are just a number your care is not customize for you. I was left on the exam table waiting for a doctor to explain to me why a year later i have no follicles. I was left unattended in the exam table. The physician never came when i had an appointment to see her. After 30 minutes i decided to leave because i realized i was forgotten. Hours past no one called me to see if i went to restroom or to see even if I left. "" False hope facility"" seem it will string you along if i didn't come to my senses. In an entire year i saw the doctor 4 times.. run....",1

78,78,New Hope Fertility Center,1 star rating,"Hello again.  We just finished our 4th cycle.  We took a break to mentally prepare ourselves.  In our  4th cycle experience we had to restart our cycle 2 times. Let me explain. We knew we want one doctor to follow our case.  We requested the same doctor after every monitoring.  So we got our instructions for after the first monitoring - expected instructions. We were then ask to take clomid.  After the following monitoring we were told the follicles were gone.  We could not get our doctor to speak to us.  We were told from that monitor to continue to take  birth control pills via email instructions. Where is my doctor?Part two of 4th cycle. We took the birth control pills.  Follicle recruitment as expected.  We asked for our doctor to follow up. The following instructions were to take clomid and gonal.  We didnt want to repeat history.  We were very stern - why are we taking these medications. Asked to speak to the doctor. No good responses.  We purchased the gonal which is expensive.  Results - the follicles were lost.  This was very disappointing as you may expected.  We finally got to speak to our doctor.  He was very nice on the phone and asked us to try again.  Part three of 4th cycle. The end result.  We found out our doctor was not monitoring us like we requested.  The doctor admitted that another doctor looked our case while he was on vacation. That doctor did not know how my wife's reaction to clomid is.  The recommended clomid intake was too high both times and it burned our follicles.  No one came to talk to us till we are ready to our 5th cycle.  The doctors are always busy in the OR.  I only want to think happy thoughts.  NHFC may be working for a lot of couples today.  The doctors are busy in the OR with egg retrieval.  NHFC is not working for us. If you are getting good bad indifferent results, please PM me. If you want to learn more about our experience and what to ask, maybe that conversation will be invaluable to you.  We wish you the best.  We all came here to start a family or grow our family.  In part of that journey, I wish your experience will be a good one.",1

I went with my husband for a consultation in the spring of 2018 and we decided to move forward with our IVF procedure a few months later, in the summer. From our initial visit, we fell in love with Dr. Merhi. He is very attentive to his patients, caring, comforting, personable and has a great sense of humor. My husband and I had some difficulty during our process, as this is not a simple process to go through. Dr. Merhi was amazing through it all! He was extremely attentive, patient and strategic in helping us overcome any hurdles that we encountered. The entire team at NHFC is extremely professional and helpful. The communication at NHFC is awesome as most communication is done through a confidential email system, with respect to scheduling follow up appointments and in providing test results. The staff truly works as a team to address patients. I also love that all their procedures are done in-house, from bloodwork, sonograms, embryo transfers, collecting sperm specimens, etc. The medical facility is well organized and the doctors have a forward thinking mindset in their research and expertise. They are always working to make new breakthroughs to better help patients. I can't emphasize enough how much they are patient-centered and have great bedside manners, which was very important to me. It was a bonus that they have early morning hours, starting at 7 am, and are open 7 days a week. This made it easy to work appointments around my work schedule, and not have to take so much time off. I am happy to report I am 10 weeks pregnant after my 1st embryo transfer. My husband and I couldn't be happier, because Dr. Merhi really took his time with ensuring we had as high of a success rate as possible. He did not rush any component of the procedure, even though it took us a little longer than expected. If we plan on having more children, we definitely know we will return to NHFC, without a doubt. I am sad about not visiting New Hope since I have graduated from their care, but I feel I left with all the knowledge I need to help me through this next phase of my pregnancy.",5

(But nurse who did the ultrasound said i was ovulating). Well they only try to make you spend more money. After a month of trying the Dr suggested the IVF which i didn't want to do Bc i truly believe in the ""old way"" to make babies since i only had PCOS. Well, i didn't listen Dr and now i have a beautiful daughter. I give 2 starts Bc the place is clean and beautiful and the nurses were always super friendly and super kind.

85,85,New Hope Fertility Center,4 star rating,"My thoughts and advice:1. Choosing a doctor is as important as choosing a clinic. I work with Dr. Yang and I think he is the best. All the protocols are personalized and Dr. Yang follows through with his patients from the beginning to the end. Furthermore, he is a very experienced surgeon. He conducts procedure himself for his own patients. I will tell you that many of his patients would rather skip a cycle when he is on vacation.2. Try to use emails when you need a prescription sent or have a billing question. I found phone calls frustrating at times because they are incredibly busy. Also, ask your doctor which method of communication he or she prefers. This will save you from lots of anxiety. Most of my complaints with NH is regarding their nurse communications. If you see an instruction that looks off, communicate with your doctor to make sure dosage or time is right. This is critical prior to retrieval or transfer.3. Try to find a few IVF partners at the wait room. We all need emotional support! 4. Consult your family doctor for a second opinion if you have an abnormal blood result or a test run and a report is available. Another set of eyes always help. Your own wellbeing is as important as a future baby.5. Positive thinking! It's not an easy journey so treat yourself once in a while. Stay happy and stay strong. Good luck!",4

Practice is willing to work with you and even do a retrieval if you only get one egg (which was the case for me on my one and only successful cycle - got one egg, PGS tested, and I'm now 29 weeks pregnant). Other places won't do this and will push you to donor. I worked with Drs. Liu and Merhi. I preferred Dr. Liu as I found him to be more responsive and willing to discuss my questions/concerns. He also acknowledged a mistake made during one of my cycles which had to be cancelled and gave me a free cycle. That went a long way with me in terms of dealing with the emotional disappointment. Cons: Billing department is pretty bad (poor communication skills and no follow up which means you spend a lot of time emailing, calling or going in-person to address mistakes on their end. I had to go in one or twice because phone calls/emails weren't being responded to.) Also, unlike Weill Cornell, you don't have one nurse assigned to you.

96,96,New Hope Fertility Center,1 star rating,"The response you see from New Hope representatives is a perfect example of the misleading practices at this clinic.  There was no consideration of my travel schedule at all.  I made clear my travel dates and they were ignored completely.  No one ever sat down with me and went over a schedule.  None of the information I needed to have a successful cycle was provided.  More importantly - It is a very easy out  to blame women's body's for the clinic's failures.  You see below that this is the ready response to any of their failures.  I was still on birth control when they scheduled the START of my cycle and made my first appointment while I was in London.  This had nothing to do with timing my hormone cycles - they were controlling them with Birth Control.  My cycle hadn't even started yet.  It was pure incompetence, or more likely, general disinterest in the patient's needs, but the response is to blame it on the woman and her body.  If your cycle fails to produce your desired results, they will tell you it is because of your body.  There were failures at EVERY step of my cycle.  So that you can make an informed decision: My experience was not IVF.  I was freezing eggs to extend fertility.  I underwent a similar procedure in another state.  I retrieved 24 eggs with that clinic.  New Hope retrieved only 6.  These are real numbers.  You see the difference in competency.  I was able to produce 14 follicles naturally (with proper stimulation, given my fertility history and hormone panels, I should have been able to produce considerably more with stimulation.  Barring the failure to stimulate properly, at retrieval they only got 6 of those 14 eggs.  The average clinic is able to retrieve (statistical averages) 70 % of the eggs.  This clinic (though they claim extraordinary numbers) was able to retrieve less than half of the eggs I was able to produce.  I have a number of friends who underwent this process at this clinic and their retrieval rates sit at 40 % among them.  All of this excludes the points that can be made about false promises, unethical processes, undue stress.  It is in their interest that you have to do more than one cycle in this process, whether you are extending fertility or undergoing IVF to have a child - economically, they are not incentivized to produce a positive outcome on your first try.  To ask a woman to invest financially, physically, medically, temporally in this process and not take all measures, let alone any measures to ensure the ideal outcome on her behalf is ENTIRELY UNETHICAL.  Women, mothers deserve better.I'm sure many women are hesitant to speak on this experience as it is a personal, private, medical process.  I am not happy to be putting this experience on the internet, but I believe in this process and the importance of a woman's newfound ability to extend her fertility in the face of modern career and family challenges.  This business is founded, run and owned by men.  Some interest in the women's experience and needs in this process is essential.",1

Dr Zhang on first impressions was kind, honest, enthusiastic, very knowledgeable and put us on a less aggressive program than what we had been on... It was exactly the right approach, worked for us and we now we have a 1month old baby boy... It had been a very stressful journey doing IVF but it now ended perfectly at NHFC... We found the surroundings very nice, from the tea and coffee in the reception to all the examination/procedure rooms, it all felt very new and clean and much better than we experienced in the previous clinic... The staff was all very nice and the system works well, it opens early which was good for our work schedule as well as being flexible when needed... My wife is Japanese and I would say the approach and environment does lend itself to an Asian feel, so she felt more comfortable in that respect too... Of the negatives that some people might have, it doesn't give you the most personal of touch and sometimes seems to be mechanical in its operation, but this was never an issue for us personally... for example you spoke to different nurses and doctors along the way, rather than having one dedicated to you... Finally, I felt for the cost side it was also reasonable, the ""softer"" and less aggressive approach was easier on the pocket from a medication point and the capped cost of visits per month meant you wasn't afraid to come in if you were worried or wanted/needed to see a nurse and fear being charged too much... the cost system was very easy without the hidden fears... and this part made us feel more comfortable as we paid out of pocket....Overall I would recommend New Hope to anyone we speak to about IVF in NY....",5

I feel so relaxed when I am there! Enough said... If you are planning IVF, I highly recommend New Hope Facility!",5
111,111,New Hope Fertility Center,5 star rating,My husband and I have been to a number of fertility clinics trying to conceive and finally at the first try at New hope we are expecting our little girl in a couple of weeks.  New hope is a very professional clinic with very respectable nurses and staff.  Out of all the places we've been they are very responsive to questions and provided feedback in a very timely fashion.  I highly recommend Dr. Merhi our doctor who was truly the best as we hit various obstacles. He's very very knowledgeable and assisted with every issue. When my ovarian count was down he put me on certain vitamins and medications that brought it back.  When starting the IVF process when other doctors said that I should cancel my cycle due to lab work he corrected that faulty lab results by tweaking our medications.  While it was a rocky road from beginning to end we finally were blessed with a successful pregnancy.  His compassion and care for what he does makes him in my opinion he best.,5

New Hope has been amazing, all thanks to Dr. Zhang and his wonderful team. The clinic is clean, organized, and as relaxing as a fertility clinic could be. We had done a cycle at another fertility center before moving on to NHFC and there is no comparison! Dr. Zhang introduced me to mini-ivf which involves not as many meds/injections as traditional ivf done at previous clinic. Just one word of advice, they get many clients so it helps to be on top of your own baby ""game"".",5
113,113,New Hope Fertility Center,1 star rating,"I'm still trying to give this place at chance. I've been coming here for 6 months now, and seems like the longer I stay here the more frustration I have with them. For the most part, all the nurses are  very nice and so are the doctors when you actually with them.  There is a lot of lack of communication between patients and the medical staff. When I call in to speak to a nurse, the receptionist will take my name and phone number, and I will get a call back near the end of the day, which in my opinion is not right. A lot of the times when I emailed the nurses, I don't get a response until the next day or if at all, and this is considering that I sent the email before noon. I had my medical records from my obgyn faxed twice and they still claimed that they have not received them. It seems like they don't have a system to properly file faxes as they come in. Apparently there is a file with my name, but according to the nurse ""there is no way for me to go in to find the fax.""The billing department there has annoyed me the most. Since day 1 and including up until last month, 3 different staff members here misinformed about my insurance coverage. It wasn't until I really sat down and read about my coverage that I realized they were wrong. I called them and I brought it to their attention and they agreed I was right. Because of their error, I ended up doing something that I did not need to and therefore wasted a month. Till today, they have not owned up to their mistake and apologized to us. As a matter of fact they have corrected themselves and are making me believe that I was the one who misunderstood them! How could 2 grown up adults(my husband and I) have heard the same thing from 3 different people who now they claimed did not say!!!I feel like they like to bill my insurance for whatever they possible can. They considered a ""3 sentence from a doctor who is talking to me in the hallway outside their sonogram rooms"", this to them is a doctor's consultation!Unfortunately I'm not knowledgeable enough to know if they are messing up with actual important stuff which is the success of the procedure. I am just an obedient patient who does whatever they tell me and hope for the best. But sometimes, when I think about the things that annoy me about them, makes me think about what else could they be messing up with, missing or mishandling. Sometimes I really wonder if my success is their success. The waiting time on the day of a procedure is horrendous. Excuse my ignorance, but I thought that everything is time sensitive, at least that's how they make it feel like, so if my appt for a procedure is at 11 am and I don't get into the room until 2 hours later, Is this normal? One time were sitting in the waiting room for so long that even the receptionist came up to us to ask what are we waiting for.The reason I chose this place is because of Dr. Zhang. But unfortunately I have not seen or heard from the man since my first consultation.This is starting to be a bummer. Maybe, at 6+ months now, if I had news such as I am pregnant, I would ignore all of the above. For now, I m still hopeful and giving them a chance but to be honest I have started looking into other places just to have my options in the future.",1

115,115,New Hope Fertility Center,2 star rating,"One star for the nurses and one for the embryologists, who were the only people at New Hope who would email me back whenever I had a question and who were helpful and pleasant during my visits. If I only had to deal with them, I would give New Hope 5 stars. However, I saw 3 doctors while I was having IVF. Dr. Luk and Dr. Zhang were always in a hurry to get out of the examining room, and were never forthcoming with information. My husband and I felt like we constantly had to ask them for information and hope that we were asking the right questions. We never felt like a priority to them. There was never any follow up after a procedure from the doctors, not even an email. I can understand that if you're a patient used to ""the drill"" that this hand holding may not be necessary. For a first-time IVF-er, though, I expected more walking through each step and explanations throughout the process. After the IVF failed, Dr. Zhang didn't call, not even to encourage me to do a 2nd round. For an event that is so emotional, stressful and costly, I expected to be treated more like a patient and less like cattle.If you do decide to try New Hope, the only doctor I would recommend is Dr. Chang. He saw us a couple times when our regular doctor couldn't and he was what every patient hopes her doctor will be: professional, forthcoming with knowledge, patient and kind. I can't say enough good things about him.",2

119,119,New Hope Fertility Center,5 star rating,Dr Zhang's approach is very different from the rest of the reproductive endocrinologists. And much more gentle and even natural. Yes there can be long wait times. And it can be very busy in there at times. But 100% worth it. I will be forever grateful that I found them. 3 other doctors turned their backs on me.  And now I have a 3 year old daughter because of new hope. Good luck everyone.,5
120,120,New Hope Fertility Center,4 star rating,"We have been going to NHFC on the recommendation of a staff member at our prior clinic in NJ. Yes, someone at another clinic actually told us, ""This place will never help you. Try New Hope in NYC"". So we left our clinic because they refused to retrieve my eggs unless I had at least 3 viable ones. At New Hope, they will work with you to get as far as you can with whatever you have to work with. I started at NHFC in Janary 2015 at 44 years old. I was still ovulating regularly. We had a long consultation with Dr Zhang. He was very honest with us. He told us that we had a 5-10% chance of getting pregnant and then if we did get pregnant, there would be a 45% chance of miscarriage. His honesty was sobering, but we decided to proceed anyway with Mini IVF. The staff over the past year has mainly been excellent. It is factory-like there at times, but super efficient. I didn't mind that they kept their distance a little. I found communicating with the nurses via email the easiest way to get answers to my questions. If I hadn't heard from them in an hour or so, I just emailed them again and got my answer. They're busy. We're all on hormones. Imagine what they deal with there. We had some minor issues with billing, but I am extremely lucky that insurance covered the bulk of my treatment. Maybe this is why I had such a good experience. If you are stressed about money, it definitely does not help you on your journey to becoming a parent. This past January, we transferred the two 3 day embryos we were able to get over the past year. 12 days later, I had a positive pregnancy test. We could not believe it! We had beaten the odds Dr. Zhang initially presented to us! The following weeks were stressful, but my numbers were all good....until our first ultrasound. The baby was measuring small. The US tech was unfortunately not too encouraging but the following week, we had a wonderful tech that told us not to lose hope just yet. On our third ultrasound, the baby had not grown and the heartbeat was slowing. This past Wednesday, I had a D&C at New Hope. The intake nurse hugged me and told me this was the worst part of her Job. Dr. Liu patted my hand before the procedure and told me how sorry he was. These small touches really helped me get through it. I can't say enough about the care I received at New Hope. Even though we are devastated by our loss, we can never say that we weren't well aware of the odds. Having gone through this, I now know that I have done everything I can to try to conceive using my eggs. I know that if I wanted to continue, NHFC would allow me to. I don't think it's fully because of getting paid, I think it's because they allow couples to follow the path they choose. We are now ready to talk about using donor eggs. I considered for a moment changing clinics again since we are out of state, but honestly, why would I leave New Hope? They helped me achieve something I thought would be impossible, even if it didn't result in a baby. This solidified my desire to be a mother, as I was somewhat ambivalent about it before undergoing this whole process. My emotions are running high right now, but I would still, unequivocally, recommend New Hope Fertility Center.",4

No one bothered to mention that they would no longer be a participating provider as of September 1st - 7 days later! It is entirely inconceivable that they didn't know this during my consultation. Moreover, not only did no one in the office bother to mention this upcoming insurance change during my initial consultation, but they never did, despite my arriving and checking-in for three following appointments. In fact, it wasn't until we asked whether a particular procedure was covered that they bothered to mention that my insurance was no longer accepted and we would be stuck with bill. Their billing representative admitted that they should have told us, but still refused to reduce the amount of the bill to what they would've accepted from our insurance company under the circumstances.I don't know if they deliberately lied to us, or were just incompetent (I would hope the latter) but if you're planning to use insurance here - beware!",2

126,126,New Hope Fertility Center,1 star rating,"The care I received from this clinic was quite possibly the worst of my life. While the facilities are clean and modern, the nurses and doctors don't treat people with any humanity. New Hope treats its patients as walking paychecks.Each time that I went for a blood test or sono, there was little human interaction with the nursing staff. You're shuffled from one station to the next like a piece of meat rather than a person. Even when trying to be friendly, I only received terse answers and little kindness. In what is obviously a sensitive and emotional point in your life, you ought to be treated with care and compassion. I never felt that here. From Dr. Zhang especially, there was only routine and coldness. After four months with New Hope, my husband and I were trying to decide on next steps and understand what might be going on. Dr. Zhang actually had his hand on the doorknob as we were asking him questions. I'm sure he's a busy man, but we were paying him for our care, and he was cold and inconsiderate. As we stood trying to get answers to our questions, he opened the door and left the room. I have never been treated so poorly by a medical professional. If you want compassionate, good care, do not go to New Hope. You certainly won't find it here. Try pretty much any other clinic.",1

I completely disagree with reviewers who say that New Hope feels impersonal - no, they have optimized their process so that they can serve all patients fast. But they are professional, quick, and they know what they are doing. Bottom line is that I have been trying to get pregnant for many years before I came to New Hope and I got pregnant and had a healthy baby boy thanks to New Hope.

128,128,New Hope Fertility Center,5 star rating,"Hello All!  I started this review in 2014 and made it a point to complete it today.  I have reviewed New Hope before, but I am here to review it again for the second time, as I have had my second child -- first, by the grace of God and then, by being in the hands of Drs. Zhang and Yang, and, of course, the wonderful staff at New Hope Fertility.  Dr. Zhang is no-nonsense.  He is not going to sit there and commiserate with you about past failures.  What he is going to do is:  1) be honest about your overall situation.  If you are not a good candidate for IVF, he will let you know, but most likely will offer other options of achieving pregnancy; and, 2) he will fully review your history and put you on the best path possible to fulfill your dream of becoming a parent.  When you decide to embark on this journey, you have to be prepared to fail as not everyone gets lucky right away.  After 3 failures, I thought I was doomed.  However, I was compelled to continue and keep trying because I wanted this more than anything.As you read this, you may be thinking that I have a lot of money.  Not the case. My insurance covered nothing. How did I pay for this?  I entirely drained my 401k account. It was a financial sacrifice, but worth every penny.  Today, when I look at my two boys, the thought of a zero balance in that account means absolutely nothing.  For the negative reviews you see here, my advice is this, go to the SART website (sart.org).  This is the reporting organization for assisted reproductive technologies.  Compare Dr. Zhang's results to other clinics -- quite impressive.  Additionally, Dr. Zhang is in Castle Connoly Best Doctors and most important, his lab, embryologists and staff are top-notch.No matter what route you decide to take, I wish everyone who reads my post and who is trying to achieve pregnancy the very best of luck.",5
129,129,New Hope Fertility Center,5 star rating,"First, I would like to thank Dr. Liu ZiTao and his wonderful team at New Hope Fertility Center. I've never thought I would need to seek out to a fertility center, until I start my new family. My husband have had a wish for over 20 years, he currently has one teenage son, over 20 years back he lost his new born baby girl, although he loves his son very much, he still wishes to have a daughter to love. I felt his pain, and in order to not let him live his life with deep regret, we decided to expand our family with a baby girl. But because we are in our middle age, we need help with fertility，we thought becoming pregnant would be a fairly easy process. Before starting IVF, my husband and I looked up many clinics in New York and New Hope appeared to be our best choice. My sister, who's in her 40s got her son with the help of New Hope and her results gave us more courage. However our case didn't happen so easily, we went from frozen to fresh, and we cried each time we failed. Dr. Liu gave us hope and support when we fail. When we got blastocysts, the genetic test results were all boys, we felt so unlucky as is god wasn't giving us what we wanted over and over again. Again we tried, the genetic test results we got back were 46XX PARTIAL ANEUPLOIDY, naturally we got anxious and frustrated, Dr.Liu tried his best to comfort us with his support, he is knowledgeable, friendly, and a grade A professional. With his knowledgeable professional experience our dream finally came true. Yes it was a long journey, but we are happy with the results, thanks to his team's support we were able to get through those tough times. Once again, thank you Dr. Liu and your team!                                                    首先，我要感谢刘子涛医生和他在新希望生育中心的团队。我从没想过我需要去生育中心，直到我组建了新家庭。我的丈夫有一个愿望已经超过20年了，他现在有一个十几岁的儿子，20年前他失去了他的新生女婴，虽然他很爱他的儿子，他仍然希望有一个女儿去爱。我感受到了他的痛苦，为了不让他生活在深深的遗憾中，我们决定生个女儿扩大我们的家庭。但由于我们年过中年，我们需要帮助，我们认为有医生的帮助怀孕是一个相当简单的过程。在开始试管受精之前，我和丈夫搜寻了在纽约的很多诊所，""新希望""似乎是我们最好的选择。我40多岁的妹妹在新希望的帮助下得到了她的儿子，她的结果给了我们更多的勇气。然而我们的情况并不是那么顺利，我们从冷冻到新鲜，每次失败也会抱头痛哭。在我们一无所措时，刘医生给了我们很多支持。当我们有了囊胚，基因测试结果又都是男孩，我们感到很不幸，因为上帝一次又一次没有给我们想要的。当我们再次尝试，得到的基因检测结果是46XX的部分非整倍体，自然我们变得焦虑和沮丧，刘医生尽他最大的努力给予了我们帮助，他知识渊博，友好，超级专业。随着他渊博的专业经验，我们的梦想终于实现了。是的，这是一个漫长的旅程，但我们对结果很满意。感谢他的团队的支持，让我们度过了那些艰难的时刻。再次感谢刘医生和您的团队!",5

I had tried 3 other times previously in another country and didn't get pregnant. I stayed with this clinic beacuse when I met Dr Zhang he honestly suggested me to do NOTHING, to NOT do any ivf or tentative because of my age! this is a very rare answer in these kind of clinics, since they want to make money out of tentatives, while in this case I found pure straightforward honesty. I insisted I wanted to try and the Dr., after explaining my chances were very low around 8%, suggested no invasive treatments, only some pills and just monitor very closely my cycle trying to get the best out of my excpetd only 1 or maximum 2 eggs (at this age they know you won't produce much, so it is common use not to prescribe much medicine). You have to know my husband and I ar both fertile, I mean no problem of fertility, but my husband had vasectomy so the sperm had to be extracted from the testicle (it is done at the uologist they refer, not at the clinic, who, by the way, was an awesome doctor). At th end of hte day, though fertile, I was anyways 43, so ivf was done for both reasons. I think the medical work done was very good and professional and we got a healthy baby. They also suggest to study the embryo befor transfring to the uterus, something also very important and professional, considering at this clinic you don't pay for the entire event, but step by step... meaning, if the transfer doesn't have place they lose that part of th money. All these arangemnts and suggeestions were valuable and I thought well of thm because of them. Now,the thign is not very good at this clnic is communication and organization towards the patient. I even put a complaint while going there, since if you don't ask they don't give esplication...let's say they follow you very accurately but you just have to obey and no many words are spent... if you are , like m, someone that wants to know, understand and decide, ask and insist to see the doctor, since you ar not going to see him much... th internal organization is not very precise, but not in terms of professional and medical outcome, but in terms of communication with the patient. I saw someone wrote they are not sensible to what a woman wants or need, this may seem true, in the sense that theer is no space for emotionality or talking or venitng, it is a little robotic and just straitghforward.. very few words and just obeying instructions.....they should definitely get better in customer care, communication and tact, but  if you understand that and go around that and take the good things, you may be happy and have a good job done on you. They did a very good job with our case and I am sur with everybody, no matter if you get a child or not. As per billling and pricceing, I think they are honest and not expensive, they just charge you per step and thy are honest in avoiding you useless steps if it is not the case, wihtout using sweet words sometimes, just tlling you on the face... but I prefer to be told the truth instaed of being given what I ask for when it is not going to work.

The Center is a large facility that handles many different aspects of fertility; the doctors/nurses are all well-versed pro's at fertility and can probably do many procedures in their sleep on autopilot, but I needed a little more hand-holding and information on what was actually going on. (Another issue is that they were ready to start my process immediately, but I wanted to wait a few more months; this got lost in communication between so many doctors/nurses so there was a stressful confusion of mismatched next-steps between them and me.)

141,141,New Hope Fertility Center,1 star rating,"Horrific experience with this office. They wasted my time with their assembly-line tactics and robbed me of a year of my fertility. After three useless cycles (where they gave me the same 1st line medication that wasn't working), I went to another office which gave me the most advanced combination of three different medicines and I had a successful pregnancy. But it was too late to try for another one after that birth. I had chucked it all to ""that's life"" but to add insult to injury almost 7 years after I last saw Dr. Zhang and demanded a refund (which they gave me) I get a bill in the mail (first time I'd heard from them in all those years) charging me for storage of a bio sample that I never knew they'd kept. I was never told that these would not be destroyed after we terminated our relationship and they refunded our money. They never said I needed to do anything in particular to make sure that they wouldn't keep my biological material. All these years later I feel my privacy violated knowing they have kept this after we fired them. The process for getting our account cleared and our biological material destroyed has been HELL. They refuse to speak to you or communicate directly, rather they send you messages that require login into a special system each time, (you get an email telling you to log in for your message rather than an email with the actual message!) I have been given the run around - asked to send things notarized (which I have done) and still they are not satisfied. I have filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and I'm considering suing them. At this point what they're putting me through is a form of harassment and abuse. I don't understand how people can be so cruel to patients. BEWARE of this place, and if you have the means do yourself a favor and go to a reputable clinic attached to a proper medical center. More than seven years after first finding this place  I'm still regretting ever walking through that door. There weren't public reviews back then so I'm writing this that people are able to make an educated choice. Fertility issues are hard enough.",1

We had gone to several centers and were extremely disappointed.  I knew my body was reacting to the medication and no one listened.  When we finally reached out to Nurse Lisa, whom we had the pleasure to getting help from at another center and she guided us to Dr. Merhi at New Hope. We had also worked with Dr. Merhi previously and he remembered me as soon as I contacted him. From that moment Dr. Merhi spent quality time on my case.  As soon as we enter the center we knew we were at the right place and we literally said we have ""new hope"". Dr. Merhi and the entire staff were so attentive to our needs and listened carefully to every concern we had! They guided us every step of the way.  When ever we had questions we felt comfortable asking.  Dr. Merhi answered all our questions and spent endless time without rushing us.  No other doctor took the time to do this; Dr. Merhi listened when I voiced my concerns of the medications were affecting my body.  He assured me we will figure it out and we did. Nurse Lisa answered all our questions about the medications and always was available when we reached out.  Anyone who has gone through fertility treatments knows that it is a stressful and emotional process.  I never felt as calm as I did at New Hope.  Everyone from the front desk, to the nurse and finance department are so caring and welcoming.  After years of trying at other facilities that treated us as just another experiment, we conceived. We truly believe it was all due to Dr. Merhi, Nurse Lisa and everyone at New Hope! New Hope Center is truly about helping you conceive. None would ever compare to New Hope and the wonderful staff. We will forever be grateful to Dr. Merhi, Nurse Lisa and the entire staff at New Hope!!",5

Dealing with infertility is an intensely draining and bewildering experience.

144,144,New Hope Fertility Center,5 star rating,"I decided to try New Hope (NH) after a friend of mine mentioned about the place. She said she had tried other places and NH was by far the least impersonal, and the most efficient place. In my case, I had tried 4 cycles of conventional IVF in another renown place (RMA), with no success.At NH, yes it is like a factory, but they are so much more efficient (from signing up electronically to communicating via secured email with nurses to getting all your results via email). First of all, their monitoring hours are until 2:00pm, which is a huge relieve if you work. Different from other IVF places where the monitoring hours are usually up until 8 or 9 am.  Second, I felt all the staffs to be warm and cordial. Different from my previous IVF experience where all staff sounds angry and cold. This sounds like a small issue, but when you are in taking hormones and the level of anxiety is high, a nice word or a nice gesture makes a whole difference.  Third, in my case at least, I fell like Dr. Zhang's more natural approach to the hormones intake end up fitting  more my body. Just as an example, he prescribed me 1/3 the amount of hormones and injections I was taking at RMA, and the end result in the first cycle was the same I was getting at RMA. I was able to retrieve 10 eggs, which was the average I retrieved at RMA, but with much less medication. Fourth, the price you pay for the mini cycle is a lot less than the conventional IVF.  If I knew all of these since the beginning, I would never had gone through 4 conventional IVF cycles at RMA. Just to finish my story, Dr. Zhang was very honest with us, he told me that the chances even through IVF was 5 -10 % for my age. We decided to go ahead and in the first cycle, we end up with 10 eggs retrieved and 2 healthy embryos. Dr. Zhang even told me that at my age, to be able to produce two healthy embryos was a very very good result. He suggested implanting one embryo and last month I gave birth to a healthy baby.  I would highly recommend NH if you are looking for a more natural IVF procedure, at a much more affordable prices.",5

One star is to its embryology lab, which is top notch. However, this still doesn't merit going to New Hope if its other aspects are the worst.I don't think a billing department like New Hope's can be any worse. They gave out wrong insurance coverage information and charged us back when my insurance company has denied coverage. It was New Hope's misinformation that misled us thinking our treatment (embryo banking) would be covered. I tried contacting the billing department through emails and calls to discuss the billing issue, and was not called back after 2 months and numerous attempts to reach them. They agreed to review my bill on the call, but then I continue getting bills from them and was then never able to get a hold of them. I then wrote a complaint to Better Business Bureau and even them were not able to get in contact with New Hope. Going to New Hope is my worst decision on my infertility journey. I basically used up my insurance coverage for IVFs because of their misinformation.",1

Epub 2011 Jun 26.)  As the critics say, it seems reasonable to enroll in a trial where they give mini-IVF for free, but there's no reason to pay for possibly ineffective treatment.  Here is the complete text of the abstract that called them out for those false claims.  ""A recent publication in this journal strongly advocated low-intensity IVF (LI-IVF) after presenting the authors' experience with minimal ovarian stimulation (mini-IVF). The data presented failed to support their conclusions. Therefore, presented here is a critique of their manuscript and of uncontrolled clinical use of LI-IVF, in general. In the absence of properly controlled studies, all forms of LI-IVF should be considered experimental and be offered only in well-controlled research settings and with appropriate informed consent.""",1

This was extremely stressful and required quite a bit of energy to resolve. This clinic may not refuse service to people but you have to ask yourself if it's really worth the trouble. Thankfully I hired a fertility coach named Lin Weinberg who helped me find a better clinic amongst helping me increase my egg quality. Contrary to Dr. Zhang, I did not need IVF to have a baby.

149,149,New Hope Fertility Center,2 star rating,"I'm really on the fence about NHFC, after dealing with a new Fertility Center who caught some disturbing numbers in my records. My Hormone levels indicated some issues and my current/new RE is questioning them and wondering why no one - no Doctor at NHFC has brought this up with me and still went through with my first IUI (which was unsuccessful; as was the subsequent). The 2nd issue is that NHFC no longer takes my insurance, so I have been paying out of pocket - and of course it's insanely expensive; exceptionally more expensive than my new center, and if there are hormonal issues, isn't it a moot point to go through with an IUI? Or are you just doing it so you can charge me for it willy nilly?  I really like the staff: nurses, front desk, bloodwork - but in 8 months, I have only seen Dr Zhang once for an initial consultation, and then some random doctors who performed the IUI - in & out (literally - haha) And no followup except via nurses, a quick call, or email. It's not very reassuring, and after spending almost 10k with no feedback, (clearly if IUI isn't working after 3xs and getting no feedback and oddball hormone levels, there's some serious situations falling through the cracks) I don't think I will return here. Their systems are efficient; somewhat cattle call-ish, as they move you through fast and thoroughly, but their lack of personal interaction or empathy and care and individualized attention is disconcerting. I'm a pretty independent, low maintenance, easy going person, and even I feel that there could be alot more individualized attention to patients aside from a ""patient liason"" I observe wandering around sometimes.

165,165,New Hope Fertility Center,5 star rating,"I have had quite a positive experience at New Hope. Perhaps those in charge have become more concerned about their image after receiving some negative reviews, but I am mystified by those negative reviews here. I've experienced the opposite at New Hope: a staff of dedicated Nurses, good med-techs, and YES doctors -- who care MORE & take the time. The entire support staff is the most skilled and most broadly & specifically knowledgeable in the entire fertility process (not just cogs in a wheel) than all of the fertility staff in places I've been to in NYC.  And New Hope is the MOST flexible in every respect, compared to all the other centers. From scheduling retrievals throughout the day, to longer monitoring hours, etc. When I think of the way I was treated by staff (including billing) at NYU, I am amazed how everyone there passed the buck and were so much less engaged than the team at New Hope. ....NYU & CORNELL are FACTORIES.  (Though at least Cornell's billing staff was helpful.)  New Hope intentionally choses staff to minimize IVF patients' stress. I've never had consistently better blood draws than at New Hope. My draws at Cornell & NYU stunk in comparison. Even the sonographers at New Hope seem to me a hundred times more thorough than the actual Doctor Fellows at NYU (who often additionally appear disengaged & perfunctory). One negative reviewer mentioned Dr. Zhang's mentor at NYU. Well, I went to Zhang *after* going to that doctor (he's definitely skilled & the best doc at NYU-FC) & after that guy's institution took nearly six-figures worth of our money -- our savings -- how much of savings does that NYU guy have? Meanwhile that NYU doc gets paid a seven-figure salary from NYU plus doing glamour stints on TV shows, etc. I moved to Dr. Zhang who is far more consultative and tailored in his approach to each patient.  Is Zhang a businessman? Yes. (But the NYU guy can come across as vain and competitive with peers; and perenially one gets the impression he's doing you a big favor to speak with you.) Do Zhang's efforts to develop his own shop negate his far better bedside manner, willingness to listen to patients' preferences & their educated pushback on his recommendations, as well as his (and his team's) far more flexible, bespoke treatment of patients, compared to other shops? No way. The record-keeping at NYU is a JOKE compared to New Hope. They miss the details that would optimize timing and tweaking during each step of the cycle. It's cookie-cutter by comparison. After charging $10,000 just to walk through NYU's door, most everyone at NYU condescends and they're not interested in gathering data to help learn for the next cycle. They might tell you to take a drug (like a trigger shot), but then not even test for it the next day. Or test all your hormone levels each time they monitor. And good luck avoiding Dr. Nicole Noyes on the days when she's in charge. Patients have experienced Dr. Noyes behaving like an absolute MONSTER.   New Hope also treats some of the toughest (oldest) cases. In this respect, perhaps they're giving people False Hope instead of New Hope. But I've personally seen that this office has far more concern about people's wallets than other places. And charges much less for treatment. They're a younger, smaller institution. Good. Personally, I hope they never get too big, because it's the titanic clinics that serve themselves more than patients and can't easily shift their course due to their larger size.

HOWEVER, what will keep me from referring a friend to this clinic is the poor level of customer service you receive from the techs, billing, etc.  It was nearly impossible to get a call back from the nurses when I had timely questions regarding medication days before a procedure (which actually came close to ruining one of my retrievals).  When you visit the office never expect to leave within an hour and a half.  On billing, I have literally left 15 messages and multiple emails regarding charges that I wanted more color on over the the last two months to no response which I find just unacceptable.  My sense is their patient count and overall program awareness has grown faster than they can keep up with and they don't have the appropriate staff in place to properly manage the inflows.  For the premium they charge to their peers, I would have expected superior customer service- what received was subpar.",3

171,171,New Hope Fertility Center,3 star rating,"I have done 2 iui's at nh on my way to do ivf - all with donor sperm. Pros - They are less money than other places. Their hours of monitoring and insemination are longer which considering average life of donor sperm is about 12 hours, if you're ovulating at midnight, you could do your insemination at 1pm - but they won't tell you this, you have to find out and ask when you think you're ovulating and work backwards and come in at 1pm on your own. Pro and Con -they do a lot of monitoring which is good for precision, but after one iui and having my baseline, I didn't feel the need to come back on day 3, 8, 11. . . for insemination like they wanted, I came on day 11 and went from there. Staff is friendly but you have to hunt them down. No one tells you anything and email responses are spotty depending on what you are asking. I was at RMA and the nurses sat down with me and told me everything, answered all of my questions and the doctor at RMA was available.  Here, the doctor is hardly ever available albeit knowledgeable. The embryology dept. is very helpful and responsive.  Have all of your questions when you come and grab the nurses then and maybe, possibly, you might have a minute with the doctor or they can check with the doctor and get back to you.  Don't rely on the front desk staff to get important info across (although they are nice).  Tell the nurse.  Do diligent research about mini ivf vs. standard depending on your age and issue - don't just rely on them to tell you as there is conflicting reports about this out there.  I hope this info helps.",3

Today, I am grateful I ended up at NYU Fertility Center in the year 2000 with the best Doctor ever: Dr. Licciardi (I just saw on their website he is still there and I know he is a great asset to NYU Fertility Center). I also remember a very caring and nice nurse, I am not sure I am spelling her name properly: Nurse Oana (I think she was from Romania or an Eastern European country, not sure) anyway, all the nurses were very supportive during this emotional journey. They have a great team and I have to thank them for having given me the most precious gift I have: my daughter. Life Is full of surprises as now 19 years after, my daughter is a freshman at NYU!",5
174,174,NYU Langone Fertility Center,4 star rating,"I decided on NYU after doing a lot of research on egg freezing. I had an excellent experience, but I can see why some people may have complaints. Here are a few points to consider:First, it is a factory but an organized one. Actually, it gave me comfort to know that the center is a well oiled machine.  You may see the same nurses during blood work, but often they are different. They were all excellent. Get there at 7 am to avoid the wait for blood work. Second, no one is going to hold your hand during the process. I felt completely unprepared when it was time to do my first injection. I read the directions and then watched the videos. It probably took me an hour to do my first two injections. I was cursing the center's name during my first injection as I felt that they could have done more to prepare me. Fast forward to Day 4, I was a pro at administering the injections (less than 10 minutes). Third, your doctor may not do the actual retrieval. Dr. Licciardi was my doctor but I saw him only twice during the process. We met at the consult and then he preformed one ultrasound. I was surprised when I learned he wasn't the one conducting my retrieval but he called me and put me at ease about who was doing the retrieval. All of the doctors are highly skilled with decades of experience so you will always be in great hands. I really thought Dr. Licciardi's care was excellent during the process. He was always accessible by phone and email, and he called me several times to keep me updated and to check on me. I definitely felt that he cared and I wasn't just another number in the factory.Fourth, you will get excellent results. I think Dr. Licciardi wanted to manage my expectations because he told me to expect 10-14 eggs, but 22 were retrieved and 20 mature eggs were frozen (age 36). What this actually means I really don't know because Dr. Licciardi made it clear that there are no guarantees. Egg quality is a mystery until you make embryos. Fifth, it's expensive. You have to go into this knowing that you are going to drop thousands of dollars. My insurer was giving me the runaround and I couldn't wait any longer. I slashed my living expenses where I could (i.e, got a roommate). I initially was going to go to a less expensive center and then I thought is this really the time for me to be frugal??? These are your future children. You owe it to your future self to go to the best provider. Sixth, be realistic. I'm going to do another cycle because more eggs = higher percentage of a positive outcome. I'm doing this knowing that I have no control over the future outcome. I have to be okay with the thought that nothing is guaranteed. Do your research and be proactive, but love yourself no matter what happens. What is meant to be will be.",4

176,176,NYU Langone Fertility Center,4 star rating,"I had my first cycle out of the two covered by insurance done at another practice, which proved to be a waste of time and money. Disappointed in those results, I researched other practices and doctors in NYC to try to have better results for my last cycle covered by insurance. Based on my extensive research, I learned that Dr. Grifo is one of the most prominent IVF experts in the country and that he has had personal experience with IVF in his own family.I am happy to say that I had a good experience with Dr. Grifo at NYU and much better results than at another clinic (which I also reviewed). One of the most important things to look for is that the doctor studies your charts after each test and adjusts the medication and protocol accordingly to maximize your chances for a positive outcome. Dr. Grifo does exactly that. He seems to know exactly what to do in more difficult situations like mine where the body doesn't react to the medicine quickly. Other clinics often make you follow a generic protocol and shrug when you don't get results even though they should know that every body reacts differently to the medicine. In the end, I had much better results than the first time at another clinic due to the above attention to detail and correct adjustments to the meds made along the way. The biggest issue with this facility is cost. They seem to make up prices out of thin air. For example, they charge $1,000/year for storage when many other places charge $350-600/year. And they ask for $500 to give you your own eggs if you decide to transfer them elsewhere. Most places charge $0-35 for this, which literally involves just pulling your vials from storage. Be aware!I also encountered issues with NYU's and specifically the anesthesiology department's billing practices. They require payment up front even when your services are fully covered by insurance. In my case, they charged me their cash rate and it took me 4 months and hours of my time to get them to refund the overcharge (the difference between the cash rate and the insurance-negotiated rate that I should have paid).",4

178,178,NYU Langone Fertility Center,2 star rating,"Genetic counselor, Andria was the only bright spot at this clinic (have been to 3 clinics at this point). She was responsive, knowledgeable and easy to work with. She was prepared for our session, explained our options clearly, and was able to order the necessary tests to help us build our probe (that we eventually used for a successful pregnancy via IVF).Medical care was not satisfactory. Did 3 letrozole cycles here, and had to ask after every failure to up my dosage (started at 2.5, then went to 5, and then 7.5). Don't seem like a Doc even reviewed my cycle records until I asked. Found out after the fact only a tiny 5 ft, 100 lb woman should be on a 2.5 dosage. Also did a saline sonogram here, and there were literally chunks of my cervix on the floor after because it took the Doc FOUR tries to get the speculum and catheter in properly. Please note, it has never taken another Doc more than 1 try.Administrative support here was probably the worst part of this clinic. Was frustrating to schedule appointments and get questions answered by the nurses. Every phone/email interaction took no less than THREE tries. When we decided to go somewhere else for IVF, it took over a MONTH to get the medical records. They kept saying they were sent via mail, but after me calling every week for over a month the admin realized the folder had been sitting on a desk but never picked up. When it got sent to me, more than half of the records were missing, but luckily the few items I needed where there.",2

The morning visits were smooth and calm.  The surgical procedure itself was a breeze. It was my first time going under anesthesia, and I was terrified--but the whole thing ended up being just as efficient as the rest of my care at NYU.  I am now one day post-op and have no pain at all.Would recommend, would do again, and will definitely go to NYU for any future fertility care I may need in the future.",5
180,180,NYU Langone Fertility Center,4 star rating,"Experience at NYU Fertility Center in May 2018; I was 35.1. Initial consult w/ Dr. Noyes.  She was good at making me feel comfortable with the process. She also smartly rejected my initial low AMH results (.7) noting birth control pills sometimes affect them; AMH bumped to 1.88 after I stopped bc for 2 months.2. Meet patient coordinator:  She was supposed to be my main point of contact over the next few weeks, though after paperwork/insurance was handled, I never spoke with her again.3 Orientation:  This provided useful information on how everything would proceed.  I recommend bringing your SO (if you have one) so that you can do your paperwork together under supervision.  4. Process begins!  You show up for monitoring (blood draw + ultrasound) on day 2 of your period.  Monitoring is something you'll be doing a lot of; it's quick (~20 min), and then you are on your way (maybe leading to the factory feel that some have reported, but I liked the expediency).About monitoring:  I felt like the nurses were great, caring and competent.  The ultrasound was always done by a doctor (though not always *your* doctor).  Monitoring also makes you feel like you're in a spy movie; every day you are told to ""await a phone call with further instructions.""  Later, the call comes with info about how much medication to take.  On my protocol I was on maximum Menopur (450 per day). I started taking ganirelix to prevent ovulation around day 6. 5. About the shots:  Mixing Menopur takes a lot more time than expected!  Prepare to spend ~20 min each night setting everything up and take extra precautions to ensure you are doing it right.  No reason to mess up your cycle because you forgot a vial or took the wrong meds. Also, I strongly recommend icing to help make the shots more bearable.  Personally I didn't feel much the first 5 days of stims. By the time they had me on ganirelix I did feel twinges in my abdomen and felt bloated. 6. Extraction.  When they determine you are ready, they'll tell you a specific time to take your trigger shot; your procedure will be 35 hrs later. When you get there, it's a quick review of your medical history before setting you up on a surgical chair (w/ very high stirrups). Note - the retrieval doctor is unlikely to be *your* doctor (from the consult); fine by me, but some people may not realize this going in.7. Recovery: Once you have demonstrated your vitals are ok and you can use the bathroom on your own they send you out with a few docs about what to do/not to do and look for over the next week. You are also told your egg count (mine was 12).  For me, recovery wasn't bad. I did not accept Tylenol and felt like I had very bad cramps for the rest of the day but they improved by day 2. Overall, I was lucky not to have significant side effects from any part of the process or procedure. I suspect that this is the norm and so want to emphasize it since most boards are filled with negative experiences.8. Before starting I wish I knew: (a) you can't exercise during the protocol OR for another 10-14 days afterwards! (b) The process is a big deal. To be realistic about it: shooting yourself with hormones every day is grueling. 9. Results:  I ended up w/12 eggs; 11 fertilized, 7 became embryos & 3 were viable. I would have been pleased with this, except that they needed to use ICSI for fertilization.  Apparently, my husband's sperm (which he provided a few weeks earlier and looked 'great' at the time) - did not come out of frozen in a good state.  I was *extremely* frustrated by this and consider it a huge fault of NYU that they did not inform us of this possibility (there was ample time for my husband to come back to provide more specimens).  Instead, we ended up spending a LOT of money on ICSI, and also being concerned /frustrated that we had to choose among a poor sperm sample.10. Overall I would consider the experience generally positive due to the quality of people at NYU and feeling in safe hands.  That was the most important part for me.  On the negative side: the front office is extremely disorganized (don't discount other reviews about this; be vigilant about your paperwork and double check everything!).  Also - I was extremely disappointed that NYU did not recommend we provide multiple sperm samples, which led us to need ICSI.11. Recommendations for NYU:  I think the biggest issue for NYU in terms of 'feel' is the lack of a single point of contact for your cycle.  I assumed the patient coordinator would be that, but I didn't interact with her again once I started my cycle.  If they could somehow ensure a single, constant person greeted you each day for monitoring and later called you with instructions, it might feel a bit more personalized.  I also think a call at least once during the cycle from the doctor of your initial consult would help immensely to improve 'feel.' However - my main goal was to go through this process in safe hands and I felt that was the case with NYU.",4
181,181,NYU Langone Fertility Center,1 star rating,This place will force you basically to use donor eggs if you are above age 40. No effort to try anything. Just see that you are above 40 and tell you that your only hope is to use donor eggs. I would advise anyone above 40 (women) NOT to pursue treatment here.

Examples: Few of them have email address (at least that they will provide). Many of the rest don't even have direct phone numbers - so it is sort of a ridiculous joke trying to reach people at various critical stages.  People who are ""coordinating"" things say things like, ""Did you tell so and so?"" And you're thinking ""I emailed every person with an email address, am I supposed to personally call every person whose name I've ever heard at NYU until I reach them after going through the switchboard? Isn't that, perhaps, your job? They are, of course, totally on top of billing - that part is always very clear and taken care of first and foremost.  So, it's pretty clear what they really care about.I've heard bad things about Cornell (and nothing positive), so I wouldn't recommend them either.  Maybe try CCRM?  Or get out of New York if you can. I think it's hard to find someone in New York who doesn't just care about the money and know there will also be lots of patients in the pipeline, even if they get some bad reviews.[They also misrepresented the number of eggs they froze AND the number of embryos I produced (presumably so it my results would look/sound better) - luckily I switched facilities and my new Dr. straightened this out.  I was annoyed when I realized this, but I can't say I was surprised.]",2

Look instead at the most recent literature from the medical community and to sources you can trust for expert and accurate advice.

186,186,NYU Langone Fertility Center,5 star rating,"I have undergone three egg retrieval cycles here. One word of caution to people planning to freeze their eggs for future use:  it's fairly common to get between 5 and 10 eggs per retrieval, some percentage of which may not be mature enough to freeze. (They do freeze the immature eggs, but at the moment, there is no way to get a human egg to mature outside of the ovary. Research is ongoing, so they freeze the immature eggs in hopes that fertility science has had some breakthroughs by the time the eggs are thawed for use.) The trouble with egg freezing is that people should probably have ~20 eggs banked if they donate at age 36-37 and want a 50% chance at a live birth. Still, it's important to keep in mind that this process is basically a scientific miracle. Having a child genetically related to oneself following cancer or into one's 40s is a triumph of technology over the harsher side of nature.Dr. Grifo is my phenomenal doctor who came highly recommended and has lived up to his word-of-mouth. I am impressed with his intellect and dedication to continuing research in fertility. This guy does not quit. He is exactly who you want on your make-a-baby team. He knows these processes so well that after a cycle or two, he masterfully tailors the drugs to what the individual patient can tolerate. My retrievals consistently went up under his careful monitoring and I didn't even do the acupuncture or yoga. (Seriously, who has time for all these appointments, having a professional job to pay for this, plus time for yoga classes and acupuncture?).Dr. Noyes is also freaking amazing. I read on here that maybe she isn't always warm and fuzzy. Number 1: Who cares!? She is a scientist and surgeon, not a therapist. Number two: she has had a great sense of humor, a jovial, approachable manner, and a clear underlying focus on results whenever I've interacted with her. I was laughing and talking about gelato as I waited for the anesthesia to kick in. Then I had an effortless, painless recovery. Dr. Noyes is rigorous, meticulous, courageously honest about what patients can expect and should do, and dedicated to high performance standards. Note:  Dr. Noyes is the most statistically oriented of the doctors with whom I've interacted. If you are a logical, statistical thinker, you will get sick of all the anecdotal and narrative evidence batted around in fertility forums and between moms. Dr. Noyes will cut through that insidious optimism and help you make statistically informed decisions. Demand this. I also highly recommend Dr. Fino - another experienced straight shooter who will not BS you about what to expect. And if you have Dr. Grifo, definitely let him do whatever he thinks best with your drug protocol. He's got the art side of this process down.As for having a whole team of doctors available:  this is so much better than going back to the same person over and over again. The way this clinic is set this up, patients have access to second, third, and fourth opinions during their cycles. Empower yourselves and use the team of doctors to your advantage. Way better than reading fertility forums which tend to be overly optimistic.",5

This was a great resource for me, straight from the New York Department of Health: health.ny.gov/publicatio…I was on track to move forward with this procedure but ultimately decided not to do it at NYU.One of the nurses (there are three) was troubled by my questions related to potential medical risks for donors, and expressed this. This is when I myself started to get concerned. Although this procedure is elective, donors should be entitled to understand potential medical complications. There are medical risks associated with egg donation, and donors should go through the procedure fully informed of those risks. I do not feel confident that the health of donors is given enough consideration at NYU - there are other options in the city. Consider where you go carefully - your health matters, too.",1

I haven't yet received bills for the other three visits and sets of blood work. I'll update as those bills come in.)I contacted our health plan's fertility nurse when my husband & I decided to conceive. She suggested because of irregular cycles I go straight to a fertility center for testing and potential medication. I found out I was pregnant a couple days before my appointment at NYU. It was too late to cancel without financial penalty, so I went anyway. They care for pregnancies up to 10 weeks, so I figured I'd stick with them in case of miscarriage.1/3 - First appointment, chatted with Dr. Noyes, had a blood draw to confirm pregnancy. They took blood for genetic carrier screening and many other things they didn't tell me about beforehand. I wish they'd told me which tests they were running, since many were repeats of tests I'd had done recently and have records for. The nurse called me same-day with my hCG level and said to come back in 2 days for a repeat to confirm my levels were doubling. 1/5 - Went back, had the blood draw, got a call same-day to say that my hCG had doubled and my pregnancy was progressing well. They told me to come back the following week for another blood draw. I was confused because I'd initially been told I'd just need the first and 48-hour tests, but the nurse said it was necessary to confirm things were moving successfully. 1/10 - Went back for another draw, got a call same-day from a nurse. She said I had to return in a week for an ultrasound, although it would be too early to see a heartbeat, and I'd need another ultrasound the next week to look for a heartbeat. (There are studies about behavioral problems in chicks and rats exposed to ultrasound in utero, so I'm trying to limit ultrasounds.) I said I'd prefer to wait until I was far enough to find a heartbeat, so I could just have one ultrasound instead of two. She balked and said it was essential I do the early ultrasound because my blood test numbers had been low and there was concern about my pregnancy being viable. She said my progesterone from the 1/3 and 1/5 tests was too low. This was the first I'd heard of this. I asked her for my progesterone results from today's blood tests, and she said it wasn't taken. She said they didn't check because Dr. Noyes ""doesn't believe in supplementing with progesterone"" to prevent miscarriage. (Ok, so why am I here going through all these blood tests if we're not going to actually do anything? Progesterone supplementation is controversial, but it would have been nice to at least have been given the chance to discuss with my doctor.)1/20 - Had a blood draw and transvaginal ultrasound. The nurse didn't wash her hands or use gloves to prep the ultrasound probe (and she touched door knobs and a trash can). I asked her to re-do it in a sanitary way, as I've developed infections from ultrasounds previously. The doctor who performed the ultrasound was kind, said everything was normal, and we got to take pictures and a video of our baby's heartbeat. She said we still needed a repeat ultrasound in a week, but didn't clarify why.1/22 - Called to get my test results from 1/20. The nurse said my blood from 1/20 wasn't run since the doctor saw what she needed on the ultrasound. I wish they'd waited until after the ultrasound, so I could have avoided an unnecessary blood draw and bruised arm. The nurse gave me the results from an earlier blood test that I hadn't received before. She said I was not immune to chicken pox, measles, or rubella. (Idk how this is possible because I caught chickenpox and had two MMR vaccines. My titers were checked a few years ago when I volunteered in a hospital and came back showing immunity.) But anyway, the nurse said I needed to get the MMR and varicella vaccines ASAP and wait 30 days to get pregnant. (Those are LIVE vaccines which are NOT given during pregnancy!)Nurse: ""You need to go to a clinic to get the MMR and chickenpox vaccines. Just wait 30 days to get pregnant.""Me: ""Ok, so I guess I should have this baby and get the vaccines right after and then I won't be getting pregnant within 30 days?""Nurse: ""Well you need to get the vaccine before you get pregnant, so you don't want to wait.""Me: ""Ok well it's too late for that now, and I can't get the vaccines because I'm pregnant.""Nurse: ""If you're not going to follow our advice to get the vaccine, you'll need to sign a waiver saying you understand the risks.""Me: ""But I'm 6 weeks pregnant so what am I supposed to do?""Nurse: ""It's up to you.""I later emailed Dr. Noyes (she didn't respond) and called the office to clarify. The same nurse (I think) said that nurses don't look at patients' records when they call with test results.

These bills make NO sense, because NYU will not even give you treatment at the Fertility Center unless you pay EVERY CENT up front. The invoices are jibberish, but they keep sending them to us. Every time we receive a bill it is like PTSD about our past failed cycles. And when we contact the billing center to discuss (more than 10 times at this point), they claim there is some secret ""Accounts Receivable"" person who makes all the decisions who we are not allowed to talk to directly. Why not?! So bizarre. NYU Fertility Center is inhumane and really unpleasant to deal with. Avoid at all costs.",1

191,191,NYU Langone Fertility Center,4 star rating,"My experience with Yelp reviews is that they are mostly either excellent or disastrous, and so I am writing to give a more nuanced picture. I froze my eggs with NYU in 2012 and it was totally fine. It was well organized and although there are a lot of people handling you and your visits, I felt they were competent and everything was done professionally. I only met with Dr. Noyes once during the process. There was a training session to explain the egg freezing process and ask questions, as all the language around different hormones and cycles can be overwhelming. The most difficult part of the process is the first time you come home with all the prescriptions and needles and you have to inject yourself for the first time. I had a friend help me with this process, but the Center should be able to provide more training and support at this point. My egg freezing procedure was successful and was seamless. I recommended a friend to the Center who had a similar experience. I now pay an annual $ 1000 fee to keep my eggs frozen, and I have been told by friends that can transfer them to other services at a cost of $ 1500 for 5 years.",4
192,192,NYU Langone Fertility Center,3 star rating,"I think the doctors are top-notch here and they are worth coming here for, but the support staff needs reorganization.The nurses are good at responding to voicemails, but their response is always to tell you to speak with billing.  Their default start of conversation is always to ask ""did you speak with billing?""  I've learned that if you press them, sometimes they will actually  look in your chart and see that there really is no need to speak with billing.And I've found that billing only returns calls about 1 out of 4 times.  Several months ago, I was told that I had to speak with a particular person at billing before I had a procedure.  I left message after message.  When I spoke to others at the office, they kept telling me to call her.  She finally called me back over a week later and told me she had been on vacation - apparently no one was covering for her and no one knew she was on vacation.  In the meantime, after speaking with someone below her at the office, I called insurance myself and relayed all the info - Insurance told me to go ahead with the procedure.  When the woman from NYU returned from vacation and returned my call, she became upset with me because I had spoken to someone else in her department in billing!  It was really quite odd. But, If I had waited, I would have missed that month's window.  As a patient, I've continued to experience this type of disorganization with each cycle.  I've at various times waited two hours to be seen during morning monitoring - and double checked to see if my name had been called - have been told no, it hadn't, and then upon seeing the nurse, have been told that i was called earlier. Unfortunately, it seems that the staff does not communicate very well. Others I've spoken with have also experienced it.   It's very stressful.Also - I would skip the Recombine Genetic testing that they recommend here.  I was previously tested at another place and that should have been enough.  I was told that Recombine would accept my insurance - and my insurance did pay them over $1500 for the carrier map testing, but yet I still received a bill from Recombine for over 4 hundreds dollars.  (Even though they only charge people without insurance $345). When i called Recombine, they told me they could reduce the payment, but refused to issue a new bill for me stating this.  I felt like i was being jerked around.Despite this, I think my doctor is great.  Just wish the rest of the experience was more pleasant and straight forward.",3
193,193,NYU Langone Fertility Center,1 star rating,"I agree with the others regarding doctors/nurses not giving much attention to you or your future. 1) You feel like you are in a vacuum. Dr. Berkeley will talk to you on the first day (and that's it), and after that, you will most likely only communicate with either nurses, coordinators, billing department, more nurses, and a 'day of' doctor. But since they don't talk to each other, you are always told different story. e.g. payment plan, timing, your chart and what's missing, etc. 2) My husband called 2 weeks prior (and I also wrote them an email) to confirm his appointment for providing his semen, and sure enough, they didn't have his name for that day. They in the end explained how the lab was not ready that day, and they didn't know till that morning. All of that, it took them 45 minutes to figure out, and after he was told numerous times that he did not have an appointment. 3) I was told that I could adjust the timing of my transfer with pills. When I reached out to one of the coordinators to book the transfer date and/or to get the prescription for the pill, she said there is nothing she can do until we have the PGS result. But, when I got the PGS result, I then was told (by a different nurse) that it was too late to take the pill now as I should have taken in on day 2 of the previous month. 4) They told me that I need to book an appointment with Dr. Berkley to complain about all of the above. But, they don't realize that the phone tag play is pretty awful. I guarantee that they will not pick up your call (no matter which number you call), and you leave a vm, and if you ever miss their callback, good luck because when you call back, that will go to vm again.",1

199,199,NYU Langone Fertility Center,4 star rating,"I did one egg freeze cycle here and my review is based on that.  (This is a long review, but I wanted to describe the whole experience.)  Overall, I thought NYU was efficient and professional, and I'm very pleased with my experience.  I'll briefly describe the steps of their egg freezing cycle:  first, you go in for bloodwork on day 2/3.  Then you do an initial consultation with the doctor you chose.  In this consultation, he/she first reviews your medical history and talks you through it, and also provides a detailed overview of the process, and statistical chances of success.  Then, he/she does an examination to make sure everything looks in order down there.  After that, you sign up for one of their egg freeze ""orientations,"" which is a 2-3 hour presentation by a nurse about the details of the process (this was probably the weakest link in the experience, more on that below.)  After that, you're ready to start whenever you're ready.  (I ended up waiting a year, but didn't have to redo the consult.)  You pick a pharmacy (I highly recommend Apthorp -- they deliver!), and NYU will call in your prescriptions.  (They also will check your insurance for you to see if any of the medications are covered.)  I opted to order in small doses as needed since I didn't know what my protocol was going to be or how long I would be on stims.  This was no issue as Apthorp will deliver same day, even when you call late afternoon.  You go in for bloodwork on your day 2, and then that afternoon, if you're bloodwork is solid, you're cleared to start meds and they'll tell you exactly what to take and when, and when to come back into the office.  (It's usually in 1-2 days, always in the mornings between 7-9 am).  Every morning you go in, they do bloodwork, and most often they will do an ultrasound also to check how you are responding to the stims.  Then, that afternoon, a nurse will call you, give you your estrogen levels, and give you instructions on what to take for then next few days and when to come back.  Once the doctor doing your ultrasound deems you ""ready,"" they'll schedule your retrieval procedure, usually two days later, and instruct you to take a trigger shot.  The nurse will call and tell you precisely when to take the trigger shot, as your procedure in the OR will be timed exactly to this time.  The day of the retrieval, plan to spend 3 hours at the place -- an hour to change/talk to the anesthesiologist/wait around, 10-15 minutes for the procedure, and about 45 mins to an hour of recovery, where they give you water and crackers, and maybe pain meds if you need them for cramps.  Before you leave, you get your egg count.  This is the amount extracted.  The next day, a nurse calls you and tells you how many of those were able to be freezed, and of those, how many are mature.  Overall, I was very pleased with the experience.  My doctor was Dr. Liccardi, who was very nice and knowledgable, and called me the day I started stims to make sure I was ok.  It's true that you don't see the doctor much, if at all, after your initial consult, but I really did not mind as every doctor I saw (they rotate in the mornings to do the ultrasounds) was very competent and nice and I never felt that I was not in good hands.  In the mornings when I went in, I would usually arrive around 8 am, and I rarely had to wait more than 5-10 minutes.  And the whole thing would take no more than 20/25 mins if we did an ultrasound, and 5-10 if it was bloodwork only.  There is definitely a ""factory"" feel to the process, and sometimes you feel guilty holding up the process by asking questions (they just move that fast), but I actually overall appreciated that quality, because it made the entire experience very efficient and not much of an intrusion into my daily routine.  If you have questions in the process, you call the nurse's hotline and someone will call you back within 2-3 hours.  I did at times wish I had a direct line to someone, but I realize they are busy treating patients and not sitting by the phone.  In terms of areas for improvement, my only complaint would be the orientation process. I thought it was long and drawn out and filled with a lot of useless info (e.g., diagram of the female reproductive system), with the most relevant info (dos and don'ts) kind of mixed in easy to forget.  Also, the nurse that did our orientation (both times -- I attended twice since I waited so long) was a bit strange and I thought somewhat inappropriate, but most importantly, long-winded and slow, making it an unhelpful 3 hours of my workday.  I think the orientation should be shortened by half with the emphasis on 1) do's and don't's during the cycle; and 2) a quick demonstration of how to administer the shots (not an endless one, as I experienced, since there are videos online.)  But overall, I'm extremely pleased with my experience and highly recommend NYU to anyone considering an egg freeze cycle.",4

I had repeated failed cycles here, and questioned their earlier representations to me. But, more so, their billing felt incredibly disorganized. I came in for my retrieval and they said they wouldn't do my retrieval unless I on-the-spot paid them $5k. I was perplexed because days earlier I didn't have a balance at all and confirmed that my insurance still had not reached its cap for fertility treatments. They were beyond rude and horrendous to me. I found Dr. Grifo's behavior to be unprofessional and beneath the standards I would expect for a physician - despite the fact that he delayed my procedure due to their on-the-spot demands for money - he had the gall and distaste to say to me that he could have made $3,000 during the time he was speaking to me. I have never experienced a more callous, money-hungry experience as a patient and would never return to this clinic again.

201,201,NYU Langone Fertility Center,3 star rating,"I am surprised to see so few reviews here of this clinic.  I will add my two cents and will try to be as fair and intelligent as possible in my thoughts, because, if you are reading this, you are contemplating some big stuff in your life!Disclaimer: my partner and I did this electively - we froze our embryos - and we are not trying to conceive at this time.   So I might have had higher expectations for this place, having not been in a situation where I felt that I had no other options.I totally agree with the previous reviewer (G.B.) in her two main points: 1)  If you want results, you are as likely to get them here as anywhere else2)  They are NOT into giving ""more emotional type support to their clients"".  Amen, sister!  You are so right on that.We had Dr. Keefe, and he is awesome.  One of the best doctors I've ever worked with.  He made an immediate connection with us and I really value that.  I can say that Dr. Grifo is awesome, too, because I had some contact with him also.  But unfortunately, you spend very little of your time here with your doc.  You will be making regular visits, and it is the rest of the staff that you will be working with, and you will be super hormone'd up and extra sensitive, to boot.  I had a few bad experiences with the staff, especially this super mean lady in the recovery room, OF ALL PLACES (when you are waking up from the anesthesia, from your procedure)  -- dang!  She was just super gruff and mean, and at one point just walked away while I was sitting alone and crying, during my intake for the procedure, when I was anxious and scared.  Ugh.  If I had once piece of feedback for this place, it would be to please only hire people with a decent bedside manner, especially those who work directly with patients.  Sometimes it felt like they were taking the ""care"" out of medical care.  Also, you feel a little bit like cattle, going through the process.  I wanted to tattoo my name and date of birth on my forehead, from getting asked so many times.  My other negative is that they really just don't prepare you for the enormity of what you are going through.  I would read up on IVF, the hormones, the injections you give yourself, the pain and discomfort that you will experience, and the procedure, before you proceed.  They really don't provide the support for the emotions that you will experience, or even the physical pain, so you have to find this support elsewhere.  (I suggest hooking up with someone who has been through it before and putting them on speed-dial on your phone).   When I think about it, this is crazy to me, because, by all accounts, stress and anxiety are really bad for fertility, but they don't seem to give a crap about any stress or anxiety you are feeling.  Nobody will ever simply ask you how you are feeling.  They're not about that.The good stuff is: they know what they are doing, and I believe they are actually one of the clinics who helped make this whole field in the first place.  I overheard a couple other ladies questioning their medicine doses and the timing of their procedures, and I just would caution against going down that road.  I think it will make you crazy to second-guess the doctors here, but hey, hormones make you do crazy things!  Anything having to do with making babies is an inexact science, that's just the way it is.  But I believe that this place has the most data, the most information, to base their decisions on.  It is also an emerging and changing field.  There may be students in some of your appointments.  (I'm all for it because it will help future couples conceive, but if you don't want a student in there, just speak up and say so.)Another ""good"" thing, if you can call it that, is that the injections that you give yourself - that you will dread - are really no bigs!  You can just watch the training videos a bunch of times til you feel comfortable doing it (that's what I did).  Needles have come a LONG way.  They are tiny now.  Try not to over-worry this part.The other ""good"" thing, if you can call it that, is that the procedure, which I spent a lot of time dreading, it no bigs either.  They put you in what they call, and I am not kidding, ""twilight sedation"", which is great.  The anesthesiologist stays with you the whole time.  The sedation is awesome.  It is all the stuff Michael Jackson was into :)  My recovery was also no bigs at all - can't say that I had any issues with that.So, the bottom line for me is: this is a results-oriented medical clinic that will not hold your hand through any of this.  They are way more focused on the next generation than on this one.  Which is, after all, their job.",3

But the doctors don't really pay you much attention, literally running from room to room every morning. My biggest issue with this place is billing, they can't get there act together. I was sent a bill of $6950, exactly the cost that was discussed prior to the egg freeze cycle. I paid the full amount, than 2 months after the whole process is over they send me another bill for $950 for anesthesia. Very frustrating when you think that bill is paid and they hit you with another one out of nowhere. I called the number on the statement to inquire about the additional $950, she tells me that there's no record of the $6950 payment. GREAT. Puts me on hold, she than comes back to say that I need to call the NYU fertility office and have them release the $950 to be paid to the anesthesiologist. So I called the NYU fertility billing office, of course they leave a voicemail at 5pm when they close. She states that the $950 is extra and told me to call another department.

Only one embryo came back for implantation- but we have a healthy beautiful baby girl - now three weeks old. My dr was DR Keefe, who spend some time with us during initial consultation, however it was very difficult to get a hold of him directly for any questions after that. He was inaccessible and his secretary at the time was new and not helpful. Apparently he is only part time at NYU and also has another practice. We would have an appointment with him regarding the IVF and it would get cancelled last minute and we had a first ultrasound appointment of fetus scheduled with him that also got cancelled. The secretary did not inform us we should schedule the ultrasound appointment with any of the doctors so we waited and then found out we should do that and it was week 8. The doctor who ended up giving the ultrasound asked why I came in so late. The nurses are helpful, especially Carol and Andrea and will answer your questions and call you back. But they are busy and sometimes it takes a full day for them to get back to you which is nerve wracking when dealing with self administered scheduled shots.  We had some miscommunication with billing and our insurance which also was frustrating leaving the patient in the middle to sort it out. Billing does not call you back unless you hound them. I don't remember what Doctor handled our implantation- but she was fantastic. In the end the doctors and nurses all know what they are doing and you can trust them - but the communication is lacking and frustrating for a patient who has never gone through fertility treatment before. I've heard other places are similar- ie feels like a factory- so I'm not sure if this is standard for large hospitals that have good reputation for fertility treatment. Maybe a smaller facility will be more hands on but have less caregivers which may cause other issues. I don't know.

Dr. Stein and his practice came highly recommended from my husband's (MD) colleagues- and it's hard to argue with his amazing success rates! After months of trying to conceive unsuccessfully, and in light of my husband beginning chemotherapy and my history of endometriosis, Dr. Stein went over all of our options in great detail. As per his recommendation, we decided to pursue IVF. From the first meeting, his staff and colleagues told us everything we could expect from timelines and treatments all the way down to medications. Our IVF coordinator, Kiran, was so incredible and compassionate! She was able to answer all of our questions usually within hours of emailing her, and stay current throughout our journey. Even when we were emotional or conflicted about an issue, she remained positive and helpful. The financial coordinators also worked so hard for weeks to find every possible way to cut down the costs of treatment, and also responded to all of our questions nearly instantly. The nurses and other physicians were also all so nice and really went the extra mile to make me feel comfortable and fully informed. I knew I could call the office and speak to a nurse at any time if I had a question or medical emergency. Even through the COVID-19 pandemic, the offices were able to stay open and went to great lengths to ensure every visit was as safe and sanitary as possible. Absolutely no corners were cut before and during the pandemic- the team was so incredibly thorough conducting every possible test and taking every possible precaution throughout all treatments. We are very fortunate that our first embryo transfer was a success, and owe it all to Dr. Stein and his wonderful team! Even as we graduate to the absolutely perfect OB Dr. Stein recommended, RMA continues to check in to see how baby and I are doing.

We had to do three rounds of retrieval cycles before we could move forward with an embryo transplant, so I was there on and off for about 6 months. My pregnancy and baby has been healthy every step of the way and we couldn't be happier, or more grateful and we can't wait to meet our little one. I worked with Dr Flisser and his assistants Courtney and Ariel, and all of three of them were exceptional. Dr Flisser always greeted me with a smile and took the time to answer our questions (and we had many!) as we went through each cycle. Throughout the process I had full confidence in Dr Flisser's medical expertise and his varying approach to each cycle, and highly recommend him for IVF. Almost as important were his team who worked with me on scheduling and communication on everything from ordering medication to dosages. Anyone who has been through this knows how organizationally complex it can be, and Flisser's team were on top of everything.",4

220,220,RMA of New York,5 star rating,"I can't say enough great things about how efficient this place is run and the quality of their staff and doctors. Although not every visit was the news we had wanted, their nurses offered so much physical and emotional support as we were going through IVF. Don't let that full waiting room turn you off, there are so many of us in the same boat. They move through the crowd rather quickly. Before discovering RMA, we were at another fertility clinic... which was draining and felt like it was going nowhere. Our old place also chewed up hours of my busy work schedule. The convenience of monitoring hours and their fast paced staff, makes RMA seamless.From our first appt, Dr. Lawrence Grunfeld was realistic, highly educated, and had an excellent bedside manner. He and his nurses understand how grueling this journey can be and never let you lose sight of the end goal. Vivian, his nurse, as well as all the other nurses I interacted with were kind, compassionate and caring. Although no one wants to pay for fertility ;) their finance team was also great! I never had to call insurance to fight a bill, as everything was explained in detail to me by the team.While I know success is never guaranteed, my husband and I were really losing hope after years of trying for a family. There were many tears and feelings of depression that this would never happen for us. We thankfully had success in our second round of IVF. If you are reading this review, I wish I had known about this place much sooner. Although an emotional and physical journey, I would come back to this place in a heartbeat. Good luck to all of you  hang in there! I hope it works out for all of you. Go see Dr. Grunfeld so he can help you figure out how.",5

We our persistence & Dr. Grunfeld expertise, we got pregnant and had twin girls.

222,222,RMA of New York,1 star rating,"If i could give this facility a negative review I would; just to warn people about the abuses that go on in facility towards their paying clients. You go in for a consultation were upon the physician promises you the world acts so positive and sucks you in to vortex of costly treatments. You then pay and your life is in the hands of overworked nurses and 15.00 and hour techs and you are ignored as are your needs. Good luck getting a phone call having someone follow up with you, there is a general number you call were you are placed on hold for a while until they decided to respond.  Your physician does not typically work with you after the consultation there are doctors who deal with the hundreds of cycling patients so its a crap shoot essentially (you may get a decent doctor you may not they dont care at all). everything is put into a computer which leads to many errors and things being incredibly disorganized and there are huge mistakes made in the process however, they will never give it a second glance nor does anyone care to. there is a huge cover up system in place when you need your records there is a two week waiting period to have a 15.00 an hour tech go through everything to make sure the info is accurate and even after the two week you still have to wait and call and harass the one number there is to call. The only part of RMA that actually knows what they are doing unfortunately is the finance team. They will call and make sure they get paid and threaten to cancel everything  unless they are paid in full. Im surprised no one has ever called them out on their abusive practices or how they havent been exposed for the scam they are. They get results or positive pregnancies due to volume of around 500+ woman at any given time,however i would not be surprised at all if they artificially inflated the numbers to lure vulnerable women into that place!",1

224,224,RMA of New York,1 star rating,"Your larger desk staff were difficult to engage and generally lacked warmth. It is here in the initial experience that much is lost. I actually commented on this ""factory feel"" while the Dr was in the room and a nurse mentioned that ""they were really trying to get away from that sense."" Obviously a comment from many patients before me....Your nurses and coordinators are a mixed group. Often emails went unanswered and I would write back multiple times to get an answer. Sometimes the answers were rude and dismissive...other times they were not.When I arrived for my scans and blood work, often times a doctor would come in, state their name and immediately begin the ultrasound...no talking, no explanation of what they were looking for, just clicking on the screen and taking measurements. I asked questions, asked them to show me what we were looking at...explain what's going on during this process. The human touch would help when a woman is allowing a device inside of her.I had ordered donor sperm and talked with the nurses and the Dr. about fertilizing half of my eggs and then pausing to see how they developed (because we were unsure of the sperm quality). After my egg retrieval, I was informed that all of my eggs had been fertilized because the sperm seemed good (even though it had yet to be examined).I wrote an email and came in to the office to talk about my frustration. For such a significant financial investment, I was frustrated that our wishes had been disregarded because it wasn't the ""typical protocol."" We hadn't been consulted before this decision was made and I'm still disappointed that this occurred. What really has become evident to me over these few months of reflection is the lack of tailoring of medication and treatment. Your team seems to prescribe a blanket treatment to us, yet every body is different. One of my girlfriends who went to you for egg storage had terrible results of 1 egg. She  transferred her file to NYU and they looked at her medications and told her that they didn't make sense for her body. They used completely different medications, timing, etc and she had great results (8 eggs). She also commented on the difference in warmth and intimacy at NYU vs RMA and has since told all of her girlfriends to go to NYU instead.I had 19 eggs under treatment, and was initially excited...until I did further reading and found out that that number was considered a stretch for my age, and a less aggressive protocol may have produced fewer, but healthier eggs. I am NOT a doctor, but the logic hit me and I would have at least appreciated having the discussion before the process began. Dr. Bar-Chama spent months with my husband, evaluating multiple sperm samples, taking multiple ultrasounds of his testes, putting him on months of expensive medication...and was never able to tell us why he was azoospermic. In Australia, our urologist sat with both of us and talked about the male body, physiology, etc for about half an hour. She then examined my husband and immediately found varicocoele, which had resulted in a shrinking of the testes and therefore greatly reduced fertility. What she was able to tell us in one short session simplified and focused the process. We spent nearly a year at RMA trying to understand the infertility issues and were never given a reason.Lastly, I have had both a pain and numbness in my right hip ever since the prescribed intramuscular self injections. At the doctor's the other day, I learned that I have hit the sciatic nerve. It may be important for your team to be aware that intramuscular injections at the top of the bum are no longer allowed in Australia, even for doctor's to administer in this area, due to it's proximity to the sciatic nerve. The risk of damage is obviously much higher when untrained patients like me are asked to self administer with no discussion or warning of the sciatic nerve risks. Self administered injections are stressful enough. This was in my opinion, bad practice. (perhaps you might want to reconsider having patients stick themselves in this risky location)",1

He's patient with his examinations and has a really calm demeanor which puts me at ease (unlike some other doctors who rush their patients through a 15 minute slot). I was on the thyroid medication on recommendation from Dr. Flisser when we got pregnant with our first baby (after an earlier miscarriage a year prior). He and his staff were professional in doing weekly blood and ultrasound tests in the first 5 weeks of the pregnancy and would promptly respond to any questions.

232,232,RMA of New York,5 star rating,"I write as an IVF donor. Please allow me the massive privilege of commenting exclusively on the monitoring experience provided by this RMA location, nothing else. Process: Monitoring is clearly done in large batches, but is executed very efficiently. There are usually a good 20 women in the waiting room, which plays upbeat pop, has strong WiFi, and offers lots of recent magazines. One could comfortably wait quite a while here, but 25 minutes is the maximum I sat through. The receptionists do the work of finding your orders, informing the medical staff, and printing your labels so that you should never have to explain ""why you're in today"". All you do is print your first name on a sheet at the front desk and wait to be called. I've spent 45 minutes max and 20 at the least here (** in total, which includes wait times for gynecologists post bloodwork and any Q&A). Results from the morning are provided by 3 p.m. every afternoon.  Pretty impressive! Also explains the sobering 7-8:30 a.m. clinic hours. Personnel: So happy to find that the majority of the staff here are female. And very kind. The nurses are sensitive to the toils of regular blood-testing and gently ask which arm you prefer; the front-desk staff always wish clients a good morning. OBGYNs themselves have been a little cold and brief, but never rude. Being treated well at 7 a.m. is more important than you might think - especially when you're bloated, tired, and have sore veins. My hormone cycle was much easier to get a hang of with this reliable and organized location. Perhaps it was the lack of stress, the comforting staff, and the manageable time commitment that supported my eventual 40-egg retrieval.   Can't imagine a way to have improved this experience.",5

Also, it turns out our infertility was related to some very serious undiagnosed medical issues (liver failure) on my husband's part. He's doing okay now, but the doctor he saw there (I can't remember his name) was much more interested in fixing the infertility than finding out what was causing it. Which is what we were asking them to do, so I can't really be upset, but it would have been nice if they insisted he see a specialist to figure out what was going on with his health.

I would recommend this clinic to any family or friend.The only complaint that I had was that they use SS#'s to verify patients UNLESS you ask for a temporary number to replace your SS#.

I should have seen the warning signs when after my first successful IVF, he told me not to implant the embryo but to do a second round of IVF so I could bank embryos and freeze them (paying even more money to RMA). It feels like the drs here see you coming with dollar signs in their eyes. Your dr will also not be the one who does the retrieval.

255,255,RMA of New York,5 star rating,"Having been through many many cycles of IVF and having experienced a number of IVF Centers in NYC, I wanted to provide a review of my experience at RMA and with Dr Alan Copperman.  Firstly, I know most reviews cannot help but be influenced by the outcome, and I am the same.  But I will try to provide a holistic perspective of my experience there also - hopefully it might help others going through the process.  We now have 3 beautiful children, all through working with Dr Copperman and RMA.  My 5 star rating doesn't mean that the center is perfect, but I would strongly recommend it given my experience there and elsewhere.I found Dr Copperman to be caring, responsive and of course highly experienced and knowledgeable.  I appreciated that he took time to listen to and address my questions/concerns and even suggestions, given that after multiple go's, I felt I knew how my body responded to certain medications and timings.  While IVF is highly scientific, there is also an art/skill in the protocol and timings, and I felt that Dr Copperman took all of my history into regard and adjusted the protocols etc as we went through to try to deliver the best outcome, and even listened to my input.  My experience at other clinics is that they just kept trying more of the same even when things weren't working.  I also like that at RMA, the process now is for your doctor to do the transfer rather than any doctor who is on duty.  (Retrievals are still done by doctor on duty given that it is highly time-sensitive).RMA also has seamless coordination with its lab, which I did not find to be the case at other centers.  This means that if you choose to do PGD, it is a very smooth process - whereas at another center, they outsourced this and it required additional administration and processes and altogether did not inspire confidence.The other things I appreciated about RMA are the efficiency with which the office is run and the competent staff.  I like that they have a central coordinator for each patient who you can reach out to with any questions - again, other clinics did not have this and you had to deal with different nurses all the time, most of who had no idea who you were or your background.  Given that you will be spending a LOT of time at the clinic for monitoring etc, it's also important that the clinic is efficiently run.  While it's unavoidable that most clinics will be crowded, I was able to get in and out without having excessive delays by avoiding peak times (go early mornings!).  They do care how long you are waiting and try to avoid situations where you have to wait for very long periods of time - which is more than I can say for the other 2 clinics I have been to.  They now also have a text survey which enables you to tell them when the wait time is unacceptable and also provide other feedback as soon as your visit is over.So all in all, I would strongly recommend Dr Copperman and RMA - we have referred a number of friends and are extremely grateful for what they were able to do for us.",5

After hearing so many good things about Dr. Flisser, I visited him with unique fertility concerns as well as severe chronic migraines (and medication to prevent them) that complicated my strong desire for a family.  I was spinning with several fears and questions even before starting the planning process, and Dr. Flisser answered every single one.  I left feeling secure in his treatment plan for me and absolutely confident that I had come to the right place.  I had!  Over the next months, Dr. Flisser tailored my fertility plan both to minimize my chronic pain, and to prepare for a healthy baby.  I was continually impressed and, honestly, astonished by how quickly and thoroughly Dr. Flisser responds to questions and concerns.  He is always three steps ahead.  He truly makes every single patient feel like his priority--a feat, considering what must be an incredibly busy and demanding schedule. My husband and I are now thrilled to be expecting a healthy baby in three months, and I have Dr. Flisser and RMA NY to thank.   Additionally, the nurses and administrative professionals at RMA NY Eastside are top notch.  Ariel, a nurse I worked with often, went above and beyond to answer my many questions, and to guide me through the day-to-day of fertility treatment and early pregnancy.  She is extremely knowledgeable and approachable.  Truly, I have never felt so thoroughly cared for and confident in my doctor, nurses, and practice.  Thank you Dr. Flisser, Ariel, and RMA NY Eastside.  Keep up the awesome work!",5

They ran blood test and put me on thyroid medication and told me to contact them when I lost the 16 pounds. I lost the weight in 1 month. I contacted RMA on CD1. The nurse told me over the phone she would send clomid to my pharmacy and I had to go the next day for bloodwork  to make sure my thyroid levels dropped.  I called the pharmacy twice that day to see if they sent the clomid. They never sent it, but not a problem I have to go in for bloodwork the next morning.  I go do the blood work the next morning and I inquire about the clomid. The nurse tells me she will send the clomid and contact me later in the day with the results of my blood work.  The nurse calls me later in the day and says my blood work came back fine, but Dr.Flisser said I have a BMI of 45% and in needs to be below 40 %. I said well Dr.flisser told me I needed to lose 16 pounds to start treatment.  The nurse said she will speak to him and call me back........SHE NEVER CALLS BACK. I was so upset that the Dr.Flisser and the nurses gave me false hope and deceived me in such a sensitive time. The nurses and Doctor out right LIED to me. I was at work fighting back tears and got so depressed. My insurance covers EVEYTHING, and I refuse to have my money given to a practice that deceives patients.

259,259,RMA of New York,1 star rating,"I am not writing this because I am unhappy with the unsuccessful results of my treatment over two IVF cycles; I came into the IVF process at almost 40 years old eyes wide open that it very well could not work. Rather, my issue with RMA which I feel the need to bring to everyone's attention is with the substandard and disappointing service and care I received.Round 1 of IVF at RMA in January 2017 was unsuccessful.   My doctor (Dr. Flisser) called and spoke with my husband and I about my results.  Round 2 of IVF at RMA was in May of 2017 we had one embryo which would be sent for genetic testing.  A few weeks later, I received a voicemail from a nurse letting me know the ""embryo was mosaic and not viable and to call her with any questions.""  There was no further explanation, nor did I receive any call from the doctor or any subsequent follow up.At this point I knew that regardless of the disappointing results, clearly RMA was not the right practice for me.  Between the packed waiting room where we had to stand because all the chairs were taken to the assembly line of blood work and ultrasound to sensitive test results being hastily left via voicemail without any explanation, to no subsequent follow up or call of any kind from the doctor, I decided I no longer wished to be a patient at RMA, as I had reached my limits with the factory approach to treatment, care and communication I had received, despite expending significant costs (both financial and emotional) throughout the process.  As such, I called to request my medical records to be transferred to another fertility treatment center (CCRM).   At the time, I spoke to someone in your records department who asked why we were not continuing my treatment at RMA.  We told them of the voicemail results mentioned above, and that we were unhappy with the service/communication protocols, and that we were taking our business elsewhere.    He said he would pass it along to the doctor and his team.   We heard nothing further from RMA in this regard. Fast forward to almost a year later, when I received a voicemail from RMA letting me know that ""my free year of cryo preserve was up.""   I am sure that you can imagine my confusion since as far as I was concerned there was no viable embryo and nothing to freeze.  Additionally, I had never been told of any outstanding issues (such as freezing of non-viable embryos) upon leaving the practice.   The person who called insisted that the nurse had left all of this information in the voicemail she left.   To be clear, I still have the recording of the 2017 voicemail and nowhere did the nurse say that RMA intended on freezing my embryo and that I needed to call her back to discuss it.    What a horrible thing to do to someone who still three years later has not gotten pregnant.   Shame on all of you.After finalizing the cryo preserve issue I thought the RMA nightmare was over.   Low and behold my husband and I just received a notice from our insurance company regarding a claim submitted from RMA for $10k for my first round of IVF in January of 2017.   Of course, this had been paid long ago but the RMA billing office resubmitted it a second time.  Yet another mess for us to clean up.   I am posting my experience with the hopes that RMA take an extensive look at your staff, communication, and billing protocols. I am still struggling with infertility to this day and it is not easy.    However, my doctors and the staff at CCRM in both New York and Colorado have made a challenging situation bearable while providing the quality of care and communication unlike anything I experienced at RMA.    P.S.  I sent a version of this letter to ALL of the other doctors at RMA and have never received a response.",1

Klein in subsequent visits, and he had always been very caring and he takes initiative in asking if I had any questions.  One negative comment is that on the day of extraction, I had a reaction to the anesthesia (which I found out more when I delivered my baby), they rushed me out pretty quickly, I was one of the last patient for the day I think.  On the way back, I felt horrible, but it didn't affect the results thank goodness.  I only used the service once (March 2013-May 2013), and we were very lucky to have a baby boy (now he is 9 months old and very healthy).",4

Then we sat down with the finance person who told us bc my husband had been voluntarily sterilized insurance wouldn't cover anything. Not one test or anything was ever submitted to insurance to even see if this was confirmed. Since we didn't have 25k lying around, and RMA kept adding charges to our total that weren't told to us up front (despite repeatedly asking what our end total would be so we could plan), we put off the process for about 3 months while we tried to figure out what to do. It was only after going to another clinic that we found out ivf was indeed covered by our insurance and that all I needed was a letter of medical necessity due to male infertility. We haven't paid anything this second round. If RMA had done their due diligence we would have saved time and stress and heartache of thinking we couldn't afford to even try.

And if I ever wanted to speak directly with the dr, I did.  Also, in speaking with many other woman who go through fertility treatment in various clinics in NYC, I learned most of the popular ones have that factory feel as many woman need help.The staff was great.  They were respectful and comforting.  I felt they were rooting for me every step of the way.  Special mention to Miriam, the financial coordinator, who really goes above and beyond her job description.I had met many of the drs during the treatment and I liked most.  Every dr has a different doctoring style, so some personalities and styles meshed more with my needs. but I felt that ALL were smart, competent and trustworthy.Dr. Mukherjee was my main Dr, and the Dr who oversaw all my treatments.  He is fantastic.  I truly believe I would not have babies right now had it not been for him and his expertise.  The entire fertility treatment process is difficult, it affects you physically, mentally, psychologically, emotionally and financially.  It is important to be your own advocate in all medical decisions but it is also extremely important to go to the BEST DOCTORS, KNOW AND FEEL that you are in the best possible hands and TRUST them.    I highly recommend RMA.",5

We loved working with Dr. Mukherjee! I would definitely recommend RMA.",4

292,292,RMA of New York,1 star rating,"If I could give ZERO stars I would!! HORRIBLE!!! Talk about being treated like just another number!!! If you want to get pregnant & you're in NYC go to Sher with Dr. T, Dr. Dicken or Dr. Wang!! They are the best!!! At the age of 36 and after trying for over a year and a half and after 2 IVFs, 1 FET transfer, & 4 IUIs, we finally discovered Sher. On the second IUI, we got a POSITIVE pregnancy result for the first time ever!!!!! I am only 4 weeks pregnant, but all seems to be going well.  :) Dr. Dicken was on maternity leave for the first IUI, so Dr. T performed the 1st one and Dr. Wang did my second IUI, both were great!!!! Dr. Dicken is amazing, as are Dr. T & Dr. Wang! Dr. Dicken sat with us for over an hour in the initial consultation and revamped my medication regiment to focus on egg quality rather than quantity.  The doctors and nurses are all so warm & make you feel so comfortable. The doctors answer your emails even on the weekends and in the evenings!!  The front staff are great too. We had such a bad experience at RMA. The doctors were so rude & they treated us like cattle! Stay away from RMA!!! Sher institute takes GHI IN NETWORK!!!! We only had to pay a copay for IUI & had we needed to do an IVF, it would have been covered except for $1,500 upfront. We spent over $7k at RMA even though they had claimed to be in network!!! What a waste of $! They also charged us $3,500 for ICI without our permission & when we didn't even need it!!! We had an extra vial of sperm being stored there and they could have used that one instead of doing ICSI without our permission. At least they removed the charge after we got our family friend who is a lawyer involved and threatened legal action. We had also tried NYC IVF (Dr. Azim) & his Gramercy IVF lab. Dr. Azim was great BUT the lab that he uses (Gramercy IVF) has freezers that ruined our sperm quality which was excellent quality from a sperm bank. This is actually the reason why we ended up having subpar thawed sperm for our first IUI at SHER (b/c it had been stored at Gramercy IVF before being transferred to Sher.) Therefore, stay away from storing specimens at Gramercy IVF. We HIGHLY recommend Sher above all else!!! Don't walk away from RMA, RUN AWAY!!!!",1

294,294,RMA of New York,1 star rating,RMA is just a money making business and the minute you tell them that you cannot afford IVF you just get ignored.  Nurses have not compassion and booking charges you and if you don't pay attention you would pay the bill without realizing that it should have been covered by insurance.  They are not accommodating and overcrowded.  DO NOT GO.  GO TO CORNELL MUCH BETTER!!!,1
295,295,RMA of New York,5 star rating,"I can't recommend RMA, and specifically Dr. Copperman, highly enough.  When you're going through the process, you get to know all the doctors depending on what day you need to come in, and there wasn't anyone I met who I didn't like.  But Dr. Copperman was ""my"" doctor and made what can be a difficult, emotional process so much easier.  I understand that for some women, the crowded waiting rooms and ""cattle call"" feel of the early morning monitoring hours might not be ideal.  For me, I was happy to be seen by doctors who do this all the time and whose office runs like a well-oiled machine.  If you get there on the early side, the wait isn't long at all.  Every single phone call of mine was returned promptly by the nurses the same day that I called, even on the weekends.  When I was too chicken to give myself a really simple injection that was meant to be administered at home, they were more than happy for me to bring it to them for a nurse to give me, and I was in and out in five minutes.  I wasn't a patient long enough to really get to know any of the nursing staff -- but I can't think of a better compliment to a fertility clinic than ""I wasn't there long enough to be able to comment.""  I was pregnant within 10 weeks of my first appointment.  I genuinely felt like the whole staff was thrilled to see our success, and I cried on 'graduation day' when I was discharged (to, by the way, an OB who 'wasn't taking new patients' when I called until the doctor at RMA went above and beyond to get me in).  It wasn't a particularly touchy-feely experience, but I wasn't looking for touchy-feely, I was looking to get pregnant.  I'm now in my second trimester and wouldn't hesitate to return if and when I decide to have more children.",5

They said I needed a referral from my doctor and blood tests for infectious diseases.  I had these done and my doctor faxed over the documents.  I called over and they said they never received them. Called me own doctor who confirmed they were faxed. Called them back and they said they didn't have them.  I asked them to look harder.  They did and found the fax.  Then I went to the office for my appt and they'd lost the fax again! After more conversation they then found it again.  Then when I spoke with someone she told me that any sperm I donated that day couldn't be used for the egg/surrogate because I needed a physical first, which they couldn't do that day.  So I contacted another facility (with better reviews than this one) and they told me that donors need to have no sexual activity for no less than two days and no more than five for the best donation.  No one at RMA told me that.  Nor did they tell me about myriad other costs that would have been involved in terms of genetic testing, etc.  Their doctors have great reputations but the office side of this operation needs a serious overhaul.",1
297,297,RMA of New York,1 star rating,"tl:dr: This place has decent doctors but terrible communication and awful staff. The stress the latter two cause is enough to keep you from getting pregnant. I've gone to the White Plains and NYC locations. Yes, Dr. Klein is pretty good, but the whole experience is terrible. I think the ladies at the front desk disliked me because I asked questions the first time I was in. They acted like I should have already known all the steps in what is actually a pretty complicated process. So when I came in for an IUI, they didn't tell the nurse that I was there and I had the sample for a LONG time. I started stressing b/c they tell you they need it within an hour. I knew that IUI was not going to take and I was totally right. I almost did IVF and I'm so glad I didn't. They couldn't tell me how much it would cost,  I had a great deal covered by insurance, but when I kept asking questions it turned out that it could still turn out to be quite expensive. No one ever really answered my questions enough to where I felt comfortable going forward. I'm glad I didn't. I stopped going for a few months and have been so much less stressed that I would never go back. I had a ""IVF class"" with one of the nurses and man, she was AWFUL. She didn't explain half the stuff that was listed in this guide they give you, and she was so disorganized and scatterbrained. Their billing practices are also extremely suspect. I am STILL getting bills for random items, dating all the way back to Feb. I caught a double billing and now don't trust any of what they've sent me.

298,298,RMA of New York,4 star rating,"4.5 Stars! My husband and I had a very positive experience with RMA, both with the supporting staff and under the care of Dr. Eric Flisser. Upon my initial consultation, Dr. Flisser spent over an hour speaking to me about my medical history, walking through potential options to help with conception and the associated factors to be aware of. He was very patient in answering questions and very approachable. Furthermore, he helped thoroughly explain what was happening at each stage pre-conception and during early pregnancy in an honest and realistic way. Upon leaving RMA to transfer to a regular OB, Dr. Flisser went to great lengths to help us find a doctor that would be just right for our needs.When working with the team at RMA, I found that I always received prompt attention, whether that be on the phone (weekday and even on weekends), when speaking with nurses and being seen. They were always reliable in calling back with results when they said they would. The nurse named Alyssa especially stood out for her personable touch to in-person meetings and calls.Would definitely recommend this organization!",4

Very confidential..are u kidding me??..yes, it was a nurse because she then called my name and led me to the doctor..oh they also made a women with a child move to a different waiting room simply bcs she had a child and it wasn't rght to be around people without any. A fight erupted. After  a 45 minute wait I saw dr grunfeld. Horrible bedside manners. He barely looked at me and my husband and rushed us through the appt. I'm not even sure wat he said. He was all over the place. We then met with kim, the ivf coordinator and permanent bitch face lady. She seems like she hates being there. She was horrible. Provided no info at all.

It costed me quiet some neuronal tissue, but that was the only problem. Doctor Sandler, all the lab technicians and nurses were more than helpful. Kirstin as a coordinator is simply amazing! Coordinator or nurse returned my calls every time I asked, emails were answered promptly as well. Dr. Sandler called me back himself several times when I needed his consultation. He helped to find an OB/GYN even though I didn't have mine, and it was extremely difficult to make an appointment. He also returned calls on evening and weekends when needed.

After a year of IUIs, we ended up doing IVF and have been successful after the first try - hooray! There were some bumps in the road however. I think he is a great doctor, but his staff is not always great, and they are the ones who make the difference in the day-to-day experience there. Their finance dept was totally confusing, and once you get into the whole IVF thing, FINANCE is a big big deal. They gave us bad advice regarding a rebate program (Compassionate Care) that could have saved us literally thousands of dollars. That was a really bad moment. The IVF coordinator was nice, but needed a lesson in controlled expectations: she told us three separate times that we were ""ready to go"" only to be told that day that our insurance hadn't approved us, or that the IVF lab was closed during the month that we were supposed to go through the process. that was really stressful.We are incredibly happy that we are now pregnant, and Dr. Stein is great; the billing/finance dept is really lacking, and the other staff is hit-or-miss, and makes an already-stressful experience worse than it has to be.",3

In my view, going with a practice that sees hundreds of patients each year and pools together the knowledge and expertise of a dozen or more expert doctors is exactly what I want. Bloodwork and other tests are turned around with amazing speed (which is necessary in this area of medicine) and although the crowds in the waiting room can be scary at times (esp on weekends) they move things along with surprising speed and efficiency.  Despite the largeness of the practice,i never had any trouble getting my questions answered or personal attention when needed.",5

Having a fancy office in a fancy Manhattan location does not make for a good practice. We requested our medical records from the practice because we wanted someone closer to our home in Long Island to follow our care. This practice did not send any records after multiple requests over the phone and in writing! Comically, a large packet showed up almost a YEAR later when we'd forgotten everything about it along with a bill for $79. We declined to pay saying that at that point there was no need for the records, we had to repeat several tests and they had been woefully inadequate in responding to our original request. The next thing we get is a collections notice. This practice is a money chasing practice that has long forgotten any morals or patient centered care. All you are is a person with a dollar sign attached and they will find ways to maximize whatever money they can get out of you. Stay away from this practice.

No sympathy, no humanity, and worse, no thought, for a moment, that maybe we should change the way we're doing things instead of plowing ahead.I also find it enraging that they cannot print and mail me an itemized bill like a human being, and instead announce in front of the entire waiting room how much I owe. I never receive any kind of cost breakdown for the services, and am just supposed to trust that their numbers are right. I have been charged twice for the supposedly yearly fee of freezing the embryos ($1,000, so no small amount), and because my insurance does not cover everything that they do, they don't submit ANYTHING to my insurance, even bills for those procedures that are clearly medically necessary and would be covered. My husband and I are now pushing $25,000 as we look to start our third cycle, all out-of-pocket.I wish that there were other options out there for women.

To date I have had the nurses forget to refer my follow-up questions to the doctor on four separate occasions, give me contrary instructions about when to have intercourse after taking FSH drugs, and screw up an important prescription (first forgot to call it in and then, because it was after hours and I needed the injection that night, made me race around town to get to a pharmacy that has the drug and pay out of pocket, because that pharmacy was not within my insurance's coverage, but it was the only place I could get the drug, or I would have had to waste another cycle of eggs). The doctors who see you when you come in for monitoring are just rushing to get to the next patient, so they offer little to no information unless you ask a million questions and even then, will try very hard to palm you off on the nurse if they can.

I was scheduled to go to Cornell and she strongly suggested I just call Dr Klein and see if he had any availability. The next day, they were able to see me, which is so important if you know how timely fertility treatment is. From the moment that I first met Dr. Klein, he put my mind at ease and was so patient with my long list of questions and concerns. There was never a moment that I felt rushed or that I was asking too many questions. You can tell when you meet with him that he became a RE because he truly cares and will do whatever is in his power to help you. I have never met a more compassionate and dedicated Dr. and my husband absolutely agrees! The fact that he personally answers your emails and in an extremely timely manner is something that is very unheard of in this field. Now the staff. When you go to a Dr as frequently as you do for fertility treatment, you really get to know all the players. Cheryl, Lissandra, Audrey, and Raquel became so special to me over the months with the highs and lows that fertility treatment brings. I would actually look forward to going to see them! My husband also really felt this way about the staff and enjoyed going to the office. When I was discharged, it was bittersweet, as I was pregnant with twins, but this meant my time here was done. Walking through such an emotional, physical, and financial process is really difficult.

The RN staff is very friendly and always follows up and I can simply request an appointment with Dr. M to go over options.

Small side note - if you have PCOS and are slightly overweight and are absolutely sick and tired of every RE telling you to lose weight when you've been trying really hard to do just that - Dr. Mukherjee is absolutely awesome in that respect.

You mean I was supposed to continue through last night?""  With the snootiest of tones she said ""Well that must've been a misinterpretation on YOUR part.  The way this med works is that its a daily injection.""   First of all, I am a doctor and I am quite certain and am very familiar with dosing instructions.  Further, the original plan of taking the injection for 3 nights, skipping a night, then coming in 36 hours later for ultrasound/labs didnt make sense such that I called the office BACK to ensure those were the instructions, They were repeated to me in the same way, so that's what I did.  Then I am told after the fact that I shouldv'e injected last night and then told it was MY ""misinterpretation"" that screwed up the schedule.  I will complete this cycle with RMA and then will switch to another practice.DO NOT GO THERE, IT IS A FACTORY AND THERE IS NO CONTINUITY OF CARE.",1

And I would never recommend to a friend. There is no follow up, there is no returned calls. In fact I was sent a bill and had to call to inquire as to why and to find out that they did not apply my insurance. ""Oh sorry it was our mistake"" is what I was told. From the time I entered the office I felt like a number. While checking out at the NYC office the receptionist were laughing with one another and socializing. Completely ignoring me as if they were a clerk in a supermarket. There was no etiquette.  I had to ask multiple times to be checked out while each young woman tried passing me on to the next. Never even acknowledging the sensitivity of why I and other patience are there. And I don't understand why the phone number directs you to the Brooklyn office instead of the New York office. When I kindly asked for a supervisor I was asked what do you mean a supervisor? We don't have a supervisor. Just awful! And to get your medical records forwarded.... Forget about it....it's a struggle and disheartening experience. I would live to speak with a supervisor of the NYC location and notify the doctors of my disappointment in the way that the office is run. I don't think the office workers realize that they are there to help PATIENTS not customers. I have NEVER even posted a review on yelp. Nor do I read reviews.

325,325,Weill Cornell Medicine - Center for Reproductive Medicine,3 star rating,"I need to start off by saying that I am not infertile and never was and did not  go here because of that. I was sent here by my doctor for a biopsy. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En…Mine was to evaluate a suspected cancer. There was no cancer. This is a very prestigious medical center with the highest level of technology and the most educated physicians. They also do the most complete job of testing that I have had at any hospital! The tests they did were very extensive and complete. They rule out everything so you will get a diagnosis here if you need  one. However the biopsy was given to me without pain killers! I asked for pain killers they said no we don't give them for this procedure.  I asked if it would hurt.( I thought it might be like a pap smear or a cervical biopsy which is quick and it is only mildly painful if you get a good doctor.) (because otherwise why don't they give pain killers?)The doctor who performed it said it only feels like ""a pinch"", you don't need anesthesia. Well if someone ""pinched"" the doctor who said that in the same way with the same amount of pain he would be screaming in pain and crying for it to stop! Infertile women are sometimes willing to endure whatever torture they have to to get that coveted baby prize. But I have no such issue and this was unbearably painful!I would have gladly paid for some pain killers with cash. But they said I could not! So much of women's health care is behind the times and lacks any direct care of the woman as a feeling whole individual. Maybe all medical centers who do this biopsy do it without pain killers. I don't know. Since this is one of the top in the country I suspect they all do it without pain killers. So it is not unique to this center. But since it is my experience with this I need to post it so you will know what you are getting yourself into. It is probably the best of it's kind. But women's health care needs to advance so that the patients pain level is taken into consideration. All I know is I won't be going back for any reason and  if you are willing to endure this then it is  a clean prestigious medical facility.",3

Appointments were rushed and felt impersonal, the doctors failed to diagnose us correctly and I experienced a terrible medical mishap which could have been avoided. Staff was downright rude and even aggressive definitely making a stressful situation even more stressful. There was a new batch of nurses who started working there a few months into our treatment. I am not sure where they came from but they acted more like drill sergeants rather than health care professionals. They seemed unhappy at their job and definitely took it out on the patients. Never a smile, completely ignoring questions and acting as if they do not hear you, talking down at patients and made me feel like I was interrupting their day with my appointment and am a huge inconvenience. These are the same people who stick a needle into you so I never said anything, but I regret it and I hope someone from Weill Cornell reads my review. They definitely need sensitivity training or a punch in the face.  At one point we changed our insurance during treatment and decided to use a different doctor who is in network, we were told if we make this change we can never go back to the previous doctor which was strange and felt like a threat. We waited to start our treatment with the new doctor at Weill Cornell based on the insurance information which was provided to us by the Reproductive Center, only to find out that the new doctor doesn't take our insurance after all and is out of network. At that point we realized we were making a big mistake and we were just wasting our precious time and money, did our research and based on national SART information decided to go with RMA for further treatment. We could not be happier with that decision, we were diagnosed a few weeks after our first visit to RMA and conceived a few months later.

It's a tough place to be when you have to pursue this type of treatment. Incredibly emotional, draining (mentally, physically and financially) and dealing with Cornell just makes an already difficult and stressful process even more difficult and stressful...I spent a year at Cornell doing various procedures.  During my IVF cycle, I passed hands frequently to the point of receiving conflicting information on numerous occasions. My doctor was always rushed; I never felt comfortable asking questions b/c he was literally always running out the door (probably to deal with the 100+ women sitting in the waiting room). A year of treatment and I found myself having to remind him about specifics of my case. I also ran into him outside the office on the street, he had no idea what my name was after seeing me that long.  Don't expect to get personalized care and attention here. You're just a number. You can never reach your doctor. You can only call and leave a message and you better be waiting by your phone (I literally took my phone into bathroom stalls like a freak for fear of missing calls with follow up instructions) - because you will never get anyone to call you back.Unlike most clinics, they don't do anything electronically, hence why you have to stalk your phone. Or call them repeatedly. It's absurd they still operate like this when any other clinic supports electronic communication. There is not a lot of transparency in their processes. Don't expect to get a lot of stats. If you go on BBC, you'll see you don't have information that other women going through cycles have. The worst aspect is their billing department. I encountered every issue possible there - overpaying out of pocket, being double billed when I changed plans, being over treated (which resulted in excessive costs), misquoted prices, bills sent to collections when I had outstanding credit balances with them (for being overcharged for services insurance covered). In April I am now receiving bills for services in November. They are totally incompetent and ruthless vultures. I'm surprised I didn't get billed for the toilet paper I used when I peed there.

337,337,Weill Cornell Medicine - Center for Reproductive Medicine,1 star rating,"I went to Weil Cornell because wanted to get a second opinion on whether a polyp was worth removing before having IVF. It was a misery all around, which came as a surprise because I know several women who had successful pregnancies here.1. At the time of appointment, they said they accepted my insurance. When I got the EOB and bill, it said that the doctor was not an in-network doctor. What kind of gotcha is that, to say you take the insurance because technically, you can bill the insurance, but you're not actually an in-network provider?2. I missed my window for getting the images I needed to take with me for the 2nd opinion, so I called to cancel the appointment. They said I should keep the appointment because the doctor would want to have background. I pointed out I wouldn't have anything for him to look at - they said go ahead and keep the appointment. 3. I get there and the doctor basically starts doing intake as if I was going to do IVF with him. I stopped him mid-way and said I'm here for this second opinion, and he said well of course he can give a second opinion, but he has nothing to look at. I tell him what day I am in the cycle, and he says well, let's take a look - and then after the exam, he says he couldn't see anything because it's the wrong part of the cycle. Note this is AFTER I told him what day in the cycle I was. Says to come back at the right part of the cycle.4. So then I go back (why? why?) at the right part of the cycle, and he says ""why are you here if you're not doing IVF with me?"" and I'm like because I asked you for an opinion on this growth, and you said to come back and you would do the exam?!?  He then goes, of course, I'm a doctor and I can give you an opinion on this - and then AFTER he does the exam says, practically anyone can look at this thing and remove it if it needs to be removed, so you should just go back to your doctor. OMG - was he unfamiliar with the meaning of ""second opinion""? If he didn't want to accept a patient looking for a second opinion, he could have a) said so to begin with, or b) said so at the first totally unnecessary sales pitch meeting, or c) not suggested making an appointment for the exam, or EVEN d) expressed his so very helpful post-exam opinion before doing the exam! What is this, a used car lot?5. In all of this, the wait time at the place was an hour each time. I said to the ladies behind the desk, is this normal for appointments to run late, and they said, yes - totally normal to wait up to a *couple* hours. Are you kidding me. At my ""regular"" reproductive endo, I've never waited longer than about 20 minutes, and that was once or twice out of many many visits.6.

He cited up to date studies pertaining to the procedures we were involved in and was very thorough and knowledgeable in answering all the questions I had about the whole process. As an academic myself, this was very important to me, as I knew I didn't have time to read all the relevant scientific literature on the protocols and procedures we were about to experience.Dr. Levine performed my egg retrieval procedure, which was flawless. I experienced minimal side effects and there were much more eggs retrieved than I anticipated. The pre-op and post-op communication was amazing.Dr. Levine is very well connected and has amazing contacts in the NYC area. As I developed thyroid issues early in my pregnancy he recommended a great list of endocrinologists that I could choose from, based on my health insurance coverage and preference. He also recommended a long list of great OBGYNs at graduation and made sure I checked out to an OBGYN he trusted upon graduation.  Dr. Levine's skills, combined with his sense of humor and vast experience make it easy and fun to work with him, which is incredibly important given how stressful fertility journeys can get. I recommended Dr. Levine to everything I knew was struggling with fertility (at other clinics). If you're considering seeing a fertility specialist, do not hesitate to give CCRM-NY (and Dr. Levine in particular) a chance.",5
351,351,CCRM Fertility New York,5 star rating,"Dr. Choi reviewI found Dr. Choi through a friend's rave recommendation, and I echo them after our experience. Dr. Choi is an incredible fertility doctor. From the second you meet her, it's obvious you are about to have science and a true professional on your side. We had been through a lot by the time we came to CCRM, as I'm sure is true for many fertility patients. But not only was she sympathetic to our situation and history, what hit me most was her determination to get to the bottom of it and optimism for putting us in the best possible position for a success. She talks fast for sure, but gets right to the point, and isn't afraid to trust her patients with information. A lot of doctors will hold back because they think too much of the technical stuff will be confusing or go above your head. But we always found comfort in her straight-forward way of explaining things, and felt empowered because we were getting all the facts. (Take a pad and pen with you for notes!)I appreciated her thorough approach especially when it led to a discovery of a small growth in my pituitary. We might have gone through even more years of disappointment, never knowing why. Her direction and diagnosis were the keys to unlocking our fertility challenges. And I am happy to report we are well into a healthy pregnancy (fingers crossed)! I can't say enough about the staff, who was so prompt answering our many many questions. Tackling infertility is naturally a really emotional and personal experience. But the team (especially Stephanie) helped us understand costs and commitments upfront, always with patience, and even helped navigate billing with our insurance. Even when another doctor (Dr. Levine) was filling in to keep us on schedule, it was obvious they were in communication with each other and checking in behind the scenes. We really felt taken care of and in good hands the whole way through. So if you are looking for an incredible fertility doctor at a highly effective clinic, I recommend a consultation with Dr. Choi. No matter what you are facing, it's worth a conversation.",5

353,353,CCRM Fertility New York,5 star rating,"We feel like it was a true blessing to have started working with CCRM.  After several failed IVF attempts at another clinic we traveled across the country based on a recommendation to work with CCRM NYC.  It was the best decision we could have made.  CCRM gave us hope that we had all but lost. CCRM is incredibly efficient and very helpful. More than that, it is clear they care about their patients which is so important during such a challenging time. Dr. Levine's approach is based on the individual needs of each patient not the standard cookie cutter protocol not to mention the lab quality is the absolute best. Even though we were not living locally, we experienced the excellent communication from the entire staff and amazing support from Dr. Levine himself. We were able to achieve success in his care. We can never truly thank Dr. Levine and CCRM for everything they have done for our family.",5

355,355,CCRM Fertility New York,1 star rating,"I was a patient at CCRM for over a year. As I read through these positive reviews, I can only guess that there are few negative reviews because A.) The practice is new to NYC and B.) Women are too nervous to post something negative in fear they could be jinxed or something. (The want to get pregnant sometimes overpowers everything else).I write the below review after having the highest of hopes for this practice and utmost faith in the extremely intelligent staff that work there. It started out great, I met with Dr. Levine in their beautiful office after being referred by one of his friends who he went to medical school with. Ironic this is the case because you would think my experience would be stellar given this fact. Dr. Levine impressed me with his credentials and background. He talked a lot about himself (he's a runner, how he wakes up at 4am every day and his morning routine, what he eats to stay healthy). My initial  impression was that he was slightly arrogant but maybe he was entitled to be- I mean this guy has a really impressive background and I wanted him to be my doctor. I was sold on him, the amazing office and the reputation of CCRM being affiliated with the CO office. I won't get too much into what happened specifically with my IVF's because in both cycles, my embryos were abnormal. I don't blame CCRM for this outcome and I don't and didn't expect CCRM to work miracles. What I do have a problem with is that after two failed IVF cycles that I paid completely out of pocket for (my insurance covered NOTHING), they have GHOSTED me. Quite literally, just never got in contact with me ever again when I was waiting to hear back about next steps. It's shocking and disgusting. Financially, my husband and I are still struggling to pay the 30K + in credit card bills we have left from CCRM. After my 2 failed IVF's Dr. Levine suggested I try taking Clomid and either doing timed intercourse or an IUI. I tried this in the month of November, 2018. It didn't work that month so on December 18, 2018 Dr. Levine called me and left me a voicemail around 4:45pm (apparently to discuss next steps for my next cycle). I called back immediately at 5:10pm that same day but the office was already closed so I followed up with an email to Dr. Levine. He replied that same evening and added his Assistant, Stephanie so she could coordinate a time for us to speak the following day. Stephanie called me at noon on the 19th and offered 4:30pm that same day to speak to Dr. Levine. I had an already-scheduled meeting at that time with my CEO at work so asked if there was any other time that could work or any other day, that I would make myself available but just that specific time wasn't possible for me. She replied and in a really condescending way said ""No and if that doesn't work, he will not be able to speak to you until after the holiday"". I reiterated the importance of me not being able to miss a meeting with my CEO and asked if she could at least find out what Dr. Levine needed, if it was urgent or if there was anyone else, (perhaps a nurse) that I could speak to instead. Stephanie told me she would ask Dr. Levine and call me back. Today is February 5th (over a month later) and I have yet to hear back from anyone at CCRM. It's disgusting and so upsetting- especially after everything that I have been through with the struggle of infertility and the financial implications that come along with it. They clearly know that I am no longer a viable IVF patient (their money-maker). They have given up on me and did not even have the courtesy  to let me know! I can tell anyone thinking about going to CCRM this: yes, they are highly qualified and intelligent doctors, however, they also have SO many patients and it doesn't always matter where they went to medical school. There are so many other important factors when choosing a fertility doctor- like choosing someone with empathy. In my experience, CCRM's main concern is money, not their patients. I could provide other examples of why I believe this is true but it's not the point of my review.  I have found a new practice (that I so far love by the way). I receive such personal treatment at my new practice. They don't mess up bills, forget to prescribe drugs I need (like CCRM did for me twice) and my new doctor cares about me- not just taking my money.",1
356,356,CCRM Fertility New York,5 star rating,"I could not recommend Dr. Knopman and the entire staff at CCRM. Their approach is extraordinary.  I had previously tried 2 other clinics and both felt like a factory. But it was a whole different story with CCRM staff and Dr. Knopman. Everyone knew my name the second I entered their office. Their spa-like waiting room with snacks, relaxing music, coffee and tea provided such a comforting feeling during a very stressful time for me.Most importantly I got pregnant with the first IVF Cycle. There are no words to express my gratitude to Dr. Knopman. She was truly amazing; a true expert in her field, took her time explaining every single detail. I never felt rushed or like a number as I did at other clinics. It was so easy to reach her via phone calls and emails. Having a tight work schedule myself, I appreciated the fact that CCRM always took me in on time; that rarely happens in other practices.Excellent patient care is CCRM's top priority. Lab work and scans can be scheduled very early in the morning which worked out perfect for me since I had to be at work by 8 am. All the nurses knew me and were kept informed as to where I was in the process.  For me, CCRM defines competency, compassion, professionalism, efficiency & courtesy",5
357,357,CCRM Fertility New York,5 star rating,"Apologies in advance for the long review, but my experience with Dr. Levine and CCRM was so wonderful it deserves an essay: I can't express exactly how nervous I was to begin fertility treatment with a specialist. My husband and I had been trying to conceive unsuccessfully for 13 months, and I had a terrible experience with an ob gyn who tried to treat me using guesswork out of his office instead of sending me to a specialist. I won't go into all the details, but this experience had been totally inhuman, awful, and ineffective. I remember crying after my first appointment with Dr. Levine, because the experience was so different. He treated me warmly and compassionately from the moment I stepped into his office. He spent over an hour with me discussing not only my case history, but who I was a person, what I liked to do during my free time, how I had been feeling about my fertility issues, etc. He didn't rush me, and he repeatedly allowed there to be pauses so I could ask more questions. I left my first appointment with a clear plan: we would start as non-invasively as possible, with a timed intercourse cycle (including Letrazole and an Ovidrel trigger shot, to maximize our chances). Over the next four months, my husband and I did three cycles of timed intercourse and then ramped up to an IUI at Dr. Levine's suggestion. Our first IUI was successful, and I am now 4 months pregnant with a baby girl!I was obviously thrilled with the outcome. However, the point of this post is to emphasize how wonderful my experience was throughout my journey at CCRM (which I know would have continued to be wonderful if that first IUI had not been successful, and I needed to proceed to more invasive procedures): Let's start with Dr. Levine, who is honestly the BEST. He took what had been a terrible, chaotic, anxiety-inducing experience and turned it into a structured, calm, and unexpectedly FUN experience. Dr. Levine explains everything extremely thoroughly and on repeat. You hear the same message over and over again, and it's so reassuring and empowering, because you know the plan at all times. Dr. Levine also has the most fun personality. He takes the time to chat and catch up, and we spent just as much time talking about different exercise classes we liked, restaurant recommendations, and LIFE as we did my fertility issues. This may seem silly, but it really changed the dynamic of my treatment from negative to positive. I looked forward to my appointments with Dr. Levine because they were so fun, and I left feeling happy, confident, and taken care of as an individual. Dr. Levine and his team wrote everything down for me, always. I know this seems so simple, but I can't tell you how reassuring it was to have a plan and to have that plan documented in writing. Dr. Levine gave me his direct e-mail, and he ALWAYS responded or called me back, even when I e-mailed late at night. I remember receiving a call from him at 8pm, 2 minutes after I had e-mailed, when he was clearly in the middle of a family dinner. I will also never forget receiving a call from Dr. Levine at 1pm on a Saturday, in between cycles, just to say ""Hey, how are you feeling about everything?"" Even better than Dr. Levine? His nursing staff. I know CCRM sees a lot of patients, but I was floored every time they recognized me and greeted me by name. They were so friendly and wonderful and reassuring, whether drawing blood, demonstrating how best to inject my Ovidrel trigger shot, or calling me to make sure I knew the next steps. They were also my cheerleaders and coaches when I didn't get the results I wanted. When I found out I was pregnant, everyone at CCRM was so genuinely happy for me, and I got so many different forms of congratulations. It made this milestone feel all the more special to me and my husband.Thank you, Dr. Levine and CCRM for everything! The incredible, compassionate work you do is so important and means the world to patients like me.",5

We were successful in our first ivf cycle at ccrm and are now 18 weeks pregnant.

Months of frustration with the ""factory"" at RMA NY, everything changed when we walked into CCRM and met Dr. Brian Levine. Instantly impressed at our first appointment, Dr. Levine had already thoroughly researched , highlighted and took notes on our case. Before even talking with us, he'd already discovered i was misdiagnosed previously and didn't take lightly how easy my case looked on paper being ""young and healthy"". After our first meeting, we were sure we were moving forward with our second IVF cycle and we couldn't have been happier from day one. Everything went exactly as planned from that moment. Within 3 months we were pregnant on our first try! He is not only a wonderful doctor, but he is confident and caring . Always a quick email away, no matter how silly or insignificant a question. He makes you feel comfortable every step of the way. He is truly an amazing, intelligent doctor. Also, to note, while Dr. Talebian was not the Doctor I met with on day one, she took great care in my case as well and treated me as one of her own. CCRM is truly the best team there is. Not enough words to thank Dr. Levine. AND TO THE AMAZING NURSING STAFF OF CCRM! Truly an integral part of the amazing care we had at CCRM.  Specifically,  I worked most with Liz, Elana and Melissa;  but they all were outstanding nurses.  They are smart, caring, and just amazing people. They really began to feel like family. Truly taking wonderful care of us!  They took the time to make sure each step was carefully understood,  ALWAYS available by email or call, Even checking on us after our procedure.  Dr. Levine was always praising his team, because they deserve it! We don't know how we could've done this without them. THANK YOU TO THE VERY BEST THERE IS!",5

He truly treats you like a human being and not another number. Their entire staff including the front desk and nurses are phenomenal.  Dr. Levine truly GETS how hard this journey is and is emphatic and human to guide you not just through the medical but also the emotional and mental aspects. The practice also has state of the art technology and you are getting the best care on that front too. I do not have enough words to wax poetic about Dr. Levine and the practice.

CCRM certainly deserves one and I am so surprised I am the first one. I am a 35 year old woman that began thinking about freezing my eggs this summer I made an appointment at CCRM NY as a friend who visited their Colorado branch recommended it to me. I figured I would check them out and then a few other known hospitals to see where I felt the most comfortable. My friend insisted that the place really has to make me feel good and at ease, if I was going to choose it for this procedure. Needless to say, I walked into CCRM in August and didn't check out any other hospital after that visit.The staff is AMAZING!!!! From the front desk, to the nurses, to the business office and of course the Doctors! Everyone, and I mean everyone was sooo professional, kind, patient, helpful and positive. The atmosphere is very tranquil and makes you feel at home. All of my questions/concerns were always answered and I never felt silly for asking anything. The process was made so easy, and I completed the cycle last week. I have eggs in the freezer:) I always felt cared for, and they were flexible with my schedule. Thank you so much Dr.Levine, Lori, Amanda, Hunter, Elizabeth, Jaime and everyone at CCRM. I'm sorry if I missed your name, I tried to keep track of all of you:) I highly recommend CCRM to anyone, even if it's just a thought.

Since I had so many eggs, my recovery was a bit more intense than if someone had only a few. I got 24 and I was monitored the entire process. You must commit to going and getting blood work and ultrasound almost everyday or every other day. This is what makes them special; they cater the hormones based on your levels so if you're getting too much based on how your labs come back- they will either lower or increase your dose. This is very special in the world of egg freezing. You can be sure that they will take good care of you. The nurses basically run the show and they are so sweet and welcoming!

366,366,CCRM Fertility New York,5 star rating,"First and foremost, I cannot more highly recommend CCRM, in particular Dr. Levine.  As already mentioned by many of the reviewers, I'm not one to write reviews but given how stressful this process can be and how difficult it can be to find firsthand experiences, I feel it's important to offer my experience.  To summarize my situation, as a 36 year woman, I had seen an advertisement from a clinic (with reputable doctors) who catered primarily to women looking to preserve their fertility versus going through the full IVF process.  The first step was to get some bloodwork done.  Upon receiving my results, I soon was confronted with the reality that I may not have any fertility to preserve... to put it lightly.  I immediately called and try to get immediate appointments with NYU, Weill Cornell...all the usual clinics.  After speaking with friends who had gone through the IVF process, I was advised how important it was to find a lab and doctor with the data to back up their results.  In doing my due diligence I of course went to CCRM's website as their work in Denver speaks for itself.  To my amazement they had just opened an office in NYC.  Within days I was meeting Dr. Levine (with my mom) for the first time.  To say I was anxious is an extreme understatement.  My blood pressure was sky high!  But within minutes Dr. Levine and his ENTIRE staff put me and my mother at ease.  While they cannot guarantee I will have a child they made me feel immediately that even though I was ""only"" going through egg freezing, I was AS important as every other woman there and my care and comfort was of the utmost importance.  I could simply go on and on about the care and medical attention I received by Dr. Levine and his team.  What was one of the most anxiety filled experience of my life actually ended up being one filled with true warmth and caring and honestly I sort of miss going there and seeing everyone everyday :)  The last bit I want to mention is that if it were not for this experience I also would not have discovered another medical situation and with Dr. Levine's care I have been able to get treatment and feel SO fortunate that to this day I can still email him DIRECTLY and he will get back to me with either a phone call or email within hours.  Never in my life have I received the attention and care that Dr. Levine and CCRM's entire staff provides.  I thank them from the bottom of my heart.I wish I could more emphatically recommend Dr. Levine because honestly my experience at CCRM and the practice he runs has been life changing for me.  If you do ever find yourself facing fertility challenges, I would not hesitate to recommend Dr. Levine. Thank you",5

I knew from the minute that I walked through the doors that my husband and I were in the best hands possible. Everyone from the front desk receptionists, to the nurses, to Dr. Levine, made you feel like you were entering their living room rather than a doctor's office. We were treated with love and warmth at every single visit, making it even harder to leave when our treatment was up. Dr. Levine is truly a one-of-a-kind person. He is extremely intelligent (goes without saying), caring, compassionate and highly invested in his patients. On our very first visit, he knew everything about me and my medical history before I even had to speak! He not only takes the time to get to know his patients personally, but he uniquely designs each treatment plan to meet the individual needs of the patient. You are NOT a number with him, but rather a human being. One of the BEST things about Dr. Levine is how incredibly communicative he is. He made himself available to me via email 24/7 and would respond almost immediately. I knew that no question was too small or insignificant to ask and if need be, he would call me just to make sure I was feeling okay about our course of action. When our time was up with Dr. Levine I was truly saddened! I strongly urge anyone seeking fertility treatment to see Dr. Levine.

368,368,CCRM Fertility New York,1 star rating,"I had really high hopes for this clinic, having read so many enthusiastic reviews and gotten references from friends.  Ultimately, I felt like CCRM treated me like a walking blank check, bolstering a fear of the unknown to get me to opt into an expensive, out of pocket elective procedure I simply wanted to learn more about (and would have agreed to if I felt they actually cared about me).  I waited over 30 minutes to meet with the doctor, who was curt, a little vague on why certain tests were needed but very decisive that the elective procedure was a must, and quick to shuttle me off to the start of at least 5 staff members I would meet during my time there.  While I had not yet made any decisions and was clear that I would not do so that day or be rushed into a commitment, most of the staff who met with me still assumed I was all in and tried to get treatments started and tests run, including ones I didn't understand the rationale behind.   In a way, I blame lack of communication among the team versus an overly salesy attitude, but the net impact still wasn't favorable.  The very last meeting was to walk through cost, so, I would have opted into all manner of procedures and drugs and only known the impact to my financial situation after I'd mentally committed.  Cost aside, while I applaud CCRM's efficiency, the lack of given time to process, understand my options and why certain things were needed, and digest what was happening felt very wrong.  The only bright spot was one of the nurses - she was kind and empathetic, probably the only person who recognized that this was a voluntary visit.  Bottom line: just have your wits about you if you go, and remember that you should ask as many questions as you need to get clarity and comfort with next steps.  And, you don't have to sign on the dotted line.  Last, be prepared - the consultation fee came out to about $200 higher than I was quoted.",1
369,369,CCRM Fertility New York,5 star rating,"I'm not entirely sure why I'm writing this here, on Yelp: somehow, I feel like this deserves more than the brevity of this site. But I want everyone here to know this about Doctor Janet Choi so that others' lives may be changed as mine has been.I'll begin with her medical expertise: Doctor Choi is the most skilled, knowledgeable physician I have ever met. That she is a graduate of Harvard and Columbia (where she also did her one of her two residencies, the other being at Cornell) would surprise no one. There was not a single instance where I doubted Dr. Choi's skills: her medical care was considered, skillful, and assured.But that's the ""easy"" part of what she does: the technical aspect of her profession.  And while incredibly impressive, it is the kindness, care, decency, and humanity of how she does what she does that sets Dr. Choi apart from her peers.Trying to have a child when you're over 40 isn't easy. Not emotionally, not financially, not physically. It's brutal: a wild ride of fear, hope, dismay, euphoria, exhaustion, elation, resignation, determination, and outright ambiguity. Sometimes, it all works out; sometimes, it doesn't. The process is like a soup made of your bones and heart. Dr. Choi, the physician, is, as I said earlier, a master of the physical processes of reproductive medicine. Dr. Choi, the healer, is a sterling human being whose ability to gently explain every aspect of the fertility process to her patients; to soothe and sympathize with her patients; to take care of her patients' emotions as much as their bodies, is deeply moving. Doctor Choi is a marvelous doctor and an even more marvelous human being.Doctor Choi: I cannot thank you enough for your insight, care, compassion, and dedication. Your colleagues, Dr. Levine; Lori; Whitney; Melissa; Jamie; Hunter; Elizabeth; Amanda; Gina; Stephanie; and all of your team will forever be in my mind and heart.

Dr. Choi is AMAZING (I agree with the previous reviews). She is knowledgable, caring and thorough. She spent more time with me in the few appointments I had with her than the doctor at Cornell did over the course of 2+ years I was there. Between Dr. Choi, the staff, the nurses, and the facility - they are all exceptional. With fertility treatment, you are always on a roller coaster ride of emotions and CCRM sympathizes with that and gives their patients the necessary education, thought and time.

371,371,CCRM Fertility New York,5 star rating,"After years of struggling with fertility and unsuccessful attempts at several other fertility clinics, I finally decided to travel out of town all the way to New York in order to start fresh at CCRM! As the other reviewers have already stated, there are not enough words to describe Dr. Levine and ALL the staff at CCRM. Everyone from the front desk receptionists, admin in the back office, phlebotomists, nurses, billing admin and doctors are the most caring, friendly, knowledgeable professionals you'll ever meet. They treat you as if you are their only patient! Everyone at CCRM knows you by name and appointments are a breeze to schedule. You rarely have to wait past your scheduled appointment time. You are in and out of there! Communication is a breeze with them. There will always be someone to take care of you over the phone, email or their online portal, hence you will always be in the loop with your treatments, medication usages/dosages, lab results, billing questions etc! Dr. Levine is not only great about calling you but you can reach him via email! I've emailed him the silliest questions and yet he was always quick to reply back without making me feel dumb for asking in the first place. It's the same thing with the nurses. They are so good about calling or sending messages via the nurses portal to send updates on medication, scheduling procedures and just overall keeping you informed about the whole process. I was especially thankful, going into this long distance. The nurses emailed me all the necessary documents, sent prescriptions to my pharmacy out of town and just made the whole process as easy as possible! Speaking from my experiences at other clinics, all of the mentioned above is RARE. What's even more rare is a doctor who is so personable and positive. He treats you like a friend and not just another patient he has to deal with. Dr. Levine has made what could have been a daunting journey, a stress free and pleasant one..and here I am, now pregnant from my first IVF cycle!

I first met Dr. Choi at Columbia a couple years ago when I had my eggs frozen. She was amazing and brilliant. When I went to do IVF last year, she was no longer there. I continued at Columbia but this time with a male doctor who I disliked immensely. I decided to stop moving forward with the process until I found a doctor and a place that I liked. While doing research for another IVF clinic that didn't feel like a cattle call, I happened to find Dr. Choi again, but this time she was heading up CCRM in NY. I had heard that CCRM in Colorado was the best fertility clinic in the country and I was pleased to see that it was now in NYC as well. It may be a little more expensive than Columbia but WELL worth it. I can not stress this enough. It is a beautiful facility -- clean, welcoming, friendly front desk staff and calm, especially during a time that can be highly emotional and stressful.I would highly, highly recommend this place to anyone considering IVF/ egg freezing, fertility options, etc! The doctors and nurses here are beyond AMAZING, personable, intelligent and kind. I have seen three of the doctors here and they are all fantastic with great bedside manner. Besides being brilliant. Dr. Choi is incredibly patient, explaining different options again and again until I understand. She is also incredibly attentive, following up consistently throughout the entire process and making sure I didn't have any questions and that everything was ok and that I had everything I need. It has been especially nice to have a doctor that truly cares about her patients. She couldn't be at my egg retrieval but called the night before to check in and then again on the day of retrieval to make sure I was feeling ok. The nurses went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable and feel taken care of.If you are looking for a place to do IVF, THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO!!!!!! I can not say enough great things about Dr. Choi, the other doctors here, the nurses and this clinic!",5

Being a patient at CCRM was a whole new game. From the lovely receptionists who greet you by name, to the amazing nurses who are always available to you, the staff at CCRM could not be more accommodating. Now to the Doctors! I almost always saw Dr. Levine which was not the case at Cornell. ( if I was lucky I saw my dr once or twice a cycle). If Dr. Levine was busy with a procedure I saw Dr. Choi or Dr. Talabian who knew me by name and actually remembered me on my next visit. They were familiar with my situation and just wonderful. I could always expect a follow up call from Dr. Levine that evening ,even on weekends. (He even gave me his cell phone number). Unheard of at other practices. Dr. Levine was always there to perform my procedures and explain  everything step by step. I have never met a lovelier, more knowledgeable, more positive doctor.  There is not enough room here for me to sing CCRM's praises!!! I am due in September with my second daughter!!",5

And he was able to help us get pregnant, which is of course the reason we were there in the first place! The entire staff is amazing -- everyone was warm, welcoming and very attentive to your personal situation. Beyond the incredible staff and care, the space itself is brand new and beautiful -- feels like a spa, which helps add a calmness to the whole situation.

Dr. Choi did numerous tests, she leaves no stone unturned, and helped us decided on the best possible plan of action to reach our goals. After our first appointment, we left feeling calm and excited about the path we had chosen. The staff at CCRM is extremely caring and involved in your treatment experience. They know your name, what is going on with you, and are there for absolutely anything you may need. It is very clear that everyone at CCRM is passionate about helping people, no is ever in a bad mood! Dr. Choi was always available to us whenever we had questions or concerns and truly enjoys her work. She is very thorough and determined to help you accomplish whatever you came to her for and will support you along the way. She is honest but optimistic, which we found very refreshing. I cannot recommend CCRM enough, their personalized approach not only makes an uncomfortable process more enjoyable, but also provides amazing results.",5

The entire team from receptionists to nurses to the team of doctors and business support were highly attentive & personal. They made me feel known and cared for every step of the way. My results were very successful and I believe it was due to the thoughtful care and great communication of the entire staff, led by Dr. Choi.

Even after being discharged to an OB, Dr. Levine continued to answer my questions without hesitation and in a very timely fashion. I wish all of my doctors in all treatment areas were as good and helpful as Dr. Levine. It clearly shows that he loves his job and is very passionate about his work.

It is a beautiful modern and clean space too. White glove service without a doubt. I actually went to NYU first for a consult- it was a disaster I felt like cattle and was totally ignored by all the support staff there despite the doctor seeming very good there too but all the rest of the staff gave me so much anxiety.

In particular, Dr. Knopman was truly amazing and went above and beyond what I could expect from any doctor.

The bar is permanently raised! He is the anti-paternalistic doctor to such an extent that I never could have imagined that a doctor-patient relationship could be this way. He was truly my advocate and we were partnered in my care. I felt empowered and informed throughout the process. Everything, absolutely everything, was customized to me as an individual human, from the protocols to the way we made decisions about my care. He even considered psychological and emotional effects of certain decisions, and not just treatment by the numbers and the probabilities. There was no detail that went unnoticed to him, and his nuanced care is truly a gift. It would not surprise me if he was thinking about every single patient outside of his office hours. It's been months and I bet he can remember the minutia and every single detail of my treatment and care. The center itself, and especially the surgical wing, felt like a spa for my ovaries (literally--there were warmed blankets, spa music, plants and succulents...). I wish he could be my doctor for everything under the sun, his team could manage all of my life, and I never have to see another doctor again. I would implore him to run workshops all over the world to teach doctors how to provide care like his. I obviously cannot say enough good things about CCRM NY, and Dr. Levine. My biggest piece of advice would be to run, don't walk, to CCRM tomorrow morning (and yes, you can likely get an appointment for tomorrow!!), and don't even think about seeing any other doctor or clinic.",5

389,389,Sher Institute For Reproductive Medicine,2 star rating,"I should have written this review a while ago when I had my first experience with the rude receptionist (I think she practices being her rudest everyday), and ridiculous scheduling system. Each time I have these encounters I say to myself how much I ""hate this place"" and then I'm reminded of the care I receive from Dr. Dicken and her patient coordinator Jacqueline Piccardo. Regarding the consistently rude receptionist, the one with the glasses who sits on the side closest to the elevator - she never smiles, is unkind, demonstrates a consistent inability to help or accommodate and is consistently MATTER-of-FACT. You would think the front desk staff would be a the softest, kindest spot in the clinic. Regarding scheduling, I've had several scheduling incidents where they call me at the end of the day to provide an appointment time for the next day despite the preferred times offered. Some times I've had to reschedule meetings and another time Dr. Dicken accommodated me despite the ridiculous appointment given for 8am. I get to the front desk, the rude receptionist goes on to tell me with the snide look on her face that she doesn't have me on the schedule for 8, she has me on there for 8:30. Are you serious???!!! I didn't even ask for my scheduled time I just suggested I was there to see Dr. Dicken. The simple response would have been okay, but instead she had to let me know that I'm the schedule for 8:30. I SWEAR I would think it was just me if I had not read the other reviews. I can't understand how a fertility clinic can be so inefficient.The last straw is this specimen that I was told I could bring in at 8am and this same rude, unsympathetic reception insists that no one is available until after 8:30. Well the damn specimen would've died by then. Right now I FUCKING HATE THIS PLACE, as I sit in the reception area crying with a specimen that I'm certain may no longer be viable.Trying to conceive when having challenges is already stressful and depressing and the additional challenges I experience with front desk staff and scheduling just makes this entire experience overwhelmingly sad.The two stars are what is left of my terrible experience with this clinic, if not for the responsive and attentive care that I receive from Dr. Dicken and Jacqueline Piccardo I would give 0 stars (if possible).",2
390,390,Sher Institute For Reproductive Medicine,1 star rating,"I hardly ever YELP but I am doing an update to say that I tried to send out the biopsy of my only surviving embryo at SIRM for PGD after three years of it being frozen and was told by Carey Dicken and the office manager that I no longer had the option to do PGD because the biopsy is now too old. When I asked why I wasn't informed that the biopsy was no longer usable I received the reply ""people don't usually wait that long."" To be specific, I waited 3 years to do the PGD because I thankfully had a successful cycle at Cornell. Why didn't I use my embryo in the first place you might wonder? Because I was down to the last of my savings and it would've cost almost as much to transfer that embryo at SIRM as it would to do a full donor cycle at Cornell. I was out of hope and trust in SIRM and desperate for results. For any of the reviews that say Cornell is like a factory, so many women go there because the care is world class. Yet despite the high patient volume, I still felt more professionalism, kindness, and 'general ease' as a patient, then I ever felt at SIRM. After going through 6 cycles of IVF, yes you read that right 6 cycles, I only wish I switched to Cornell sooner and saved myself a lot of heartache and despair. And for all the ladies that reached out to me with similar traumatic experiences at SIRM, I'm sorry I didn't respond to you in a timely manner. I hardly ever check YELP.

They charge a ridiculous fee just for consultation.  I can't really comment on the doctors here but don't think I can trust a place that's so money focused and only in it for profit.  I don't think I can recommend this place to any of my friends that are looking to find out some information on fertility options to be left feeling cheated.  This is very disheartening...,1

But this review is only about SHER: the billing was a disaster- when you are going through infertility, everything feels harder so you expect at least the fertility center makes it easier for you. First they quoted us the wrong amount, we paid everything then in a couple of weeks they corrected their mistakes and we paid the balance .Despite of all these, we had to confirm and reconfirm the payments over and over: every couple of weeks would get an email saying "" you can not start your treatment unless you pay your balance""! Hence making calls and someone didn't know about the payment and then again and again! I think in a course if two months we confirmed the payments three times. I am not sure how a lump sum of 4k can get misplaced in the system with no record, but apparently at SHER it does. Them comes to anesthesiologist which SHER hires for your procedures and it is SHER whom receives the payment. Well, turned out our anesthesia was one of the few things that could be covered by our insurance and the anesthesiologist was indeed in network. We never got the hold of the anesthesiologist and never got 400$ back nor SHER helped us through it. Anyhow I got a beautiful baby boy from Dr. Wang and I am forever grateful to him and his team.",2

I am sure they took the money and didn't test the embryo . Thank to them i am 10 weeks pregnant and I am just waiting to have this fetus dies into my body as it had genetic default!!!!! Can you imagine the trauma. - They obviously failed at an other transfer I did with them.- They charge you for everything. Everything. They just care about the money .

After meeting with me he did an immune workup and found that I have elevated NK activity. We did IVF with PGS and on my first attempt I got a BFP. Now just waiting for my ultrasound. He is always very receptive and caring. You are not another patient in a factor setting like you would be at the big academic institutions (where I got my BFN with a PGS normal embryo).

He will nonstop respond to all of my emails no matter what time of the day I send them. He is so prompt with responses to email, and for a nervous person like me this is ideal.

I was told by my doctor that I had 2 frozen embryos for my next transfer. Since my doctor was fired and the office was closed about a week before my scheduled transfer,  I had to seek another doctor. Which at the day of my transfer we discovered I did not have 2 embryos but a morula and and early stage blast.  Both which are unlikely to result in pregnancy.  I wonder if I would have stayed with sher if they would have continued to lie to me about the quality of my embryos. I find this  Institute to be unethical at its core. I am sorry for the other patients who suffered as a result of their poor management. Mistakes on med calendars, overlooking pertinent details, last minute delays in protocol were all common practice in my experience. I had a professional doctor review my embryo results and NONE were considered to be viable for transfer. They transferred 2 fresh and froze another 2.  In other words, the don't comply with industry standards on viable embryos. They will misrepresent them so you will continue with the pricey treatments. I suffered 2 miscarriages as a result of their negligent practices. This Institue took a year of my life and all I received in return was an ""I'm sorry"".

397,397,Sher Institute For Reproductive Medicine,5 star rating,"It's hard to give reviews to a place like that. Dr. Dicken got the job done on our second IVF, both times we paid out-of-pocket for everything. After our first attempt failed I went to Cornell, NYU and RMA for second opinions and also to find out how they proceed with  their protocols and maybe they would come up with new way of treatments for me. Well, RMA had a very complicated payment options. You Basically had to pay for everything in front and then if you didn't have any fertilized eggs for example they would somehow refund you a percentage for what would have been a transfer. Meanwhile, the girl who seem to be like 18 years old in the billing department couldn't tell me what the percentage was or how much money I would get back. Very shady practice. At cornell, although I brought in all of my medical records, they made me do an ultrasound and pay for out-of-pocket $900. So I figured I will go back to Sher since I know how they operate. 1. They are very good at keeping track with your protocol and followups. I've never had an issue with them forgetting to call me and inform me about any changes to my protocol. With That said, I didn't have to be on top of things all the time, because I was pretty sure that they do it for me. After all this is why I'm paying them.2. Dr. Dicken was always responsive to emails within hours, even on the weekends.3. When you create your treatment plan, you sit down with person who does billing. She has detailed description of procedures and their prices printed out for you. You can basically choose what you want and/or need to do. You also have a clear understanding how much you're paying and for what. None of the other places I've been to have such system. This was very helpful for us. 4. They also made it very easy with prescriptions, I was looking for the cheapest places to find my drugs, and they would forward and re forward prescriptions for me to different pharmacies pretty quickly. Couple of times I ran out of medications and they would actually give me meds to cover me until I got my meds shipped.5. The nurses are also pretty cool, I've never had anyone being rude or unprofessional. The most important thing, of course, is that I have my baby.

I'm really surprised by the one-star reviews on here and had the complete opposite experience, so I wanted to express how highly I recommend Dr. Dicken and the team at Sher.  Fertility struggles are always difficult, and you may not get the results you hope for, but the team at Sher made the whole experience as pleasant as possible for me, and I successfully conceived my baby girl via IVF with Dr. Dicken. And I have additional frozen embryos from my IVF cycles, which I'll transfer in hopes of bringing my daughter a sibling.  Sher differentiates itself because you really do get personal treatment and you do not feel like just a number, as tends to happen with the other large IVF clinics.  I saw Dr. Dicken at every appointment and she always took the time to answer my questions and discuss next steps.  Appointments were easy to schedule in the morning before work, and the team of receptionists and nurses all knew me personally and made everything super easy.   This was a huge contrast to the other IVF clinics in NYC, where the receptionists were disorganized and didn't answer the phone half the time I would call.  I think your experience with any of these clinics likely depends on how you like to work with your medical team- I'm always needing to be in control and need someone who will answer my calls and emails on time, and that's what I got at Sher that I didn't get elsewhere.  I always had personalized attention at Sher from Dr. Dicken and nurses Marian and Jackie and they always responded to me timely.  My husband and I met with Dr. Dicken multiple times to strategize the best IVF plan for us given our medical issues, the cost our health insurance would cover, and what we could afford.

Dr. Dicken is quite knowledgeable and has this girl next door appeal that completely puts one at ease.

I authorized a payment of $2,000, and a couple of days later there were a few charges to restaurants and Pro Flowers. Fortunately my credit card company found the charges suspicious and contacted me right away. The only place I used this card was at SIRM. And when I contacted the office manager Jessica about it she ignored my emails. It was as if I sent her nothing - absolutely no response. So be warned, if you can avoid it, pay by check instead.

400,400,Sher Institute For Reproductive Medicine,1 star rating,"I have thought long and hard about writing this review, but I feel like other people who are about to start the ivf journey should absolutely be aware of the issues I experienced. Also, for the record, I got pregnant at SHER, so I am not bitter. I think it is awful to dismiss other reviews for this reason. The first, but perhaps not the biggest, problem is that clinic is extremely disorganized. When you find out that they have ordered the wrong medication (occasionally at great expense) on the day that you are supposed to be starting treatment, the stress that is added to the entire experience is exponential, because then it is up to you to run around town to find a specialty pharmacy that has the meds in stock, some of which are further constrained by national shortages. The problem here is that the nurse practitioners are made to double up as administrative co-ordinators, a nurse should support the medical process and a co-ordinator should guide you through the process. Having now experienced a clinic where the co-ordinators support the nurses, it is a far more effective system and creates a much more supportive culture. Every time something went wrong, which was pretty much weekly, no one took responsibility, never mind that no one apologized and the next time I went in everyone looked more and more terrified and harried, but because taking responsibility was for some reason impossible, it meant that no one would offer to help fix the problem. It was very obvious that the staff below the Dr level were not getting the support they needed. Another huge problem with this clinic is that for the first embryo transfer they took far too long to transfer the embryo into my body. The embryo should not be outside of storage or the body for more than a few seconds, 30 seconds is a long time for this process, and for my first transfer it took a few minutes. This was because they were were understaffed and using a less experienced sonogram operator. They admitted to me that the operator was less experienced and that they were understaffed because of Thanksgiving. I understand that Thanksgiving is a holiday, but in most cases the Dr is in charge of managing your cycle, so they could prevent this via closer management or better staffing. As a patient we go through an awful lot to get a viable egg. We started with 11 and ended up with 3, so losing 1 through carelessness is pretty epic. The final issue I will share with you is that they told me that the genetic sequencing of the embryo is a waste of money. I have since found out that not only is this not true but that if an egg is genetically determined to be a good egg, a woman in her 40s is almost as likely to get pregnant as a woman in her 20s. The older you get the less good eggs you have. I don't know why they missled us? IVF is split into 2 halves, egg retrieval (out of you to be fertilized) and then the fertilized egg is transferred back into you. The egg retrieval is reasonably easy, 2 weeks of tiny under the skin injections, but the transfer is far more intense with months of bigger injections into the muscle. Perhaps because if we had determined that more eggs were not viable they would not have been able to charge us for as many transfers and they would have made less money?My advice is to find a clinic that has not been bought as a commercial enterprise and is not run as a business. Good luck.",1

Like they think patients don't know anything. And that's what Dr. O'Shaughnessy doing. I booked this place because I had some emergency issue about my health and it was the only place was available near my work. I wasn't there for any pregnancy issues, and I made myself clear to the doctor why I am there. After the short consultation with the doctor, they did the blood test. So I obviously thought it was for my health issue. However, next time I realized they did a genetic test through other company, about if my babies are going to have any genetic issues. I never asked for it or knew the blood test was for that. Plus, I wasn't there for pregnancy!! Now this genetic testing company asks $1000 for this test. For something I never asked for. I am not only very mad about this rip-off situation, but also worried about the time that I will waste to make this thing correct. Because this institute system is really slow and not organized.

That said I know we would have had the same luck with any clinic. I was overstimulated and there for had fluid in my uterus. (Caused by them) and then was told instead of doing a fresh transfer I should wait a few cycles and do a frozen transfer. (which would be another $5000 and the money shouldn't be my deciding factor) I said I believed in my body and why wouldn't we try the transfer because there was a possibility it would work. Then was told well actually I'm going to be out of town on your transfer day... so was it my body or their convenience. I did the fresh transfer with another dr and the fluid was no longer present. (It took) Sher is a nightmare. The staff is rude and unhelpful. Their scheduling system was a joke. The thing that gets me most upset is the lack organization with their billing. I was overcharged and when I pointed out that they had over charged me their response was ""oh did you not want us to charge that?"" Yes of course please take more money after the thousands of dollars we are already giving you. What kinda response is that?! Then I was told the overcharge would be kept on file for future charges. So I went in for the following visit and was asked to pay more money. I said is there a balance on the account. They didn't even care to check or notice.Then I received a check in the mail with an arbitrary amount as a ""refund"" for being overcharged. The numbers didn't even match.Then I got a bill for charges that would have been covered by the overpayment. Completely clueless. Then to top it all off they just decided to start charging more money out of the blue for our embryo storage. No notification that things were changing just a bill saying we owe them more money for something we set up a monthly autopay for. And back payments for an amount that doesn't even add up. Be careful.  They are crooks. They completely take advantage of the vulnerability in people who just want to be parents.",2

Then gave me lecture that how my egg will wait for 24 hours after ovulation so they can slide my appointment of IUI. Everyone knows that IUI is time critical. She also told me that ivf patients are priority for egg retrieval and my egg can wait. I do not need medical advice from front desk woman.

She is a compassionate provider and up on the latest techniques. My first round of IVF ended in a chemical pregnancy after which the doctor came up with a new strategy that made all the difference.The staff at Sher is informative and supportive. Jessica, the office manager, took a good hour to go through the financial options. The front desk staff were responsive and the nursing staff were consistently kind and personable. I saw the same doctor at almost every visit (unless it was a weekend or she was on vacation). Dr. O'Shaughnessy even came in on her weekend off to do my egg retrieval.

410,410,Sher Institute For Reproductive Medicine,1 star rating,"I should have written this a long time ago. I now have a beautiful seven month old son, which I conceived by going to Cornell. I had fibroids and Sher doctors were insisting that I have to have a surgery. I did two rounds of unsuccessful IVF (two rounds of retrieval and two rounds of transfers). I had enough eggs and that was not a problem. I even scheduled my surgery to remove fibroids but decided to get other opinions. I went to NYU and Cornell and both doctors told me that they do not see any reason that the fibroids are causing infertility. I realize that medical opinions may vary among experts, but insisting so much that someone goes through surgery without backing up your claim is something else. When I switched to Cornell, I realized that much higher standards exist. The doctor even changed the dosage of the meds after each visit sometimes changing them a tiny bit here and there. At Sher, they rarely changed the dosage and they were less meticulous about timing, weekly tests, etc. They were pretty sloppy. I got pregnant with the first attempt at Cornel and with transferring only ONE embryo. At Sher, the first round they transferred  one embryo and the second round two embryos. So 1/1 at Cornell and 0/3 at Sher. I am the same person with the same eggs and same husband and the same fibroids. I advise you to stay away. I wasted more that a year at Sher with no results and I am so sorry about it. Mostly because my dad died and I would have wanted him to meet my son. I am also really unhappy with their manners. After I was devastated the second time it did not work, I emailed Dr. Dicken, she responded with one line and repeated that I need to have surgery to remove my fibroids. I emailed her back with a couple questions and she never replied back. I then called to talk to her and she never called me back. At Cornell, my doctor called me on a Sunday afternoon before my transfer (while walking his own kid to a birthday party). He said that he proposes we only transfer one embryo (we had talked about transferring two) and that there are risks associated with carrying twins at my age, etc. This is to say just to say how much he cared.

My husband and I were ready to give up after 3 years over there. But we finally made up minds to search for another doctor and take the last IVF chance.After two months on the waiting list, we got our appointment with Dr. T. And all those online reviews are telling the consistent story. He is the person I can trust. He is compassionate and objective at the same time. He is not a magic maker but he is the best possible doctor you could work with as a man.

If you are unsure of which clinic in NYC to choose, this next part is for you. I was, too, very unsure and confused. There are so many options but please trust me and make an appt with Dr T. Sher is not a factory like the other clinics (ie Cornell, RMA). I was actually nervous while in the waiting room before my first appt because there weren't hundreds of women waiting. But I've later realized it's because they actually go by appts and honor the appts; you will not be 1 of 10 patients scheduled at 2pm. And, when you have an appt (which you will have a lot of!) you will see YOUR dr. Not just a nurse or whoever is there that day. I saw Dr T for each and every appt (except when I had to go in on one Sunday and he wasn't on call that weekend). I can't explain how comforting it is to know you are seeing the same dr during such an emotional process.  And Dr T...exactly what you are looking for in a Doctor....I only have positive things to say. Not only is he intelligent, but also kind, extremely calm (which is something I needed!), and honest (he tells you how it is, so don't expect sugar coating). You will not feel like 'just another patient'.  He actually cares and will thoroughly go over your history and make sure he treats you appropriately. You will have his attention for as long as you need; he never rushed me out. He is also very responsive via email (replied within couple of hours), which was super helpful for a nervous wreck like me. And, the best part - he was successful with us on our first IVF cycle! I can't recommend Sher and Dr. T and his team enough. You will be in good hands!",5

I was given Sher Institutes name from a friend and calling them was the best decision ever. Not only did they help me get pregnant, but they made the difficult process so much easier.  Dr Dicken was the most caring, empathetic and approachable doctor I've seen. She empowered me to help make decisions while providing excellent guidance and expertise. She provided so much calmness to me and I couldn't have done it without her.  I would recommend this group to anyone who has been told what I was, or if you are just starting off on your IVF journey.

We went through 2 failed IVFs and one IUI and our attempt with Sher institute was our last try covered by our insurance. Dr Tortoriello understood our situation and decided to make it count. He didn't want to just pump large quantities of drugs and getting a large amount of eggs, but he cared more about getting quality eggs. He decided to use a different mixture of drugs that helped us produce quality eggs and he made it count as promised. We couldn't be happier with Dr T and his staff, and can't wait to see our little baby boy in a few more months. Throughout the procedure all the staff was very helpful and responsive to our schedule and concerns and we can't be more grateful for their great service. Unlike our previous experience  in which we felt we were being treated like cattle, over at the Sher institute we felt like everyone there knew our situation and were there to help us make it happen.

After six years of dealing with, seemingly intractable, infertility and going to five of the most reputable clinics on both the east coast and west coasts, I am now 12 weeks pregnant. Dr. Tortoriello is aces! The RE before him was recommending surrogacy or adoption. I had the sinking sense that he was just trying to get rid of me because I had a complicated fertility profile and he didn't want to mess up his excellent success rates. He was resisting doing an embryo transfer even though we had frozen embryos. When I went to see Dr Tortoriello I immediately felt that I could trust him. His exact words 'You deserve at least one transfer if not more before going to surrogacy'. I got pregnant on my first FET with him. He is one of the most balanced, caring and intelligent doctors I have ever had. You really feel like he is plugged into your case. He remembers your info when you have an appt with him. He answers emails. You know that feeling, when you are sitting across from a doctor and he is giving you these canned answers, like he is reading from a script or has said this to so many people that he is bored of hearing it himself? Dr. T is the exact opposite of that. He is a real person. He doesn't make huge promises (read: sales pitches) but he is more focused on his patients and designing custom protocols for them than any of the other seven doctors I have seen at those five top facilities. The previous poster is in California so perhaps she is confusing this facility with another one. This is the most responsive and caring group of medical professionals I have EVER experienced. When you get off the elevator the receptionists greet you by your first name (the opposite of making you feel like a number, which I felt so many times at other facilities). Over the last six years I have met a lot of women struggling with IF. I have only ever heard them say good things about this facility and Dr. T. Some women gush about him. I am eternally grateful to him not just for getting me pregnant but for creating an atmosphere in which I could relax and trust which I believe helped me be successful.",5

He has the best bedside manners and always thoughtful as he explains everything that he's doing. I'm a very detail oriented person and he was great with providing information without my having to ask. He's also very open minded to hear about my findings on the internet and discuss the subject matter.  I never felt like he was condescending and he never scoffed at what I had to say. He truly listens to his patients. And he always had hope. I understand that in this industry, the doctor has to be data and statistics driven. As a patient, it's always nice when after given all of the ratios and numbers (which is a huge dream zapper), the doctor ends it with- it only takes one! It allowed me to keep the faith and stay optimistic. The staff. I could write a paragraph for EACH staff member. Each one has been integral during my journey. Yamice would always recognize my voice when I called and greet me by name when I would come in for my appointments. Crystal, Christina and Brenda were the best as they always provided moral support/ advice as well as finding a viable vein before pricking me! Ana and Thalia were thorough and would always remember my allergy. Dr. Toledo was kind to schedule a call with me so that I could ask her questions about embryology. Maha was always kind to confirm with me when she received my deliveries. Demet always greeted me with a hug even though all my 2019 appointments were with Expect and not Extend. Jordana was super organized and made sure I understood what was going on and what each procedure entailed. She was very responsive and extremely helpful. To the nurses: Molly, Stephanie and Valerie. They had the most patience with me. I had SO many questions. They never seem exasperated with me. They made me feel like all of my questions and concerns were valid to them. When I had a situation happen- Valerie was calm while I was frantic. She said that she would call me in 30 minutes to check on my symptoms- and she called in exactly 30 min. She followed up a couple of more times afterwards. She truly cared. Finally, my number one cheerleader through it all. Dayna. She provided me with so much emotional support. She would always respond quickly via email to any question or concern that I had. She was always so positive and helped fuel my ""hope"" tank. This journey was long and hard and it was sometimes difficult to think that I would ever reach my end goal. She always made me believe that I would. And I did.

Very rude and impatient )But the methods they use are so aggressive and ineffective.  They are very rigid with statics, and treat every patient like how a textbook would instruct.   They try to pump as much medication into you as possible, hoping to get the best results.  But it turned out to be very counterproductive and I am afraid its harmful to my body in the long run.  And the results are so poor.  I only got 50% of mature eggs the first time, and the second time half of the eggs magically disappeared ( I think they ovulated earlier) They use manupor unnecessarily.  They ask you to inject full dose of ganerilx every shot. They don't time well the ovulation Window.  They just rigidly go by the 36 hours rule.  (I strongly suspect in the second cycle, the missed the ovulation window, and lost half counts of my eggs.  Because the count of eggs was only half of what the unltrasound indicated.  But the doctor can't tell me why.  I even got yelled by doctor G for asking about the reason )I only found out how these things are wrong after I went to New Hope for my third cycle this month.  I was pretty skeptical about them at the beginning, and even wanted to go back to the extend. The extend sells them well for all the charts and statistic based result oredicatjoBut at New Hope, they customize the medication for you.  I didn't have to use manupor. They minimize both the ganerilx and trigger shots.  I felt less influenced by the drug during the whole cycle.  And the result was better. New hope is not the best.  For example, they could have given me the wrong trigger shot medication if I didn't triple check with the nurse.   just for the full disclosure But if I could have done it again, I wouldn't have gone to the extend at all.  I feel really regretted, not for the money,  but worried about how all the cycles might have impacted my health.  But it's my fault that I didn't do a thorough research first.  So I just want to share the experience here.   I hope it will help someone who is going through the same situation-- egg freezing",1

442,442,Extend Fertility,5 star rating,"I froze my eggs in August of 2016 and was very happy with my experience.  I was 33 at the time and when I was 30 years old, was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and had a lot of hormonal complications with that.  The narrative around PCOS for a single woman in her mid-30s was that infertility was highly possible and interventions to conceive were likely.  I was single, and pretty ambivalent about having children, and found that I was pretty stressed about the prospect of having to worry about this as I potentially started a new relationship (after all, I didn't intend to be single my entire life!).  So I decided to take all my savings and freeze my eggs with Extend Fertility.  I am from Austin, TX and did some shopping around in my local area, but didn't find any facility as well-oiled and competent as Extend Fertility (and the price was better than what I was finding around here).  So I flew up to NYC for two weeks and did my cycle.  I was able to retrieve 30 eggs, 20 of which were viable/mature enough to freeze and the retrieval process was pretty painless (I couldn't laugh or cough without a little pain for the next couple of days) and flew back to Austin, TX with no issues a couple days after the procedure.  The medications were expensive of course, so I'm not going to lie, be prepared for that.  But overall, I was really happy with my results (turns out having PCOS made me produce a lot of eggs!)In January of 2018, I was diagnosed with some adenomyosis and possibly some endometriosis and I was like ""Well at least I have my eggs frozen"".  Conceiving natural was seeming pretty much 100% out of reach and whatever you do- don't go on the internet when stuff like that gets told to you.  According to the internet, I was basically barren and destined to live my life childless and in pain... Because of the procedure, I went off birth control, and wouldn't you know it, it only took one time of not being too careful and I conceived naturally.  Fast forward to today, and I am now 6 months pregnant (unintentionally) with my first child and all my eggs sit cozily on ice in a cryobank in Boston.  I think freezing my eggs allowed me to relax and not worry so much of my impending infertility.  It also allows me to have 33-year-old eggs if I ever have the desire to put myself through another pregnancy (as of right now, no thanks).  And I went through the extra steps to go through the screening so if my two best friends need eggs, they are there for them too.  I'm happy I froze my eggs and it was well worth the investment, even though I happened to conceive naturally (they say this is NOT uncommon).  Extend Fertility is fantastic and I highly recommend.

444,444,Extend Fertility,5 star rating,"Extend Fertility truly does give women access to latest reproductive technology at about half the cost. This, in my opinion, is an extraordinary accomplishment. The doctors are board certified, knowledgeable and experienced, and the nurses are professional. All that said, Extend Fertility is a place that offers great price by cutting out everything that does not relate directly to the outcome of the process. The nurses and doctors are always rushed and not easily accessible (only through the answering service). There is also very little feedback about individual test results.An important thing to know is that egg freezing fertility medications carry significant short term side effects for some women. I wish I was better prepared for this - my ""Fertility Specialist"" (initial sale / coordinator) downplayed the fact that it might be ""normal"" for me to throw up multiple times per day during the treatment. Despite the temporary side effects and communication issues, the outcome is well worth it.

From the first time I came into the office, I felt confident and comfortable with the decision to go through with everything. The whole setup caters to women looking to freeze their eggs, as opposed to most places which have traditionally only focused on infertility. I appreciated that the red tape/endless departments etc. of a large hospital system was also taken out of the equation, and it was never a problem or hassle to get a question answered.

Conservatively estimating, I saved $50k in total, or 10k per cycle over the course of five cycles compared to my local options in Seattle. Not only are they affordable, they're incredible people. I have low AMH and DOR, and I was treated with the best care during the highs and the lows of my treatment.

It makes a huge difference.(3) The pricing was so much more affordable than all of the other clinics I visited. In addition to appreciating not being charged for the initial consult, I also really appreciated how the pricing was all-inclusive and didn't include hidden fees all over the place (you paid one price at the beginning, and that was it).Don't forget that you do still have to buy medications and pay for storage of your eggs.

I was also nervous about the shots, so they let me come in for a second instructional session with one of the nurses. I was able to complete one cycle and retrieved 13 eggs.

454,454,Reproductive Medicine Associates of New Jersey RMANJ,4 star rating,"I was quite fortunate to be successful on my first round of IVF at the age of 40. Dr. Kaser did an excellent job of managing my care, patiently explaining that my willingness to risk OHSS to have enough eggs wasn't going to be a part of my treatment plan, and implemented a much safer protocol. RMA's strong research guides treatment, saving you from having to research options such as embryo glue or assistive hatching. It would help to closely supervise medication orders. My stim prescriptions were initially sent to Freedom Fertility, and I called and scheduled delivery. Then I called to confirm a few days later. I was told my insurance went through but the shipment was cancelled. RMA rescinded the prescription, and sent it to a different pharmacy. I was not informed of this by RMA.  Later I realized I was missing a drug, Lupron, from my medication list. My Lupron prescription was sent to the first pharmacy, not the second. I needed the Lupron in two days. Since the drug companies ship overnight this shouldn't be a problem.  They promised to send the prescription first thing next day. At 12 I called the pharmacy, and was told the prescription wasn't in but the deadline was 3:30. At 3 I called again, and was told I'd been given the wrong information and the prescription arrived too late since the deadline was 2:30, not 3:30. I insisted on speaking to a supervisor, who checked and saw that the deliveries hadn't been picked up yet.  They filled my prescription immediately, so I got my drugs in time. But you'll save yourself a lot of stress if you double-check your drugs immediately.A duplicate of my FET meds were sent to two pharmacies, but I realized RMAs mistake and told the second pharmacy not to fill the order. You can't return online meds, so please check prescriptions prior to ordering. Some online pharmacies have pharmacists on call during certain hours. Try to take your medication during their on call hours in case you have any questions.  Ask RMA to draw on your body with a marker so you know exactly where to inject the PIO shots.Please note that children are not allowed in RMA buildings.  This is a very reasonable policy, given how difficult it might be for some patients to see children.  My stims took longer than usual, so my retrieval was scheduled while my mother was away. We had to leave at 6:30 to arrive at 7:30 in Basking Ridge. The earliest daycare started at 7, so we could easily be there at 8. My nurse stated that 8 is too late, and suggested we leave our kids in the car with my husband watching them during my retrieval and my watching them when he deposited his sample since the procedures didn't take place at the same time. It was January and my kids were 6 and 2 so this wasn't going to work well.  We finally hired a babysitter we didn't know very well, who kindly agreed to start work at 6:30. Another option is to contact daycares in Basking Ridge to see if any accept children for drop in care. With the transfer, I realized we might be better off calling the Basking Ridge clinic directly to ask for the earliest time so we could pick our kids up from school (retrievals are done in the morning; transfers in the afternoon). They kindly moved our transfer up to the earliest possible time, so we didn't have to worry about our kids.      RMA allows outside monitoring (my nurse told me it wasn't allowed but my doctor said it's fine.) It might be difficult to find somewhere that can perform both an ultrasound and bloodwork, but a few appointments are just bloodwork, which can be done at quest to avoid RMAs normal monitoring hours (6-7:30 am). The RMA offices open earlier than 6, so if you get there earlier you can be the first patient in line when monitoring starts at 6. Their monitoring and bloodwork is extremely quick and efficient, but there is only one doctor at the satellite offices, so it can get backed up if a lot of people arrive at the same time.   Doctors perform monitoring ultrasounds, which is extremely helpful if you have any questions during IVF. But as noted in other reviews, some insurance companies charge copays for ultrasounds performed by doctors, but not for ultrasounds done by technicians. You might want to check with your insurance carrier ahead of time to avoid an unexpected expense.Most of the nurses I dealt with seemed extremely knowledgeable, and can answer most of your questions. You should try to direct all questions to your nurse, but if you are absolutely panicking (and I panicked over nothing at least once) you can call the office and request that they email your doctor. My doctor always called me back quickly to answer my questions when he received email.     RMA has excellent success rates, and I didn't write this review to discourage you from choosing them. IVF is an extremely stressful process, and it is my hope that if you have more understanding of how this practice runs it will save you stress during your treatment. Best of luck to you!",4
455,455,Reproductive Medicine Associates of New Jersey RMANJ,5 star rating,"I am amazed at the number of bad reviews here, but as I read through them, I see most of the bad reviews fall into two categories:1) People upset at the efficient yet somewhat detached system that RMA uses and2) People upset that IVF was recommended or ""pushed"" on them when they felt they didn't need it.There are a few negative reviews that are other than this, but this seems to be the gist of most of them.I am a patient at RMA.   I have not yet attempted to get pregnant, as I am only in the middle of my second freeze-all IVF cycle at the moment (a strategy that I and my doctor agreed on.)   So I can't say that RMA has worked wonders for me, or that I got pregnant there (at least not yet) because I haven't tried that part yet.But I will say this:  if you know you need IVF, if IVF is what you are looking for, RMA-NJ is the place to go.   If you're not sure if you need IVF, if want to conceive naturally or with IUI, I don't know if RMA-NJ is what you need or not.   I do know that almost all fertility advice is that if you're over 35 and have tried for 6 months and can't conceive, it's time for IVF.  It's not that women don't have any chance of conceiving after that without IVF...they do.   It's just that it's not worth wasting time (especially over 35) with other things because time is ticking and the best shot is IVF.We needed IVF because my husband had prostate cancer and if we wanted to conceive together, our only option was IVF, there is no such thing as conceiving naturally or conceiving with IUI in his situation.   So my concern was not finding a doctor that would help us conceive naturally - my only concern was finding the best IVF clinic I could afford.   RMA had a financing option that helped make it doable, and after much research on the SART website, the CDC website, and the Fertility Authority website, we were confident that RMA-NJ was the best clinic in our area for freeze-all IVF cycles.  (And, freeze-all is much better than fresh cycles for older women especially, and I'm over 35.)So, RMA is indeed like a smooth, polished factory system.   The people who say you never see your doctor are mostly right -- you might see your doctor once in a while, but in general, you don't.  Your doctor is behind the scenes constantly checking your lab results and ultrasound results, but mostly you get calls and emails from nurses relaying the doctor's instructions to you -- this is true.   Honestly I don't really care about this.   I don't need to talk to my doctor specifically constantly -- instead I have a entire team of people who seem to be fully able to give me great care.  Every ultrasound is done by a doctor, not a nurse.  Every appointment I have a chance to ask a doc any questions I want to, and they have my entire record in front of them due to RMA's seemingly awesome technological record keeping and great organizational setup. Every employee - every doctor -- every nurse -- that I have talked to has been patient, respectful, informative, and caring.   No, they don't all exude warm fuzzies, but they do all exude professionalism and give me what I need.   There's only one thing I don't like about RMA and that is how early their monitoring hours are.   I don't like having to be at an office between 6 and 730 every other day, particularly considering that i live really far away.   But I'm willing to roll with their system -- why?Because they treat more IVF patients in a month than most clinics see in a year.   They know what they are doing.   Their success rate in some age groups is almost double the national average.   And I do believe I am getting great care.",5

One- this whole process and concept is difficult and emotional however, I personally didn't want someone being overly emotional or giving me false hope.  I like realistic expectations and matter of fact data.  I love that this place is crowded- have you seen their success rates, no wonder?!  I knew right after meeting with Dr. Dougherty that I was in good hands and have trusted everything they have told me.  I met with the nutritionist in the office and this was my only gripe- I didn't agree with some of what she was saying.  I took half of her suggestions and had success with input from another professional.  The convenience of morning bloodwork/ultrasounds allowed me to never be late for work.  My nurse, Patrice always called with whatever the blood results were and the next step.  I'm not sure why the one reviewer was surprised at a message being left- you were allowed to choose whether or not to have messages left (regardless of their news).  She was the one who called me after many months to deliver the good news as well and I will be forever grateful for her professionalism and directness.   I had a traumatic egg retrieval (a cyst burst and blood pooled in my abdomen- SOOO painful!!)  At first the nurse told me it was okay to be uncomfortable but she also sprang into action when I told her it was comfort it was pain.  The doctor and anesthesiologist attended to me right away, got me comfortable and got my eggs out.  My specific doctor also called me later that day to check up on me as well as the following day.  This place is amazing and I will be forever grateful to them.  In short- if you want someone to hold your hand,  blow smoke up your ass and beat around the bush- just keep trying on your own.  You have to trust that their treatment plan is individualized to you based on their recommendations.  This is NOT a waste of money or time if you are realistic.  As much as I wish it was a perfect happy outcome for everyone, it's not.  You can't blame everyone who's trying to help... it's called the  RMANJ will help you along that path.  Good vibes to all the want to be moms and dads!",5

Our goal was to go to IVF, however, the doctors would never let us because I didn't produce enough follicles. I told them from the very beginning that I wanted to try IVF no matter what because I know IUI does not work for our situation. They said okay, as long as I have 2-3 follicles showing. I had two follicles showing and they still refused to move to IVF. The doctors were very nice and very convincing that they only wanted the best for me. I truly believe that they saw me as a person that would not succeed with IVF and it would hurt their statistics. They just kept telling us that our chances of conceiving via IVF were really low and that we would waste our money trying.   To make a very long story short...I switched to another doctor at another fertility center (Dr. Nasseri at Valley Fertility Center) They listened to what I wanted. We ended up doing IVF and now we have two very healthy baby girls! If we had stayed with RMA, we would never have been blessed with our two little angels.

I've had problems staying pregnant and it turned out that I definitely needed to do IVF in order to have a healthy baby. I was 38 when I first went in, now I'm 39 when I'll be giving birth. It stuck the first time! It doesn't matter on the age, it matters on the person. The entire process was very tiring, taking shots in your stomach and giving blood almost every other day and popping pills and having my husband put a needle in my back every night for months was definitely draining. But worth it :) we got lucky with the first batch of eggs they took out of me...they took out 23 eggs (which is a lot) and when fertilized only 2 of those eggs were good. I suggest you definitely pay the extra $$$ on getting the eggs tested or there's a good chance you will have a miscarriage and have to go through the entire ordeal over which sucks.

Like most of the patients we were already very frustrated, and quite hopeless when we first walked into RMA office in Morristown. Suffering multiple miscarriages is very difficult for any couple. Going to our first meeting was a big step. From our first discussion, Dr. Forman educated us on all of the risk factors that we faced and helped us weigh the best way to achieve parenthood. His calm and confident demeanor helped us understand that, although nothing was guaranteed, we were also not alone. The staff at RMA, from the wonderful team of nurses to Sonia (will always have a spot in our hearts) at the front desk, were always so encouraging every step of the way. It made us feel like everyone was in our corner and pulling for a positive outcome. Unlike the lucky couples that were successful the first try we had a few more stumbles. It got even more difficult watching multiple new classes of hopeful parents in the waiting rooms with us.  Dr. Forman and the staff were there again to inform us of our best options to succeed and help us continue on. Because of the commitment to us, on February 1, 2016 we welcomed our little miracle into this world, our precious daughter. We are both so much in love with our little girl that has changed our lives forever. All of the hardship, the emotions, and the sacrifice that felt like they would never end are now replaced by laughter, hugs, kisses, and the love of our little girl. We wanted to thank the entire RMA staff, your team of doctors, and especially Dr. Forman for making our dream come true.",5
470,470,Reproductive Medicine Associates of New Jersey RMANJ,4 star rating,"My experience with RMA was a very good one. Like any big office running a large complex operation, they have a system to get things running smoothly and you, as a patient, are part of the system. There are many people there going through the same troubles as you. However, I have read some reviews that seem very disturbing to me. And I believe it all comes down to the following: If you feel more comfortable with your doctor calling you and interacting only with you at most of your appointments through your ivf journey, then you need a smaller fertility office. RMA is simply too big. But because of this very reason, you have an assigned nurse that follows you case, calls you almost every other days, a computerized system that gives everyone involved instant access to detailed records, and several doctors putting their brains together to discuss your case. They have the resources, and the results to prove that they have indeed helped a lot of people. I went to RMA of Englewood a few times but decided to go to RMA of West Orange instead for most of my monitoring.  Personally, I preferred the nurses at West Orange. In terms of doctors, I dealt with a few of them and I clicked with some of them better than with others, especially Marcy Maguire, my doctor. However, for me, all the doctors I dealt with were extremely focused on their jobs, and on what they were doing. Some nurses are sweeter than others, some are more experienced in dealing with human emotions during this difficult process some of us have to go through. I can tell you one thing, I got pregnant on my first try at IVF with RMA. I have a beautiful healthy daughter who is soon turning 3 years old. I went back to RMA to try to have a second baby and this time it simply did not work. The first time I did have to pay because my crappy insurance got away with not having to cover me. The second time, I did have to pay my $50 copay during some of my monitoring visits, but it is not RMA who sets those fees. It is my insurance company. The insurance i have now did cover the cost of my second transfer. I will say this. RMA is a reputable business. They do care. They do a great job for many. They have a philosophy and they stick with it. They don't like to do multiple embryos unless it is necessary. The customize your treatment according to your blood work, your health status, and they carefully assess your emotional state, and your expectations. They are there to help us conceive. And they certainly try to do a good job for all. However, it is a difficult thing to tell some of us things we are sometimes not prepared to hear. And some nurses and doctors are better than others at relaying messages over the phone about lab results that are sadly negative. I had a weekend nurse told me how my beta markers were negative and while I was trying to get a grasp of this terrible news, she was telling me I still needed to get back for one more blood test. But I literally could not hear a word she was saying and she then told me to find the number of the pharmacy I needed to go to get more Endometrium, which I still needed for two more days, and had ran out of. I was a wreck and she seem to feel this was the right moment to send me off to find some number to some pharmacy, etc etc. But this was not the general experience with RMA, these were isolated experiences. Some nurses express empathy better than others. Some doctors walk in and are all focused on your transfer and don't really smile, and some treat you very attentively and are very sweet. Personally,  I have learned that us the patients, the doctors, and the nurses all deal with this process differently and you can not be all tuned in with each other at all times. What matters is that they do a good job. Can they improve I'm some aspects, of course. But how you can control every staff member's reaction and way of communicating at all times any facility is a bit tricky. They have managed to streamline this ivf process in a way that provides the best results for the biggest number of people. I will go try ivf one more time with RMA. I would tell every patient the following, for me the worst part to control through this journey was my emotions, my anxiety, and my stress. It was mostly me, my behavior and my expectations from them and with how I was feeling about my own situation at any given time through out any given day, not them as much as my need to do my part and calm down under this stressful situation of having trouble conceiving.",4

They have misfiled codes with my insurance company causing me to have to sort everything out for them, it now appears they've lost blood tests and all the while they've been incredibly inefficient on other fronts.

481,481,Reproductive Medicine Associates of New Jersey RMANJ,5 star rating,"RMA is one of the top IVF practices in the country. It's pretty much them, CCRM in Colorado and a handful of others leading the major developments in the field. So you are getting the most advanced care you can get, probably anywhere. Dr. Scott, Dr. Forman and the fellows publish the research. If you search for Scott on Google Scholar you'll see on their latest publications. I enjoyed reading these since it gave me insights into my own clinical care. Not surprisingly, they are one of the highest volume clinics in the country, over 3,000 IVF cycles a year when I went there. But surprisingly, the politeness and warmth of the staff if very good. It doesn't feel like a factory even though they are dealing with vast numbers of patients. You are assigned a nurse coordinator who is your primary contact throughout and a financial counselor. The front desk staff is unfailingly kind, especially Miss Harriet in the Somerset office. Clearly the partners -- Scott, Drewes and Berg -- care a lot about patient experience and someone is ensuring that patients are always treated kindly. I saw Dr. Bohrer and liked him very much. Humble, humorous, kind. Always a pleasure to deal with him, even during morning monitoring when you know he's busy. I would've preferred to have more discussions of the latest research with him but I was still very happy.Finally, a word of caution: by default, RMA gives nearly all the interventions to everyone, even if you might not need it. Everyone gets drugged up with many medications. (Personally, I didn't take the steroids or the antibiotics because I couldn't find sufficient evidence in the literature that they made a difference. I also negotiated with them to do a more natural-style cycle that wouldn't involve any medication after the transfer.) All embryos get extended culture, assisted hatching and 84% get ICSI. Many get the CCS genetic testing. In the end, we had a ton of stellar embryos, so we didn't need all the interventions. If it is ever discovered that these interventions are hazardous to the offspring -- and some such as CCS are so new they haven't been studied much -- I will feel terrible. Had I known how well we would do, I think I would've gone to a lower-tech clinic and not done extended culture, ICSI, CCS, etc. But that's with the clarity of hindsight. All I'm saying here is that you should question them about every intervention. You can decline ICSI. You can decline the antibiotic. They want to give you all this stuff because it MIGHT help. For me, I wanted proof that it would definitely help before I exposed myself or my embryos to it. That said, I still wish I hadn't caved to their pressure on ICSI and CCS.",5

491,491,RMA of Philadelphia,1 star rating,Do not go here!! They only care about the money and your treatment plan will not be personalized. Plus your plan is dependent on whether or not you have coverage. Their success rates are so high because they essentially say they can't help you anymore after 2 unsuccessful ivf attempts if you don't have insurance. The billing department was very rude and made me realize how money centered they are. I switched to another practice and finally got to experience a truly patient centered approach. Let me numbers speak for themselves. When I left here/got kicked out at 31 I was told my only option was donor egg/embryo. Diagnosed low AMH at age 30. RMA: pregnant 0/6 cycles (4iui 2ivf) and about 30k in debt. Cooper reproductive: Pregnant 3/7 cycles (3rd is 4m/o baby boy I am holding right now) about roughly 2k in debt (that could be an over exaggeration). Learn from my mistake and don't waste your time or money.,1
492,492,RMA of Philadelphia,5 star rating,5 stars does not do RMA justice! We have been beyond satisfied with the care that we have received by the entire RMA team.

I started taking a friend there (who needed some assistance due to language barriers) about 1.5 years ago. I should've trusted my instinct, because I had nothing but problems from the beginning. The nurses were rude, the staff unorganized, a huge mess. But we proceeded anyways. The doctor never once called personally to deliver any test results or ask how were doing.... The most impersonal experience for such a personal thing. The only time the doctor called me throughout process was to apologize after one of the nurses yelled (and I mean yelled) at the patient. I could write a book and go on and on about the horrendous experience we had there. To make a long story short, after 2 failed ivf cycles, I found it appalling that once again the doctor couldn't call me himself to deliver the terrible news. In fact, the nurse that called me wasn't the nurse I even normally worked with- some random lady I don't think I've even met....So really, go somewhere else. For such a personal topic, this place makes it so impersonal. You don't feel connected or welcome, it feels like they literally just go through the motions. And sometimes that's not even done properly. If I could give this place 0 stars, I would. It absolutely stinks.",1

According to statistics, at 35 with poor ovarian reserve, I had a low chance of conceiving, but I did with God's and all the Doctors' help. I only ended up with 4 embryos and transferred 2, one of which wasn't close to being a blastocyst. I wanted to transfer 3 but Dr. Freedman wasn't having that so I prayed my 2 would stick, since my other 2 didn't make it to the freezer.

The Jefferson office saw us so much that they would greet us by name and pick up conversations where left off.  That's pretty impressive given that appointments are quick and happen super early in the morning.  I was actually quite shocked and disappointed by the contrast when I finally transferred to my OB. After seeing my developing embryo up close for the first few weeks, I couldn't believe that the OB office had so little technology. Dr. Gutmann is smart, thoughtful, listens well, is unfailingly persevering, and kind.

During my tube test I hyperventilated I was in so much pain. At the end of the procedure, Dr Orris took his gloves off and left the room without any words. Two nurses joined the one who was helping and my husband was panicked. Leading up to this Dr Orris was flipid numerous times when we had questions. After this we decided to switch to Dr Glassner. We met with him and his PA. When describing how both procedures went, she stated she had them and they weren't bad. I couldn't believe how dismissive they were as well about my experience.

This info would have changed our entire plan.  We were told from our new clinic that the lab Main Line uses is not as accurate with AMH levels as other labs that are used by other clinics. Was told not to do Shared Risk where I would get my money back if it didn't work out because ivf would work for me the first time, and again, obviously we lost all our money. The doctor's answer to this was she would give me a discount next time. After losing my $14,000 within 24 hours, I was then charged $25 for my records. That was a low blow but I understand it's policy. I also was permitted to do 7 iuis at $400 a try and never told to stop although research shows we had like an 8% of it working after the third try was unsuccessful.  (Wish I knew that at the time) With that said, I would recommend them for IUIs since they are much cheaper than other places.

I honestly feel like they took time and money from me and my Husband during this hard time. Also, I feel like they truly do not care about individualized services as we were passed around from Dr. to Dr. during our entire time with them.

518,518,Main Line Fertility,1 star rating,"My wife and I were not able to benefit from IVF, so ended up going through the egg donor process.  Since you are here, you realize this is a difficult time, that is very emotional, and very costly.  MLF has the following going for it: In Philadelphia area, they have the most amount of donors.  That is about it.Their attitude and service is deplorable.  Below are some examples about the service we received1) My wife thought it was odd that she paid a co-pay for labs only (drawing blood). WHen typically going to a lab you pay co-insurance, not co-pay. You typically pay co-pay when seeing a provider.  During these lab visits she did not see a provider, they only drew blood2) They were constantly late for their appointments, even if you were signed up for the very first appointment of the day3) The nurses do the monitoring, not the doctors.  You rarely see the doctor.  Other places you see a doctor more often (e.g., RMA), where you talk to your doctor and ask questions4) They are adamant the egg donor fee is not covered by any insurance.  I spent close to a year going back and forth with them and the insurance company. My insurance company explicitly told me they would cover (via flexplan) - they just needed certain information. They even showed me the flexplan policy on the insurance website (public access)  I called MLH at least a 2-3 dozen times (does not include the times my wife called) and they would a) Not return calls after leaving voicemails, emails, and messages at the reception, and 2) refused to give information.  One person, at the billing department, was incredibly rude to me and hung the phone up on me a few times. Don't worry, she did this to the insurance company agents as well.  They would refuse to fill out the insurance provided documentation.  I asked my insurance company to call this rude person, and they did multiple times not getting information.  At one point, the representative at the insurance company told me she has never spoken to anyone who was so rude...on top of that, MLF accused the insurance claims agent of trying to get MLF to commit insurance fraud! Why would the insurance company want a doctor to do this is beyond me.  In the end, after almost a year, my insurance company gave up, and DID pay the flex plan claim ($1,800).So, unless you are desperate for their donor bank, avoid this group like the plague  There are much better groups out there (e.g. RMA).  Unfortunately MLH treats their patients poorly, and why would you want to go through this during such an emotional period.  If we decide to go through egg donor again, we are not using them - the emotional stress is absolutely not worth it.",1
519,519,Main Line Fertility,1 star rating,"I was a former patient of Dr. Glassner's,  and had two successful pregnancies via IVF in 2006 and 2009.  Earlier this spring, we went back to MLF in the hopes of conceiving our third child using frozen embryos.  Dr. Glassner spent approximately five minutes with me during the initial consultation to determine the 'plan' (and I use that term generously).  He was clearly in a rush, and I left the meeting feeling not completely comfortable with the information I""d been given. Long story short, the subsequent transfer resulted in a chemical pregnancy, and we have no embryos left to try again. I didn't start this process expecting any guarantee of a pregnancy. What I did expect was that I would receive the appropriate time and care that I deserve as a patient at this practice.  The specifics of my situation were not taken into consideration by Dr. Glassner, simply because he is so busy with so many patients. We had issues with him years ago during our initial IVF attempts- he rushed through some of the decisions he needed to make, and prematurely drew a conclusion about our chance of conceiving that turned out to be completely inaccurate. I believe that Dr. Glassner is most likely talented serving patients who are the 'toughest' cases- the ones he finds especially interesting, unique or challenging. Everyone else- coming in with 'unexplained infertility'- may find themselves trying harder to get his attention, or, unfortunately, having their case mishandled by his  lack of attention to detail. This is a large practice,  so you must expect to be treated like a number- therefore, you need to demand attention to receive the appropriate care that is best for you and your family. Don't be satisfied with sloppy answers that don't quite make sense- make them do their job.  A big part of why this practice has such high success rates is because they are aggressive in treatment, and high-throughput. You need decide how comfortable you feel with this approach.The staff, however is excellent- I found all of the nurses extremely supportive and efficient. They really are the ones who have to keep things running, and deal with whatever the doctors aren't saying to patients.  Billing is a different story.  We were charged an embryo storage fee for embryos that no longer exist, and despite the fact that I've contacted their office multiple times, I've now received a notice from a collection agency for the amount due.

There are early morning appointments at 7 am which made it easy for me to balance work and my frequent appointments.  Reaching the office by phone was never an issue. The office never left me on hold for extended periods of time nor did I have to wait for someone to pick up the phone.  Michelle at the check-out desk is friendly and very accommodating.  The office is run extremely efficiently, which I truly appreciate since I was often there 3 times a week.  The Ultrasound techs and nurses are experienced, knowledgeable and empathetic.  I always felt that I was under exceptional care. A Doctor or RN was always available to answer my questions or concerns.  On my initial visit, Dr. Glassner assured me that I would be able to get pregnant within the year, with some work. Dr. Glassner was very confident and direct with his plan of action pending my test results. Dr. Glassner laid out the options for my care and based his recommendations on my family planning goals. I was glad that all of my procedures were done in the BM office and I did not have to go elsewhere.  I appreciated the way the options were presented to my husband and me with our needs in mind. We initially chose to be aggressive and go straight to IVF.  We did 3 cycles of drugs and 3 egg retrievals.  The IVF RNs are fantastic - Peg, Nikki, Kristen and Bridget were excellent to work with.  I was well trained in the self-injections. The nurses are unbelievable and they made it very easy. I was impressed with their positive attitude and empathy. The OR staff are exceptionally positive and supportive. This was my first experience with anesthesia and I was nervous. The staff was wonderful.  They made the experience a pleasant one. We utilized PGD and we were very glad that we chose to get the embryos tested. Tiffany was extremely helpful in our decision to go with PGD. We submitted this to our insurance after the procedure and to our surprise,  insurance covered the PDG minus the currier fee.  After we had 2 failed transfers, we met w Dr. Glassner for next steps. At that time, we decided to take a step back and try IUI. Kathy, Marg, Shirl and Allison were fantastic. We did two rounds of IUI, the second round in combination with acupuncture.  The second round of IUI, we achieve success!  The billing can be difficult to understand.  I would suggest that you keep on top of the billing department to ensure all claims are submitted and paid.  This was the only frustration I had during the office experience.   Ensure you know the billing POC and where to contact her.  I suggest letting your partner worry about the finances so that you can concentrate on getting pregnant. Dr. Glassner and the rest of the staff at MLF are exceptional people.  I have never been to a physician's office that was so well run from the front desk to the clinical staff.  Thank you MLF!  We are so fortunate to have a beautiful baby girl thanks to Dr. Glassner and his excellent team.",5

My husband and I were recommended to his practice after trying to become pregnant for a year unsuccessfully. We were intimidated at first, we had no idea of what to expect. The minute Dr. Glassner introduced himself and shook our hands, we knew we were in the right place. His opening line was, ""If you follow my directions, you will be pregnant."" After a few cycles of clomid, he was right. Three successful pregnancies later, we express our gratitude to Dr. Glassner and his staff everyday. He helped us through each pregnancy and never lost hope. He is an amazing and compassionate man. His office staff is warm, welcoming and so pleasant. They are optimistic and celebrate every positive sign with you. I enjoyed visiting their office. I never had a difficult time with scheduling and was always greeted with smiles and even hugs!

530,530,Main Line Fertility,1 star rating,"When I went to Main Line Fertility, I was a perfectly healthy 38 year old woman with NO reproductive problems. The problem was not on my end. I went to be inseminated with a sperm sample I had purchased from a sperm bank. The doctor refused to let me try a natural insemination and insisted that I go on Clomid in order to ""assess my fertility"" although the doctor knew that I did not have any reproductive problems. In fact, after one round of Clomid, the doctor told me and I quote, that I was a ""very fertile 38 year old."" Well, that did not last long, because guess what? He made me continue on Clomid and after the second round which was just one round after the ""assessment"" round,, I suffered a rare side effect from the drug which is a thinning of the uterine lining. This only occurs on about 1% of women who take Clomid, or so I was told. I went off the drug, but then when I went back to get tested, my uterine lining was still too thin. It never recovered after many months. Right after that my periods became very light and only lasted about two days. That has not changed since I went to Main Line Fertility. I gave up hope and told them to donate the sperm sample. They never told me about any paperwork at that time that had to be filled out. Now, six years later, I still have no children because the doctor ruined my chances of that, and now I have collection agencies calling me for $400 for some ""storage fee"" I never heard of until now. Are they kidding me? Now I have to again be emotionally traumatized as I attempt to fight this fee I didn't know about. I NEVER told them to store that sample and they never mentioned any fee to me when I was there. I have moved on but they keep re-injuring me emotionally by giving me collection calls. I can't believe that a doctor who ruined my chances of having children now wants me to pay for the storage I never agreed to! Avoid this place at all costs, especially if you do not have any reproductive problems on the female side! ZERO compassion.",1

I was shocked because they had not even suggested that something was not going well. They are not straightforward with you. Further, they do not treat their patients well. I rearranged my schedule for a 7am appointment and arrived to find the doors locked. I had to stand outside in the rain for 20 minutes before someone could let me in despite numerous calls to the center which went unanswered. I could not contact anyone for a few days  about future cycles, phone calls went straight to voice mail. Unfortunately these are only a few of my grievances with Mainline, but you get the idea.

I've visited all 3 offices (bryn mawr, paoli and west chester) and had wonderful experiences at each. There were times I felt depressed, scared and unsure and left the office smiling confident and optimistic because they really know what they are doing and know how to talk to you. Dr. Brasile went over all possible options regarding medications and answered my questions regarding other ""natural"" remedies thoroughly and honestly and discussed side effects and potential plans going forward depending on many scenarios. Not once did I feel rushed through an appointment, or like I had unanswered questions. I've even gotten to appointments early and bumped into the Dr in the parking lot and she recognized me by face and name and pleasantly chatted as we walked to the office together.

If you do, the person will have no familiarity or concern for your case. If you have specific medical concerns, you will need to remind every single medical ""professional"" of them, because they will not read your chart.

534,534,Penn Fertility Care,1 star rating,"Run, seriously run I have never dealt with a more incompetent group of people in my life. My wife chose Penn and unfortunately I didn't read the google and yelp reviews. They're 100% accurate We started with penn sometime in the summer of 2018. We waited 3 months to get an appointment with Edwards. That's the first and last time I've ever seen that doctor. For 14-16 months we discussed treatment plans with a revolving door of nurses. Makes you feel real confident. So the first unpleasant surprise. They make my wife take a HSG test. At no point was this explained that it would essentially be billed as a surgery or a procedure. Fun surprised when a 2400 dollar bill shows up because of our deductible. Doing research the avg price for an HSG in Philadelphia is 400-600. Somehow at Penn it cost 4-5x the avg in the same city. Then I started noticing they were charging us 2 co-pays per visit, from 2 separate doctors. Edwards who we saw once in 16 months and another doctor we never even heard of. So every single visit we were being charged 120 dollars. So after the HSG, they determined that my wife had a blocked tube. She doesn't have a medical history that would lead to this happening and they offered no explanation how this would occur. (Fun Fact her tubes not blocked, these goofs can't apparently figure out their own test) So for months they would have my wife come into office 4-6's times a month to monitor the size of the follicles. Mind you we're operating under the assumption that she can't get pregnant if she's right side dominate. So every month we're looking at close to 500 dollars in co-pays for these constant ultrasounds Then the final straw. We get approved for iui treatments from my insurance. My wife comes in and yay follicle on the left side. They tell us come back 2 days later so we can measure the follicle again. 2 days later and now the right side is dominate. Well this is interesting because 2 days prior she apparently had no follicles on the right side. Now once again with the revolving door of nurses. The nurse walks in celebrating apparently not knowing that my wife's right side tube is blocked (once again it wasn't, but unfortunately we had no clue thanks to the medical experts at penn). I almost lost my shit and snapped at this woman. I work in sales for a living, I never go into a meeting with a client not knowing every piece of info we have on them. But it gets better. So now my wife is apparently right side dominate this month. The nurse looks at us and says, well come back into 2 more days and we will check again. There goes another 120 dollars. So 2 days later back in the office and now magically the left follicle has disappeared and they don't know if my wife ovulated. Then the nurse thinking my wife's right tube is blocked says, hey maybe we try the iui this month. So we should waste a procedure that we have a limited number of that won't work???? Also you don't even know if she already ovulated.  That was our last visit We chose a different fertility clinic, one that's highly recommended. Magically my co-pay is 40 per visit and they don't charge us double. Told us they're not sure why they would have to bill us twice for once visit. Have had 4 visits and every-time I see the actual doctor. Best part of during the consultation he sat there bewildered by my wife's chart and not understanding what the fuck Penn was trying to do. Also figures out my wife's tube wasn't blocked. Seriously run the fuck away from this place.",1

As opposed to one of the doctors at Shady Grove who was extremely pessimistic and basically said there wasn't much he could do to help me and that I had a 'really tough case'.

In fact we changed fertility clinics to Penn because our previous doctor (who shall remain nameless but let's just say he was based at Bryn Mawr Hospital) didn't have a very good manner of explaining this to us. We were well aware of the odds against us, and he basically acted like he was doing us a favor by even trying to treat us because chances are it wouldn't work. Very discouraging. Top it off with the errors his staff were making during our care there, and our experience stunk at that location. We researched and decided to switch to Penn. You see, there is a way to explain these things in a realistic manner, yet do it in a positive way to encourage instead of discourage. The doctors we dealt with at Penn were excellent at this. We truly felt like the staff was rooting for us instead of treating us like we were a burden due to our circumstances. And the bottom line...

541,541,Penn Fertility Care,1 star rating,"First thing I'd like to say is that anyone looking for fertility intervention should read 'Making Babies' by Sami S David & Jill Blakeway. The first chapter is all you need to read to understand what is happening at Penn Fertility Care. I went there in February of 2016. I had no issues with their staff, everyone seemed very professional and actually a bit rehearsed. I did feel a bit like a science project as on my first visit I had a ton of blood taken for testing and a transvaginal ultrasound and was scheduled for an HSG the next day. The HSG performed showed that both of my fallopian tubes were blocked. The results were given to me right after it was done as I was sitting in front of 4 strangers (not sure why 4 people needed to be in the room). I was obviously completely devastated and very little compassion was doled out. The worst part was I had come alone as I was told I could because it was a simple outpatient service. I will have to say the procedure was actually done very quickly and smoothly with no pain, which it is apparently rare not to have pain, which I would later learn. However it was the upsetting results and the massive amount of bleeding following the procedure that told me that I really should have had someone bring me. I had ridden the train for god sake! My main takeaway from this experience - do not go alone to an HSG! My husband and I were then told on our next visit that our absolute only chance of conception was IVF. I had mostly normal other results, but because I was 38 I should hurry into the process. We stayed for the IVF lecture that night. We were given a sales pitch that would make a used car salesman salivate. The words ""you get 5 doctors for the price of 1"" actually came out of the mouth of Dr. Butts. My husband and I left stunned with disbelief that creating life has come down to this type of commercialization.I looked into other options on my own and proceeded with many types of natural therapies. One good resource is natural-fertility-info.c…. I have integrated supplements, diet changes, acupuncture (Cara Frank is amazing), mayan massage (Jennifer Harrison is awesome), and a few other things into my life. I could feel the changes in my body and my period. This past February (1 year later) I scheduled another HSG with my gynecologist. This time it hurt unbelievably bad, but showed that both fallopian tubes were completely open! Even though I had done the work to get them open, I still had a hard time believing it. Now it has been a couple months and we are crossing our fingers and toes for a positive test result. I have complete respect for any path a person takes to parenthood, but I want to let people know that sometimes these fertility clinics do not have the best intentions or are just not informed of all ways possible for women to become mothers. Trust your intuition and make sure you feel completely comfortable with the course of action the doctor wants to take, otherwise you will be left with complete disappointment.",1
542,542,Penn Fertility Care,4 star rating,"I first would like to say that I mostly went to the 8th/ Walnut offices (except on holidays or weekends when I went to 3701 Market St).  I went for almost three years- multiple IUIs, and several losses.  In that time, I met almost every doctor, but as I was considered a patient of Dr. Edwards, it was he who I mostly saw (and he who followed up with me when necessary).  I felt like they were compassionate and empathetic, and their support staff was excellent.  Over all of my treatments, I got to know the women who did the ultrasounds, the blood draw staff, and the nurses. The blood draws were always painless at 8th/Walnut, and the nursing staff was professional and compassionate.  But the empathy and personal attention from Gloria, Brooke, and (I am so sorry that I don't recall her name) the other woman who were the ultrasound team at the 8th/Walnut group was amazing.  I will never forget Gloria holding my hand and crying with me when I had a loss.  I will always remember their cheers when I finally ""graduated"" with my successful pregnancy.  You can train people to do their jobs efficiently, but you cannot train people to be as loving and caring as those women were to me.  I loved how honest the doctors and nurses were- at some fertility practices, they are all ""sunshine and roses"", and while I appreciate that some people need a team that will tell them gentle lies to make them feel better, I needed a team who was going to be honest about my chances, and cut to the chase.  The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars, by the way, is because I didn't feel the same amount of professionalism at the Market St location.  Although, I really only went there on holidays and weekends, so they may have had a staff during the week who was also fabulous.  But I always waited for ages at the Market St location- including one day when I was completely forgotten about when I was there for a monitoring appointment.  But always, once I was seen, I was treated with professional courtesy.",4

We could almost never get in touch with a doctor or nurse when we wanted to, and the times we could were rushed off the phone. The receptionists were often rude, unintelligent and unhelpful.The final straw: A test showed that a Fallopian tube might have a blockage, meaning the the procedures we had done were quite possibly a complete waste of time, tears and money: and the doctor NEVER told me.

Some of them actually contain valuable points, now that I am a patient there myself.The overall level of service there is VERY uneven. At first, I gave the place the nickname ""Hot mess with a happy ending"". They will miscommunicate with each other. They will completely forget you are coming fro your initial appointment, and casually show up 45 minutes past scheduled time, having not reviewed your chart. They will occasionally give you a wrong dose of the med -- i.e. ""Stay on 450 units"", when your dose is actually 300 units, so PREPARE TO DOUBLECHECK their every step. With that, they are pleasant, their heart is in the right place, and their system is overall effective. Or so I thought when less than 24 hours before my last retrieval they told me they have no donor sperm prepared for me. That means, that my airhead nurse just did not bother to check until it was less than one day before the procedure, on a Sunday afternoon. Honestly, that was a bit too much to take. Again, in the very end, they found the sperm and did the procedure, but until the last minute, gowned up and with the IV in, I did know if the procedure is still happening. Prepare to a lot of stress and omissions. With that, they still achieve results, and are the closest group for Center City people geographically which becomes important when you do US and bloodwork every other day.

552,552,Penn Fertility Care,5 star rating,"We are very pleased with Penn Fertility.  We interviewed several fertility clinics and ultimately chose Penn and could not be happier that we did.  We are a same-sex couple that needed an egg donor and surrogate.  The third-party coordinator was amazing at helping us coordinate all of the moving pieces for our surrogacy journey, even when there were some kinks thrown in unexpectedly.  Dr. G was also a gem when helping us work through some less than typical situations that arose.  She made herself very available throughout the processes as we needed her.  That was incredibly appreciated during what is a very emotional process.  We ultimately had a successful pregnancy on the first try and had a baby within a year of our first visit to the clinic.  We cannot be happier and are over the moon with our little bundle of joy.  We plan on using Penn again to make him a big brother soon.",5
553,553,Penn Fertility Care,1 star rating,"My interaction with one of the doctora as this practive left me feeling dismissed and unvalued.  Whenever the discussion of IVF came up, and I informed this dr that it was not an option for me- he would shut down.  One comment was - well even if there is something we can fix, at your age, you just may not get pregnant..  During the next conversation his reply was - so you're just going to go with nature's course. Okay.  His bedside manner was unprofessional;  upon a pelvic exam, he never advised me of inserting the speculum , or his fingers.  When I told him i had to visit ER two days prior due to an unusual discharge, he first told me to stop taking the antibiotics, then told me to keep taking them, have intercourse that night, and call them to let them know if the issue persisted.  Other than thatm he said  I was fine, he was pretty sure I'd be fine, and to keep him posted.  Even though I am not prusing IVF, and I will believe that the practice is one of the best in the country, I would not recommend Dr. Sondheimer",1
554,554,Penn Fertility Care,1 star rating,"Absolutely horrible. The wait here is simply unprofessional and uncalled for.  My fiancé and I have been attending Penn Fertility for a year now.  We are already extremely distraught after experiencing miscarriages, and failed IUI's.  To deal with unpleasant receptionists, and then sit in rooms alone for 30-90mins waiting for a doctor or nurse is  incredibly frustrating. Especially when you have to do this multiple times in a week. If you can, avoid The center city location at all costs.  While the doctor (Dr.Butts) is very knowledgable, you will barely get to see her ever, and when you do, she will rush through the interaction and leave you with questions and concerns afterwards. You will be run through lengthy trials that are known to fail, before they finally prescribe correctly. And to top things off, if you are expecting results, you basically have to call/bug them.  This place is a complete waste of time. Avoid if possible.",1
555,555,Penn Fertility Care,1 star rating,"Penn fertility is absolutely terrible.  We went there for about 8 months and they barely ran any tests on me or my husband.  I only saw the doctor once or twice, usually it was the nurse, and the dr. didn't even call me after I had an HSG.  I asked to try fertility meds one month (they didn't recommend them or even mention them to me) and the nurse gave them to me without any explanation.  I felt completely alone and unmonitored.  They do not do blood tests or ultrasounds throughout the month.  Very little oversight.",1
556,556,Penn Fertility Care,1 star rating,"First, I should be clear that my experiences were almost exclusively at 3701 Market Street, not the other locations.  I did have one initial visit at Radnor, which is where I had wanted to do some of my care (and per their website, locations are interchangeable - yeah, right!).  Having come from another fertility practice where I saw a doctor during each visit, it was a shock to never see my doctor, a doctor, or my nurse during most visits.  While I could have been more comfortable with this arrangement if I felt that I had easy access to my nurse or doctor in other ways, I felt disconnected from my care and without power to ask simple questions and get feedback.  My doctor and nurse were fine, and if I was reviewing them, I would have given 3 1/2- 4 stars. But, since they really didn't have much sway in my regular visits with this office, I had to give 1 star.  Why?  The wait can be terrible - never less than 25 minutes and sometimes up to an hour.  Maybe this isn't a big deal for most doctor's offices, but for fertility testing that occurs every other day, you need to be able to get in and out quickly.  In most cases, I was only getting blood work done (that took less than 2 minutes).  At my previous clinic, I usually waited less than 10 mins and my worst wait in 4 months was 30 minutes (for which they were very apologetic).  Not at Penn Fertility.  You should wait and you better not ask questions. The other reason for my low rating is the receptionist.  I am a quiet, follower typer personality and I am happy to do what you tell me to, as long as I'm not being mistreated.  The main receptionist at 3701 Penn Fertility Care is one of the nastiest women I have ever met.  She barked at me almost every time I came.  It was a GREAT day when she was away from her desk or out of the office and someone else stepped in and possessed common courtesy.  While this may seem like a small thing, she is the guard dog for the office and it is nearly impossible to see or talk with anyone without getting past her.  She singlehandedly made my visits incredibly frustrating and unpleasant (which were already stressful b/c I was undergoing FERTILITY treatments - duh!).My insurance required that I go to Penn Fertility Care, so I had no choice.  If you have a choice, I suggest that you RUN to another practice!  (Try RMA)",1
557,557,Penn Fertility Care,5 star rating,"Penn Fertility Care has been knowledgeable, informative, and flexible with my husband and I as we navigated a very tricky fertility process. I'm in the middle of my treatments with them so am not pregnant yet, but I have never considered going anywhere else-- I don't get the sense that they are all about numbers, I think they care about individual patients and cases, and they try to develop a protocol that will work for you as an individual. They have also been individualized in their billing approaches-- they explain bills and ask you in person about them when you come in rather than just receiving a random disconnected bill. The doctors are all excellent-- we've gotten treatments during some very inclement weather meaning that doctors had to switch around schedules-- and they were always available for us. The nursing staff is the same way. My nurse communicates via text when I need to, and although I didn't realize that so much of the process would be done with nurses, it's very important that you feel comfortable with your nurse, which I do.",5
