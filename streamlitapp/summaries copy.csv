0,Columbia University,doctor,"Dr. Rudick is very professional and knowledgeable. She never pushed me to do something I was not ready to do, and let me set the pace of my treatments. When I decided to take a short break between cycles, she was very understanding. She is also very straight forward and matter-of fact with results and reasons for those results, and she doesn't sugar-coat, which I appreciated and which added to my trust of her. When I received bad news after a few cycles back to back, Dr. Rudick sent me a very nice email and I felt that we were  in this together, working toward a common goal. Although Dr. Rudick was not always available at every visit, all of the doctors and nurses at Columbia were pleasant to work with. Before and during each procedure, Dr. Rudick would explain each step in detail, which helped ease my anxiety. I felt very cared for by her and the team at Columbia.Dr. Forman listened to my concerns and is very good with first time IVF patients. Nothing was too small for his attention and he’s always doing his best for you. He consistently went above and beyond for me the entire time I was in his care. 

A perfect example of this was when I had expressed how much I wanted him to perform the actual IVF procedure rather than another doctor from the clinic. The day of the procedure, it wasn’t guaranteed that he could make it but he rushed to the clinic and made it happen. I actually teared up when I saw him. These things mean the world to women who have no control over their bad fortune.

There aren't enough words to describe how amazing Dr. Eric Forman is. He is kind, very compassionate, extremely knowledgable, great communication, and he handles all procedures with great attention and care. Dr. Forman goes above and beyond to provide quality care for his patients. He always addresses my question and concerns since our very first meeting. He explains all procedures in detail and makes sure you understand the pros and cons before it is done. He never forces any procedures on you, he suggests it, gives you all the information, and lets you decide if you want to take that approach. Because of the quality work and great advice from Dr. Forman, I now have a healthy baby boy.The level of contact and patience he had for me as a patient goes above and beyond any other doctor I’ve ever seen. From the moment we met, I felt totally comfortable and respected any decisions Dr. Forman suggested as my course of treatment. As a physician myself, I was impressed with both Dr. Brady's clinical knowledge and competence as well as her empathetic bedside manner. If there was a setback, she would break the news in a sensitive and empathetic way, but at the same time come up with solutions to address the set-back. I did not have Dr. Brady do the egg retrieval because of a conflict in my work schedule, but she did do the egg transfer. I was extremely nervous about the transfer because I ended up with only 1 genetically normal embryo after PGS screening, but I was impressed with how carefully and smoothly she preformed the transfer. The embryo ended up implanting, and I am now in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy!Dr Williams treats each patient like he was treating his wife or daughter. He is kind, patients and truly cares. He is easy to talk and one can tell that his mind is brilliant. He takes the time to call you with results even if it’s 10pm to help alleviate any happy/sad news. Dr. Forman clearly explained all options. He patiently answered our questions. He was available to answer follow-ups over email, and responded to those very quickly. He was compassionate at all of our visits. I was glad that he was able to do the egg retrieval.Dr. Rudick cares about her patients and she's honest with them, even when it's hard to be honest or to deliver news that is not what the patient wants to hear. There were periods of time when I was not in touch with her directly, but I   always knew that I   could email her or schedule a visit. I wish I could rate her on a scale having numbers way greater than 10. She is above any scale that can measure her professionalism, dedication, commitment, concern, care and love for her patients. She studies her patients in depth and personalize the treatment based on each individual as she does not consider her patients as a number but as a human, who needs special care and attention. She would never ignore even the slightest of issues you are facing while going through the treatment. 
Throughout the process, I emailed her quite frequently on very basic issues and she would always address them in a polite way and often, I would receive a call from her personally addressing the issue.
She makes the patients very comfortable, for example, I was having pain of injections and she resolved it in a very effective way.
She takes the patient along on what is best for the patient professionally and she guides the patient on each and every issue although I know that most clinics and doctors never go in such details.
We saw many fertility doctors for the last eleven years and went through many fertility treatments and emotional traumas and for most of the doctors, I was just a number and in time of failure, it was quite casual for them. However, Dr. Brady addresses very minute details like daily scans and readings quite seriously and would discuss with us. 
She is a very knowledgeable doctor and knows her work very well and then take her patients along that plan.Dr. McConnell is a good doctor -- she's knowledgeable, straight-forward and kind. She gets to know her patients and I felt like she was pulling for us the whole way. She was positive when we needed her to be, while also real about our concerns and drawbacks. Her communication wasn't always the best, regarding next steps and whatnot, but this might have also been because she expected her staff to be on top of this. I felt very comfortable in Dr. McConnell's care and always felt that I could go to her with questions. I would definitely recommend her.Again, I only saw her once and she responded to very few emails.  It is very difficult to accurately rate someone with whom I had minimal contact.  All follow-ups were handled by her team who were exceptional and the reason I stayed with Columbia Fertility.Dr. Grossman was a clear communicator, had a kind voice and face and really made us feel optimistic and safe in her care. She didn't always perform procedures but touched base with us. She was a great doctor and we were sad so see her go when she moved to California. My husband and I met Dr. K after our previous doctor at the practice moved to California. We liked our previous doctor and were a little apprehensive about have to switch doctors, after we had successfully produced 2 embryos with our other doctor. Dr. K was very clinical when we first met her. She went over and explained some of the lab results that the previous doctor had done, which he hadn't seen before. She appeared very knowledgeable and while we might not have completely understood everything she was talking about, she definitely knew what she was talking about and that made us feel secure. Once treatment started, Dr. K was much more personable and human. She was very much invested in my treatment. She answered my emails promptly and was there during the major events in the treatment. By the end of the treatment, Dr. K was a trusted ally. My mother even came to our last appointment to thank her in person for all her help.  Dr Brady is a confident doctor who immediately put us at ease. She is compassionate, clear and a great communicator. Her bedside manner is wonderful and always makes sure we are comfortable  with next steps before pursuing a treatment plan. She is optimistic but realistic which works well for my specific needs.  Dr. Karipcin is from Turkey and English is her second language. I was honestly biased at first and hesitant to try her. These were my own prejudices in my head, and once I was able to overcome that - I came to really appreciate and love her as my care provider. She made my husband and I laugh and never trivialized our process or journey (took up 4.5 years to get pregnant). She always respected our work / time constraints and never made us feel guilty about living very active and busy lives. Dr. K exuded confidence leading up to our transfer which definitely rubbed off on us! I believe it was Dr. Karipcin's positive and warm bedside manner that made our 3rd transfer more calm, positive, and successful than the previous two. Dr. Williams was exactly who we needed after an unsuccessful attempt at IVF with another clinic. Dr. Williams took more of a clinical approach with us and I did not feel like they were playing a numbers game or just going through the motions with us. We walked through our plan by steps. It was A to B. When we got to B we stopped assessed and moved to C. It was never a check the box feeling I had when working with this office. I also felt that Dr. Williams viewed my health as a priority. After my third miscarriage (2 natural, 1 IVF), another clinic said I should jump right into another cycle. I felt like something was missing and I needed to know that I was okay. Dr. Williams took a step back and ran test after test until we were comfortable with moving forward. I also felt that the office walked me through everything to make sure I understood the procedure. At another clinic I was told to watch youtube videos to figure out some stuff. It was just a different experience for me, and I feel lucky to have found Columbia when I did.I absolutely adore Dr. Brady. She is so thorough and thoughtful, always considering what more we can do to achieve a healthy pregnancy. She treats me as an intellectual equal and answers all my questions without ever rushing me or making me feel like my questions are silly. She was new to the clinic after my first round of IUI and I am so grateful to have switched to her care. I feel like she is fully invested in my case and always up to date on the latest research. Of all the doctors I have seen at the clinic, she is the most warm and personable. I seriously can't say enough about her. She is absolutely the best. Dr. Forman is very open about the treatment protocol. I underwent 3 transfers at a different clinic and neither resulted in pregnancy. I was frustrated and seeking advice from someone other then the doctor o was seeing who's only recommendation was to proceed with another embryo transfer w/o knowing why they kept failing. Dr. Forman was the only person I encountered who opened up other options for me.Dr Forman is very blunt. Not in a mean way, he certainly is very compassionate, but you can tell he is a man with an analytical mind. He never inflated probabilities and was always honest about what the chances for complication were. He is readily available by email and phone if needed. I always felt that we were dealing with a very smart man and that we were in good hands We didn’t know what to expect when we first decided to go to the fertility center. But honestly it all went so smooth and hustle free. I had no confusion I knew what to do next every step of the way. This was probably the most non-overwhelming doctor experience I ever had. After several months we had a successful IVF in the first try :) Every doctor we worked with was incredible but our favorite by far was Dr Brady. We are definitely coming back for baby #2 :) Dr Brady was incredibly knowledgeable, professional, supportive, compassionate, never judging and always sweet. She was always in touch and her entire team was on top of everything.  We were always updated the same day after our appointment. I didn't have to follow up or explain anything to anyone. It felt like everything was done for us.Dr. Rackow is very compassionate and is willing to discuss all the details of treatment with her patients. While I didn't get to see her as much during my second cycle she still communicated with me during the process. She adjusted the approach after an initially disappointing first retrieval, and we had a much better result. Dr. Forman is not only kind and compassionate, but also extremely knowledgeable and does not leave any details to mystery. At times, his explanations felt verbose and overwhelming but I suppose that is a natural feeling in this situation. He is happy to answer any and all questions and will repeat information as much as you need him to. He is very easy to contact. He always let me know when he will be away and responds to emails within a few hours. I saw Dr. Rudick for an initial consultation for future egg freezing as well as a full workup. I appreciated my one-on-one consultation with Dr. Rudick for her thoroughness and care in explaining the procedure and rationale to me. I felt that she didn't dilute or in any way gloss over any relevant information, which was important to me.When we first met Dr Mc Connell I was immediately at ease with her and felt in good hands because of her vast knowledge about her area of expertise. She answered all our questions and made sure to get every preliminary test done so that we could have all the information we needed to move forward. As we progressed through 3 IUIs she suggested the option to move towards IVF but I didn’t feel pressured by her at all. She gave us all the information we needed to make the big decision and was willing to work with anything we wanted to do. After two IVF cycles, I inquired about donor eggs as well and she gave me all the information about that process, even though we weren’t ready to take that step yet. Another thing I really appreciate about Dr McConnell is that she always goes out of her way to be the one to do my morning monitoring if she is in the office. It’s a big office and for monitoring I don’t always see her, but I appreciate that she looks out for me and is there when she can be. We have developed a nice relationship and we are able to joke and connect as people not just as doctor and patient. I trust her expertise completely and I feel very lucky that I found her on my first try with a doctor. I will say that I don’t particularly need a doctor who is gushingly warm so Dr McConnell is great for me. She is sensitive when needed but tends to be very matter-of-fact which I appreciate, but I mention here because some people really might want a more warm bedside manner. Dr. Rudick was absolutely amazing with my husband and I during this whole process! Ever since, I read her online Overview and saw her introduction video on the Columbia OB/GYN website, I knew that Dr. Rudick was the right doctor for me. I appreciated how she showed compassion for her patients and their experiences. 

I always appreciated how kind Dr. Rudick was, but mainly, she was incredibly knowledgeable and made me feel very confident about her work during my visits and treatments in the clinic. Dr. Rudick always educated both my husband and I during our visits at the facility and guided us during the whole process. 

Lastly, Dr. Rudick was always accessible for questions and concerns. She was very responsive to my emails, which was much appreciated when I wasn't feeling well or was experiencing symptoms from my treatment. I was very happy, and I am very thankful for Dr. Rudick's work. Dr. Forman takes time to evaluate and analyse each patient´s particular history and needs. He´s straightforward in a way in which you understand perfectly well what you are getting into and have realistic expectations of what´s to come. He explains every detail with patience and takes all the questions you want to ask. He´s very professional, serious, and gained our trust since day one. Dr. Forman is truly amazing. I had previous IVF treatments at 2 different clinics across NYC and went to Dr Forman after being suggested to go for an egg donor with my previous clinic. Dr Forman took a lot of time to read through my reports and understand our case. During our 1st visit, he told us that we are too young and early in our journey to give up and can try different protocols. 
I went through 2 IVF cycles with Dr Forman and he changed the protocol during each cycle to try something new so that it could give me a fresh chance to get more embryos due to poor egg quality. 
Even when we were undergoing our transfer process, he insisted we try a natural cycle transfer protocol instead of doing the usual medicated ones to see if it helps increase our chances. 
Dr Forman's communication is immaculate! I never had to wait for more than an hour to get his response via email. Dr. Forman was a kind and gentle man who was incredibly well informed, well trained and handled all communications and procedures with great attention and care. From our initial meeting to our most recent, he has taken the time to review all our concerns, teach us the necessary science and let us work through the options. I feel we were in charge of the decision(s) we made and always felt I was informed.She is very warm and smart. You gain a sense of co fidence and reassurance when speaking with her. I appreciated that she took her time to explain concepts and reviewed our concerns with us one by one. Dr Rudick is probably the nicest doctor I've met. She is not fake nice, she is just a genuinely nice person. She is also really smart and has taken her time with us during our one on one meetings. However when I see her for my sono's I don't get to ask her questions. That said, the doctors are super busy and its not so called meeting time. Things haven't really gone our way this time round, by this time round I mean that I have been able to conceive through this clinic once before. Our insurance was not great and it took forever for us to get our diagnostic stuff taken care of, it was also very confusing, we changed our insurance but apparently didn't tell billing in time, just told the front desk. One would think front desk would tell billing but that is not the case. This delayed our start date for treatment. We did way too many IUIs, couple of which we did because we were under the impression that the IVF lab was closed for the whole of Jan. And then we realized that we could have still kicked off a IVF cycle since the labs do open by the second half of the month. A lot of this information was hazy and unclear. I feel we've lost a lot of time because of a lot of factors, none of which are directly related to Dr Rudick. Dr. Forman is a genius! He is so calm and kind and was always honest with us but at the same time always gave us hope! He is very knowledgeable. We went to him after 3 chemical pregnancies. Dr. Forman suggested we try a “natural” transfer cycle, as my cycles are regular - and it worked!! No other doctor had ever suggested this. 
He is always available for questions and concerns and really treats you like a human being. 
Dr Rackow is extremely professional and has a very practical approach. She doesn’t sugar coat anything and can at times this can be viewed as a tad be rough around the edges but I actually liked it. It kept me grounded and I felt very informed about what to expect. During the time she saw me she was out of the office for personal reasons so my first two frozen transfers were done by other Drs in the office. My case was unique (as with most) but ultimately the Dr’s who handled my case identified what was the best course of treatment for a successful outcome. Dr. Brady was the kind of doctor that worked so hard for the positive outcome that she would change her own schedule around to make sure she was there for each milestone. She would reply to emails so quickly it blew my mind away! She was an absolute joy to work with and I would definitely go see her again for my second child. Dr. Grossman is kind, empathetic and always rooting for you. To more cynical personalities, this could seem inauthentic/fake, but it's not—she never wavers in her positive attitude, but is realistic and action-oriented in her care.Dr. Forman is great, very measured and thoughtful. He's definitely reserved meaning he's cautious about being overly positive OR negative and really takes things one at a time. I wouldn't say that he and I are besties, but I did feel incredibly well taken care of at every step of the way and never EVER felt pressured to move forward faster than I was ready he for. Instead, my experience of Dr. Forman is that he's incredibly thorough and takes his time, meaning that he really considers the options, tries different things, and lets you decide what you're ready for.I decided to freeze my eggs because I have a very busy professional life.  I was a bit scared of going through that process alone (without a partner) but Dr. Karipcin made it easier.  She was supportive, understanding, helpful with her medical opinions. I felt blessed for having her as my doctor.  She is the best and I was sad to see her go.  Her new patients will be very lucky to have her.  Dr Forman was amazing, he was realistic about the chances of conception through each step but also encouraging and supportive which kept us going during 2 rounds of IUI with negative pregnancy tests at the end of each. He thoroughly explained all the options and steps of all procedures. He made himself available by email which for me was my preferred method of communication and he responded extremely quickly to any questions I had. The egg retrieval and transfer went as smoothly as you could hope for, I couldn’t recommend him more.When we had our initial consultation, Dr. Williams carefully listened to us, paid attention to every detail, reviewed our medical records and explained to us that our initial diagnosis was wrong ! we had a few other medical professionals review our case in the past. He was the ""firs one"" to realize that we were off track and misled. Dr. Williams has a very out of the box open minded approach when diagnosing his patients. He has a brilliant mind and a kind heart. He analyzes a situation from every angle and possibility before customizing your treatment plan. He patiently addressed our concerns and answered all our questions in a clear sensible way. Although he is very realistic and careful not to promise, he gave us a sense of security and hope.From the minute we got to know Dr. Williams, we were delighted, because he showed us that he is here for us, and will be with us along the journey. Dr. Williams is very intelligent and always informed with the latest studies. His bright insight in every situation, gave us the feeling of trust. He knows each patient and follows up with them. Dr. Williams always explained our treatment thoroughly and set expectations for possible outcomes.  Although you can see that he has a brilliant mind, he was always patient with our many questions, offering insight into the hows and whys of each step.  But more than anything, he treated my husband and I like the family we were trying to become—like two parents for whom he would help find answers rather than two people who were trying and failing at making a family.  It’s a subtle difference but the effect is that we felt at all times that we had an ALLY rather than just a PHYSICIAN.  A Physician might tell you why you keep losing your keys.  An Ally helps you find them.  Dr. Williams never had an observation that he didn’t quickly follow with a plan and a “what questions do you have for me?”

I had to have two corrective surgeries and several other procedures in between to diagnose and correct my Asherman's—and through each one, he helped us maintain hope.  When we conceived our daughter (only 9 months after meeting Dr. Williams for the first time!) I’ll always remember how he congratulated us: “You’ve got some really exciting milestones ahead!’Although Dr. Williams is absolutely brilliant in his field of expertise, he is also extremely humble. He treats his patients with genuine empathy and a unique  sensitivity. At times, it almost felt as though Dr. Williams was being more sensitive to our emotional needs than we ourselves were being. We always felt that he was truly listening to us with his full attention. His kindness can also be seen in the way that he treats his staff - always introducing the nurses by name to the patient, and always talking to them in a respectful manner.Dr. Grossman as an individual is compassionate and friendly.  She also explained as much as she could when we saw her.  The issue was that we barely saw her for such an important event in our life.  I believe this is a negative consequence of the clinic and not her. When we left Dr. Forman's office, both my husband and I felt imbued with confidence that we were in good hands. He had taken the time to carefully review our medical history and data, and explained to us potential treatment paths with their advantages and disadvantages, concluding with the best option for our situation. All the while he was eager to hear our story, and provided us with ample opportunities to ask any questions we might have. He also gave us his e-mail address and answered any e-mail within 24 hours.She is knowledgeable and compassionate. I highly recommend her.  I mainly see her in the Westchester office, but I have been to the new Manhattan location as well and it's amazing!! I had an appointment with Dr. Forman once when Dr. McConnell was out of the office and he seemed great as well. The process of scheduling appointments is seamless, and I adore all of the nurses, secretaries, and phlebotomists I have interacted with.Dr.Rudick was welcoming which made me more comfortable since I had a bad experience from my first fertility doctor. She also asked me what I will like to do as far as treatment. She gave me all my options and broke them down to me. She also got a chance to talk with my husband who’s a trans man. She gave us insight on fertility in the LGBTQ community. She’s been nothing but amazing so far. Dr. Rudick impressed me early on as being both intelligent and attentive.  She is very thorough and very quick to get what’s on my mind. She made me feel positive and gave me confidence. I also appreciate her attention to detail and willingness to discuss matters openly. I am so proud to have him as my Doctor.  I was about to give up on CWRC after several failed procedures.  But I gave them another chance and met with Dr. Eric Forman.  I told him how I felt about CWRC. He assured me that things were going to change.  He spoke with confidence.  He took his time to explain everything.  And I really wanted to try having another baby and so I gave him a try.  And then, our journey began, 4 months later, I was pregnant! Dr. Forman made sure that I had all the medications I needed. He kept in touch with me through email and I was shocked that he responded so quickly. I had so many questions and he answered all of them. He was patient with me. He's just an amazing Doctor, not because I became pregnant, but because I didn't feel like just another patient. I didn't feel like I was passed down from one doctor to another. He is absolutely wonderful! CWRC is a large clinic and serves tons of patients at their Manhattan location. Dr McConnell works part of the week there, and spends the other days running the Scarsdale location.If it is at all possible for you to get to the Scarsdale location, I highly recommend it. I went out of my way to come to this location because the one in Manhattan is such a zoo. You will still have to go to the Manhattan location for procedures like IUI, egg retrieval, and embryo transfer. For those procedures you never know which Dr you’re going to get. But all of my morning monitoring was done by Dr. McConnell. She was always upbeat and personable and I never felt rushed, like I did woh other Drs in the practice.I only saw Nataki Douglas at my consultation and the appointment after all tests were complete to go over a treatment plan. I thoroughly enjoyed both these appointments. She took time to explain test results, treatment options, potential risks and it never felt rushed. She is very caring and her conversation didn't feel too stiff or clinical.Communication skills are poor. Next steps were spoken about in broad strokes. She dictated the next steps without asking for my input and paid little attention when we provided input/shared concerns. It always took a very long time for her to get back to us (by phone) - we resorted to carrying the phones with us into bathrooms etc. so as not to miss her calls.  There are far better and faster ways to communicate today e.g. emailI don't know if Dr. Rackow is really familiar with many of her patients' cases/treatment progress.  She was seldom available and I only managed to see her once.  Again, I feel that fertility treatment protocols are quite individualized and it is very hard for me, as a patient, to just see whomever is available that day and you can tell they just literally just flipped through your chart moments prior and are now going to decide the course of your treatment.  It might be okay with some people, but since I was paying fully out of pocket I was not going to take that gamble.Dr. McConnell seemed like a warm person and she was positive about the treatment she was prescribing for me. However, she was not proactive. After having 2 failed IUIs with no drugs, I had to call the clinic myself and ask whether I could start taking clomid. I never heard back from her after my failed IUIs or after my request to start taking clomid. The nurse called me back and said OK. How is that acceptable behavior for a doctor? After 3 IUIs failed, I simply never called the clinic again and Dr. McConnell never reached out to me. I can't adequately review her personally as a doctor as I only saw her once during my consultation.I think I spend more time reviewing Dr. Racow than she spend on my case.  When I had a follow up appointment she was searching through her computer data for the information about my case as she was unprepared.  

Most of the visit she was staring at the computer instead of giving us advises or talking about our case.  After unsuccessful treatments she wanted us to continue with the same treatment without adjusting anything. 

Getting questions answered while in a cycle was challenging. There was no email or phone for Dr. Rackow. I left only one message but it was not returned. It felt like you have no one to turn with your questions.  Dr. Guarnaccia is an excellent, thoughtful and sensitive physician. When I started my first cycle for the egg freezing, when I came in on day 6 for my first ultrasound with the doctor on call to see whether the follicles were maturing, the results were negative - and I was instructed by that doctor to stop the fertility shots. I was in tears and Dr. Guarnaccia so happened to be in the office that Saturday, and purposely went out of his way to find me to calm me down and explain that we are not robots--we are human beings and one regimen of shots that works for one patient does not necessarily work for another. He strongly urged me not to give up and encouraged me to do another cycle for the egg freezing and advised that we would do a different regiment of shots. I appreciated his feedback and ultimately agreed, and while that cycle did not get as many eggs as hoped, we did get through the whole cycle and froze six eggs. I was advised to do another cycle to maximize the number of eggs but my finances (and well-being) decided against it for the time being.  I had a horrible experience with Dr. McConnell. She regularly failed to explain procedures or recommendations and lied to me. Dr. McConnell said that one couldn't stop birth control pills mid-pack--apparently, it was easier to lie than share her reason for wanting me to continue the medication. She also made an error during an exam and said my uterus was retroverted; it's not and she had done ultrasounds on me previously. Most significantly, I went through with a surgery that Dr. McConnell recommended for me, and unfortunately she failed to mention that it could have a significant negative impact on my ovarian reserve. She also did not help get me an appointment with a surgeon. He was kind, intelligent,  and informative- particularly at the initial consult. However, as time went by I found it more and more difficult as I rarely saw him when at the clinic and had an extremely difficult time reaching him by phone and he never seemed to remember who I was or the details of my case/treatment. On one occasion he forgot to include his DEA number on my prescription causing me to waste extra time as I had to return to the clinic to get a new prescription. 
And ultimately I felt he just followed a ""one size fits all"" approach.  I lost my first pregnancy (due to a chromosomal abnormality) which was the result of my second natural cycle IUI (no medication). Despite this, Dr. Zimmermann strongly advised that I take Clomid for any subsequent IUIs. I followed his advice once however, the Clomid caused significant discomfort and did not result in a pregnancy. I then got a second opinion from another reproductive endocrinologist who indicated that would not have been his recommendation due to some adverse effects of Clomid and due to the fact that I had already gotten pregnant with a natural cycle, had no known documented fertility problems and good ovarian reserve. Against Dr. Zimmermann's advice, I decided to go back to a natural cycle (no Clomid) on my next try which resulted in a healthy pregnancy. I really only saw her twice I think. The first visit was the initial intake. As previously mentioned, she seemed to briefly scan my paperwork and misinterpreted a letter. I had to keep correcting her. She was nice and all but she also didn't really care to diagnose me properly since ""whatever it is, we'll be treating it the same way"".Another cog in the CWRC machine with zero personal knowledge of our case or any real motivation to pull off a successful pregnancy. 

To give an idea for how bad it was - here is our last visit's description (at which time we decided we are never setting foot again in CWRC)

- we had completed 6 IUI cycles by then, with no adjustments made to our medication or plan (we constantly got only one follicle with each clomid cycle)

- We setup time with her to figure out if we should move on to IUI.

- She spent a good 15 minutes telling us curtly that we should have caught a billing/insurance screw-up that had happened with a blood test earlier in the day (nurse made a mistake with some code, we didn't catch it). 

- She then proceeded to spend another 10 minutes searching cluelessly through our records and complaining that someone had not organized the records properly.

- when we asked for her opinion on whether we should do ICSI and whether we should do PGS with our IVF cycle and she point blank refused to answer, saying it was a decision we should make (we only asked for her expert opinion)

- the consult ended at that and we didnt step foot in CWRC after.See previous comment. She is direct, stays neutral, is forthcoming, fresh, progressive, supportive, takes her time and talks to you, feels like a friend, routes for you.  She recommend that I deliver ya NYC Langone due to my location and because they are an educational hospital I was not happy overall with Dr. McConell or Columbia U.  

There were several steps we had to go through in order to do IVF, and we were not told about all of the steps up front and so it took longer to begin IVF treatment which was stressful.  There was a long wait in order to enroll in the IVF class.  It turned out my estrogen priming would begin around the time of the start date of my IVF class and when I asked Dr. McConnell for instructions she refused to give them to me and suggested that I wait another month to start.

While Dr. McConnell was sometimes in a good mood I also found her to be moody and sometimes curt to me when I asked questions at consultation appointments.
He was very experienced and took the time to explain the next steps and answer questions. He was not judgmental and very encouraging. Whenever I left a message he responded in a timely matter. Although he didn't perform my procedures he did make sure to walk me through every step and process before it occurred.After going to other RE's I can honestly say that I have never been to such a terrible doctors office. It felt more like a factory or meat market then a doctors office. I was treated as a number and received a pager that would beep with instructions when it was my turn to pay or see the doctor. It is the same kind of pager that they had at my local fast food restaurant.  

No one bothered to learn my name and there was very little follow through on the part of the doctors. I saw a different doctor each time I came and they were not familiar with my case. Most of the time it took them multiple days to get back to me and the nurses were the only ones to call even when a specific request was placed to speak directly with Dr. Sauer. Other than my first consultation I never spoke or heard from Dr. Sauer until I complained and told them that I was leaving to another RE. 

I only stayed with them for 3 cycles 1 medicated colmid and two clomid IUIs. After my first clomid IUI cycle I expressed concern to the doctor I saw at morning monitoring about my heightened side effects that I was experiencing. She brushed me off and asked if I wanted to have a baby or not. And there was no follow through or attempt to switch my medication to other stimulants.  
Dr. Rudick was simply not a good doctor and she was terrible at explaining issues.  After the first round of bloodtests I had, she left me a voice mail telling me it would be hard for me to get pregnant.  She later denied saying that on the message, and said I had not understood her, but I listened to the message several times and it is what she said.  It may not have been what she meant, but that does not help on a voice mail, especially when you cannot reach her easily with follow up questions.  

Second, her treatment was not good.  When I went to another doctor for a second opinion, I found out she had missed several things in my chart.  The second doctor picked up on several results from Ruduck's chart and made changes in my treatment, which got results.  Dr. Rudick had the same information but didn't use it.

Dr. Rudick was was pregnant when I saw her but she never said anything.  It wasn't obvions when I started seeing her but she walked into one appointment clearly showing and I was floored.  I felt it was very insensitive of her not to say anything about her pregnancy earlier (or at all).    When I asked her when she was due she refused to tell me.  She is a nice woman and a smart doctor.  I appreciated that her first reaction was not to send us right into IVF.  If she had said ""I think you need IVF"" we would have listened to her, but she felt we should try IUI first and it was the right course of treatment for us.  After my miscarriages, she made sure I got all of the appropriate testing to make sure everything was okay.  That being said, she's not the warmest person in the world, so if you need a doctor who will hug you, she's not it.  She does listen.  She does answer questions.  I never felt talked down to.We did 2 IVFs and several IUIs with Dr. Rackow. One IVF was a complete failure, the other resulted in two frozen embryos that are still at CWRC. Shortly after leaving Dr. Rackow and CWRC, we successfully conceived. The issue with CWRC is that they don't test for everything, and don't communicate what they don't test for. In fact, the issues that were inhibiting our fertility were easily solvable, but during our time with Dr. Rackow and the CWRC, every failure was addressed with statistical charts (eg. You are at ""X"" age, therefore your IVF success % is ""Y""). We were told they had tested for everything. They hadn't. We wasted three years and tens of thousands of dollars at this practice. Ultimately, CWRC are proceduralists.. They are not diagnosticians. When we returned to CWRC after having our child, we recapped the ultimate diagnosis of our fertility challenge and the response we got (from a different doctor there) was simply ""We don't test for that"". Well, thanks for telling us you had tested for everything.Dr. Lobo was very knowledgeable and matter-of-fact. He told me what he recommended and set a plan in motion, and was kind but I did feel like I was one in about a million patients. My individual success didn't seem super important. Or the emotional aspect of fertility treatments. Dr. Guarnaccia was more concerned with maintaining the center's statistics then relating to us as human beings. He was cavalier and made light of what was a very serious issue to us. He made us feel as if he were doing us a favor gracing us with his presence.  We were matched with him by the Center because we were diagnosed with secondary infertility and the person scheduling appointments at that time said she thought that he would be a good match. He barely looked us in the eye when he spoke with us. We tried to see other doctors in the practice as much as possible because we really did not think Dr. Guarnaccia had our best interests in mind when recommending treatment options - but was rather just concerned with stats of the Center. He does not email patients.  Will only call you when you request a call.  
Unfortunately, I miscarried the only embryo I had left and its happening during Covid.  He was not helpful or comforting to help me make decisions about a D&C.  In fact, he said one thing and the nurse said the other.  I am now communicating with the head of the practice.  I am disappointed that he didn't go the extra mile to make sure My next steps were squared away.Dr. Forman went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable every step of the way. His good-natured demeanor was always reassuring. He is incredibly passionate and curious. Whenever we brought up a question or idea he was able to cite the most up-to-date research (some of which he had helped develop!). I cannot say enough about how great Dr. Forman and the staff of Columbia University Fertility is! I am not local to NYC but have had prior experience with Dr. Forman and so I wanted to work with him again, regardless of location. His bedside manner is incredible and calming. He is brilliant in my book. Staff is incredibly kind and knowledgeable. Results and emails are answered in a timely manner. Wait time in waiting rooms is minimal, if at all. I am so grateful to Dr. Forman and CUF for some many reasons! Since I had visited two previous doctors I was a little discouraged when I went in for the initial consultation with Dr. Rudick but once we sat down and I explained all my past treatments to her everything changed. Dr. Rudick showed she cared, she explained every step to take and gave me back my hopes. She was super informative during the consultation. She had a great bedside manner. I didn't like that there was no follow up from her after each on of my IUI's. No firther review as I only sat with her once, and she only did one out of three IUI's.She’s very knowledgeable and compassionate considering how many patients are under her care. I like her personality and that she’s always there to answers all of our questions which we had many. My previous doctor was impossible to communicate with and I love that I can just email Dr. Rudick with any question I have. This definitely have reduced my anxiety in this process. As a patient I really appreciated Dr. McConnell and her approach to my care, she repeatedly took the time to explain and always followed up with the outcome was not as anticipated. Her ability to humanize with her patients is something I really appreciated.From day one, Dr Brady made me feel comfortable and took the time to answer all my questions. She provided my husband and I with all the details needed regarding the IVF process and also coordinated with my thyroid doctor to provide the best treatment plan. 
He is really thorough, knowledgeable and really great at what he does.  He is not the most personable Dr I have met, but that is not an issue for us.  I do wish he was the one to have performed more of my Check-ups and procedures or at least informed us he would not be doing them. Dr. Stahl is a young, well-educated, energetic and straightforward doctor. It was awkward having to see a Urologist, but he completed his tests and surgery with the most respect possible. I didn't enjoy having to be poked and prodded, but it was well worth it with the potential end result of increased sperm quality.She is very knowledgeable and compassionate. She hears my concerns and makes me feel comfortable by explaining the plan and why she has chosen that specific plan for my partner and me. Though we haven’t see. Her for many cycles, she has proven that she is invested in our future pregnancy. She is very smart. She has a calming manner that right away relaxes you. She can be straightforward and tell you what you need to hear. She mentioned losing weight would be helpful. Dr. Brady goes through every detail with you. When you leave a visit you feel like all your questions were answered. She didnt give us false hope but she was encouraging. She has a lot of patience. I had a million questions and she never made me feel like I was taking too much of her time. Dr. Rudick is responsive, patient, and caring while maintaining strong boundaries. She is extremely knowledgeable, and makes sure to explain very complicated medical treatments and issues before you even ask her to. Dr. Forman was always very professional, while still showing compassion. He explained every step of the way including potential setbacks and risks as well as current research findings. Any question we had along the way he addressed right away by email. For the egg retrieval Dr. Forman came in to the office to perform the procedure himself, even though it was his day off.Fertility treatment is tough. It requires a lot of discipline, patience, courage and trust.  Dr. Forman is a smart, kind, compassionate and committed doctor you can count on which is absolutely priceless and what helps you keep going until you get the result you are looking for. He is quiet and unassuming but goes above and beyond what you can expect from a doctor.Dr. Williams is careful and compassionate, and took time and care to tailor a treatment plan.  He was available to talk when requested, and was able to explain all options to help us make decisions.  he also addressed possible causes of my partners infertility as well as mine.
I am very happy with her. She has been very informative and has been great to adapt my cycle when we needed to. I feel very confident that she will be the one to help me get pregnant. I'm very glad she is my doctor. I feel comfortable with her.Dr. Choi is amazing. Her medical knowledge is very in-depth and current. Her demeanor, despite the pressure of her stressful days, always pleasant. I was her patient for several years and  I always felt well cared for,  listened to and kept informed. No ball dropped ever. She was always aware of every detail of my current cycle.I cannot say enough how lucky I feel to have found Dr Forman. We switched clinics (adding 1-2 hours to our commute)  because I had read such great reviwes of Dr Forman and our high expectations were completely exceeded. Dr Forman was extremely accessible - I emailed and called him frequently with long lists of questions and he always responded thoroughly and extremely quickly. I have never before had a dr who will email directly with a patient, and Dr Forman did so regularly. My husband and I felt very confident for the first time in our journey to be parents that we had a doctor who cared about us and was giving our case very individualized care. He recommended testing that a previous doctor had not and discovered new aspects for our care.  I cannot recommend Dr Forman enough -  not only was I MUCH more calm during this IVF process with him than I was at our previous clinic due to  his communication and patience, but we also had success with him and are currently (very early on) pregnant! The bottom line for me is ultimately results, and we had a successful IVF pregnancy in one cycle. We're into the third trimester and knock on wood everything has gone very well. We always felt like Dr Zimmerman was highly competent, and have nothing but positive things to say about him as a doctor. The doctor seemed fine, but I didn't see her much during the fertility testing phase. She wasn't really that involved in my care, but I thought she was clear and confident in my conversations with her.He comes off as very arrogant and aloof.  When asking me questions about past experiences he scoffed at what I had tried to do to get pregnant like he was a miracle worker.Dr. Thornton was knowledgeable, calm, compassionate, patient, and flexible.  My husband and I felt like we were under so much pressure (as I know so many couples do) and this certainly aided in our struggles.  One month we couldn't go through with IUI and Dr. Thornton sat down with us and calmly talked us, through.  On the month that we conceived, due to pressure, our sample wasn't strong and Dr. Thornton was flexible and allowed us to come in the next day for a back to back IUI.  That cycle we conceived our son.Dr. McConnell has a great vibe. Calm and collected, she always took her time with us and answered all questions without rushing us. She has a great sense of humor as well.

I was very happy with my treatment as we got our son from our first ivf. However, we ran into sole trouble for the second round, and in hindsight I wished that we had some things a little differently. I felt that she was willing to listen to me but just wanted to do the same dose over and over again.Dr Choi was very compassionate with us and encouraged us to continue with treatments when we were in doubt. She sent us for an immunological workup on a hunch and it was due to the addition of those treatments that we had successful pregnancies. I always felt that I could trust her and that she had our best interests at heart. She made us fell like she would fight her hardest to make sure we had a baby.Dr. Choi made very basic recommendations for my case and did not conduct a particularly thorough analysis of my fertility situation from the beginning. For example, she never raised the possibility of endometriosis or blood clotting issues, two conditions my next doctor diagnosed very early on. He was honest and forthright.  I had seen other doctors before and his manner was much softer and gentler.   As the leader of the practice, he set the tone.  There was no ""wall of shame"" to look at.   There was no cattle herding.  There were no awful voicemails left.   People talked to you gently and with respect.  She has really good bedside manners. She is always supportive and will give you complete time and will listen to all your concerns and provides you with adequate responses. She is always very patient and lets you take the time to decide on the course of the treatment and adjust to the changes. Being under Dr. Brady’ care was like dealing with trusted family. Always professional, and very caring; which was so refreshing given the circumstances. I am sincerely thankful for her, for her knowledge, and for taking such great care of me & my family. Dr Brady made me feel comfortable, and took time to answer all my questions. She made a plan specific to me, and talked me through what to expect, and answered my emails quickly, as did her nurse. She took time to update me during testing visits when I saw her.During visits, regardless of type, he made me feel at ease. He also was able to relate what was going on in terms I could understand, so I didn't feel ""in the dark"" about anything going on. Although I did not conceive from the one cycle of IUI I did under his care, I felt confident in his knowledge and his abilities. I felt cared for and I was not disappointed when I did not conceive--because of his candid and caring nature.Dr Forman is quick to respond on email - even after hours or on weekends. He’s very comforting and yet honest. I trust him implicitly. He  has been very thorough describing every step of the process and reached out personally when our first retrieval didn’t go as hoped.Dr. Forman is amazing. I have a lot of anxiety around fertility and Dr. Forman was extremely patient with me every step of the way. Even now that I moved, I still will email Dr. Forman questions that I have because I really trust him. He answers my emails right away and makes me feel like I am his only patient while I know he has many. I have never written a review for anyone before but really felt like I needed to now. I cannot recommend Dr. Forman enough. Dr. Rudick is a good doctor. I felt completely comfortable with her.  She was very thorough with explaining The procedure, and answered any questions that I had. She can be very direct at times, but I felt that she just wanted to make sure that we were on the same page with everything. I would definitely go back to her when the time is right. Dr Douglas is a very thorough doctor. She was very clear about the journey we were about to undertake and explained it clearly. There weren't any surprises. I also liked the fact that she took out the time to answer questions whenever I saw her for a sono. Her self assuredness helped me feel that we were in good hands. That said we did two IUI's with her and were able to conceive. I am not sure how it would have worked out if things had dragged on longer. He has 20+ years of experience, but for such a sensitive topic, he really had no empathy.  I felt like I was being reprimanded during one of my visits.  I was 43 when my son was born so clearly on the high end as far as age. Re McConnell didn't give me false hope but she made judgements based on the specifics she saw with my treatment rather than simply based on my age. I was able to get a good number of eggs which increased my chances of a pregnancy. She was not frustrated by the fact that I got a second and third opinion and she was open to my suggestions. For example, she did a 5 day transfer with my first IVF and I didn't get pregnant. She was open to trying a 3 day transfer with my second IVF (resulting in may son.) Dr. Rackow is thorough, honest, focused, empathic, matter of fact and to the point but considerate. She listened to all of my concerns, didn't dismiss me, explained things very well to my husband and I, and allowed us to start the process with the least invasive procedure. (Which, knowing what I know now, would skip if I had to do it over.) She was responsive to my needs and was encouraging. She was very upfront about what might and might not work best. She recognized that I was laser focused about this whole process and was okay with that. I grew to love her so much that I was sad to have to leave her for a regular OB when I became pregnant after IVF. But I was ecstatic that I was pregnant!We both had a good feeling about Dr. Lobo when we started our treatment. Little did we know we would never see him again after our first meeting and had to deal with different doctors on every next appointment. Because it wasn't our first time to the rodeo and we knew what to expect and what was going on. The treatment was very ""factory""-like and it felt like we were pushed through the machine with very little consideration for the psychological impact of the treatment or questions that we had along the way.I had a wonderful experience with Dr. Choi.  She was very thorough in explaining different options to me.  I ended up going through 3 cycles of clomid and 2 cycles of IUI.  Dr. Choi did one of the IUIs and it was quick and easy (about 30 seconds). I think Dr. Lobo is a great doctor. I feel confident that he knows what he is doing, is aware of the latest research, and is at the top of the field. His bedside manner could be better, and sometimes I would appreciate more information about the next steps, but I know that I'm receiving excellent medical treatment.   He is very kind and smart. He explains everything step by step and what the risks are. He spends time with you until you feel comfortable with what is next. He gets back to you with answers to questions and makes sure you are comfortable with decisions moving forward.My only hesitation to give a 10 out of 10 is I'd prefer more information. It sometimes felt that Dr. Rudick was making the decision she thought was best without explaining why. I also would have liked more analysis and intervention sooner when things were not working. If transfers are not resulting in pregnancy, there is a bigger issue at play than just a same sex couple. He is quietly perfect. Educates you, empowers you and makes you feel in control. He makes both my husband and I feel safe and secure. We just adore him and the whole team. We feel like our fertility journey is safe in his hands and it's just wonderful to know he is our ""quarterback.""She is straight to the point and give you the facts. There is no doubt that she knows her job and is excellent at it. I would have just to show some compassion.  This is a very hard process and jus wanted to feel more at ease.  She is positive, upbeat and honest. I had great results from my retrieval (22 eggs) and I believe it had to do with how she handled my care. Totally stress free. Monitoring appointments can be stressful, but I always looked forward to seeing her. When we saw the baby's heartbeat for the first time, I could tell she was just as excited as we were. She was like part of our family and very much a part of our journey. Dr. McConnell treated us with the professional care we sought after having failed pregnancies at two different clinics over the course of five years.  We knew we were in good hands from the beginning.  After going through our history and conducting workups, she told us matter-of-factly that she could help us achieve our goal.  And she did.He's a nice guy, but he seemed too busy to be hands on with patients at the time. I was excited when I learned that I would be working with the director of Columbia, but I later learned that some of the other doctors were much better and much more compassionate. Was like family.  Trusted her with everything.  She was very understanding of our situation.  She didn’t make my wife and I feel uncomfortable.   We used known donor sperm and she was very compassionate.  She told us risks and concerns and truly was sensitive when the not so good happened.  Ultimately in 2017 we had our miracle baby Dr Choi is really compassionate and explains things in a way that is easy to understand. She has a nice bedside manner but is straightforward and to the point. The doctor was nice but didn't get much contact with her. I had the chance to meet her for the initial but that was all the only other time I saw her was passing in the hall and of course she didn't recognize me .I had 6 fresh rounds and after the 1st round didn't stick (1 5day embryo at transfer) We decided to batch as many embryos as possible. Every round was very similar 4-8 eggs retreived with one embryo making it to a 5 day blast. One time no eggs made it. so we had 4 embryos that all all came back with genetic problems through PGS. I felt that nothing was changed in my IVF cycles and they just tried the same thing over and over. I wish they made an effort to change my meds or something. He is excellent. I got very lucky but he is just so even handed and fantastic. I had nothing g to complain about. This clinic is rotational so you see whoever is on duty and all the doctors are excellent. Dr. Lobo had explained that ahead of time and asked me if I was ok with it the first time I met him. He sets the path , the others follow and do the procedure. He would still answer all my questions and help decide a treatment path. She was fantastic. Super smart, compassionate. Was only person who mentioned that part of my fertility problem may be related to a genetic defect - and recommended testing. She was right! Knowledgable about acupuncture and efficacy of supplements. In the end didn't need to go through with IVF as her recommendations for supplements worked. Highly recommend.Dr lobo was great , but the rest of his practice not so good. I was disappointment he didn't perform the iui as planned. I saw a different doc each visit and I feel the other docs mistimed the procedureShe is smart and will be honest with you as well as kind. She is up to date with the current research in her field. I feel safe in her hands.She knew what tests to run and was then able to help me get pregnant twice. Although they ended in miscarriages, she knows the next steps to take to ensure my next pregnancy is healthy. We saw several REs for the infertility diagnosis and liked Dr. Rudick the best by far. We are now seeking a 2nd opinion on treatment. If we hadn't liked her so much, we might have sought a 2nd opinion earlier. It's hard to be critical of doctor for being too nice. Dr Rachel McConnell is very caring. She makes you feel comfortable that she is choosing the right course of treatment for you.   She is very gentle, All procedures she did were painless. She goes above and beyond. Briana is very knowledgeable and kind. She completely understands my nervousness and guides me through absolutely everything. I am extremely nervous every time I go for a visit. She relaxes me before beginning any procedure.   Absolutely lovely
She always made us feel welcome and comfortable while explaining the procedures that lay ahead of us. The only drawback was the amount of time it takes to get an appointment, she has a waiting list of 1-2 months for an appointment.Each session with Dr. Choi was informative, helpful, and reassuring. The only downside was that the practice was busy, and I wasn't always treated by Dr. Choi. But I definitely preferred treatments with her over the other doctors. He is excellent. He is knowledgeable and understood my needs and urgency but did not try to push the most expensive treatments first. He explained that it is a group practice and I would see others and not just him. I don't have enough words to express my gratitude for Dr. Eric Forman and his staff at Columbia University Fertility under his lead.  The staff is very kind, welcoming and very professional.  From the receptionist to the doctors, nurses and all the way to the last person in the Lab you will encounter only wonderful people.  It is like God had handpicked this team.  As for the Dr. Forman, well... he is definitely a godsend!  He is the kindest doctor you will ever meet.  What makes him special - apart from his experience and knowledge in the field along with his high successful fertility rate, is his availability and willingness to kindly answer all your questions (good, bad or just silly) thru all channels possible (email, phones, sms, face-to-face, etc.).  Dr. Forman made both my husband and I feel safe, secure and in good hands.  Dr. Forman and his staff are so friendly they felt like extended family.  During our vacation overseas, Dr. Forman kept monitoring my test results over there and was in constant contact with us, day and night, even though there was a big time difference.  Prior to coming to Columbia University Fertility center, I tried two clinics before.  However, out of all, I recommend you Columbia Fertility center and Dr. Forman from all my heart!  Have faith and go meet Dr. Forman at Columbia Fertility!Dr. McConnell spoke clearly and was upfront with the process and what we were to expect. She monitored my treatment plan closely and did a successful embryo transfer. The Columbia staff was amazing in her absence. Dr. Forman, explained the options of my fertility success and above all, he was straightforward and gave me a good plan forward. 
I also like that he took the time to go over my history chart and explained some of the medications that I need to adjust for me to be ready to start the treatments. I gave him a timeline and we agreed on the steps that I need to take. I had a great experience with Dr. Rudick. She was straightforward, yet very kind and understanding. She has a calming presence and I enjoyed our long discussions on my course of treatment. I am in the mdidle of treatment, which is on hold now due to COVID-19. She held a virtual appointment for me and my partner to set our plan of action which made me feel very hopeful. Dr. Rudick was everything I wished a doctor to be: very professional and prepared, caring and compassionate; she always explained what was going on and supported me when I needed it. She was always very open in terms of the benefits and risks of every passage we were going through, and kept being positive during the difficult times. She is simply an amazing doctor!Dr. Rudick and her team, nurse Melissa, gave me quality care and consultation. She helped me through a miscarriage and now a new pregnancy. I have recommended her to everyone for her honesty, clarity, and compassion.Dr Brady has an excellent bedside manner, and seemed committed to my process and experience. She responded to my questions quickly (usually by email which is more convenient for me due to work). I always felt well taken care of.Dr. Rudick is kind, compassionate, and very smart.  On our initial consultation, she took the time to listen carefully to my history, and developed a treatment plan based on my desires as a patient.  I was interested in lowest intervention first, and she completely supported that.  She did a great job of explaining everything to my husband and I, and helping us to feel informed.  

I did not see her much during monitoring, but she was responsive via email and typically answered (or had a nurse call me) within 24 hours of any emails.

She was always positive when we interacted and always had a good plan for us.  When I did become pregnant, her happiness and excitement for us was genuine.  She helped me through my first few weeks of pregnancy, and was able to guide me before I switched over to an OB.As a patient of Dr. Forman, I've felt that we're in this together and that he wants the best possible outcome for me and my husband. From the very first meeting where we never once felt rushed, he explained all of our options. And when we needed to change our approach, he didn't force it upon us but rather allowed us to come to the decision on our own as this is a very personal process and often times there isn't just one way to proceed. I never doubt he has our best interests at heart and that, along with his priceless communication skills, gives us peace of mind that we're in the right place with the right doctor. She is knowledgeable and answered any questions or concerns that my husband I had during treatments. Even though some of the procedures were performed by other doctors, Dr. Brady ensured that I was in good hands and followed up with me after each procedure. I was extremely nervous on the day of the egg retrieval and it meant a lot to me that Dr. Brady stopped by the procedure room to make sure that I was fine even though the procedure was assigned to the other doctor.Dr. Brady had a very good bed side manner, she always took time to explain things to me and put my worries at ease.  Infertility is not so black and white, so while doctors cant tell you exactly how things will turn out, she was always optimistic, which helped me stay optimistic.  She was always quick to answer my questions.  I had no idea what to expect when I started IVF.  I had people tell me I had to travel to other states with the best stats in order to get the results I wanted.  Paula Brady was the first fertility doctor I saw and when we sat down for our initial visit, I immediately felt confident that we were in great hands.  She is so caring and extremely intelligent and up to date with all the latest fertility info.  It is so obvious she loves what she does and that absolutely reflects in her wonderful bedside manner and dedication towards her patients. Doctor Brady was great. From the first visit to the follow-ups, I felt as though she was incredibly knowledgeable and data-driven. Her responses often started with ""recent research suggests..."" or ""based on multiple studies""....things like that. For me, this was really helpful because it showed she knew a lot and also kept up-to-date on the latest information out there. The clinic I went to at Columbia had rotating doctors, but I thought it was so caring that she was specifically there for my first ultrasound and my last one where I ""graduated"" to a regular OB. I also thought she was always great via email, which was my preferred communication when not in the office. I also shared with her that my friends/family made comments that I was maybe too stressed or not eating right (even though I am generally pretty healthy) and she was quick to dismiss those comments and assure me that I was fine. I needed that sort of support at the time.Dr. Brady was very matter of fact and straightforward but had a great bedside manner once we reached the stage of doing the procedures.  I always felt like I was in good hands with her. She's very intelligent and caring and kindly answered every question I had in a very prompt manner. Dr. Brady is a doctor that genuinely cares and is passionate about what she does. Coming from a different clinic where I felt like a number on a conveyor belt being shuffled around, I felt a sense of calm and trust as soon as I met Dr. Brady. She took the time to listen to my concerns and provided me with innovative approaches that were not offered to me in the first clinic I went to. Dr. Brady's calming and caring personality combined with her up-to-date knowledge and innovative approaches truly set her apart. I strongly feel that being under her care and feeling that trust was a key factor in successful treatment. My experience as Dr. Williams' patient couldn't have been better. He gave me the attention I needed and was my advocate through a complex maze of infertility exploration, diagnosis, treatment and surgery. I needed surgery for uterine fibroids and he identified that as the cause of two early losses. He then recommended surgery by other surgeons through Columbia and made sure I got the absolute best surgeons to do three complicated surgeries that had great results. Dr. Williams acted as my advocate and made sure surgeons that he recommended were top notch and were giving my case the attention that it deserved. When navigating fertility treatment in the NYC, I think advocacy from your primary fertility specialist is an incredible asset. I had that in Dr. Williams. His knowledge of treatments and early miscarriage loss seems to be really unparalleled and I felt very very comfortable with him in my corner that I would end up where I needed to be. I eventually did end up pregnant without an early loss within one year of starting treatment with Dr. Williams. Dr. Williams was essential in diagnosing the problem, getting me the surgeries I needed from the right surgeons, and making sure it was safe for me to try to conceive again without a continued or increased risk of a third loss. He was just fantastic and I can't recommend him enough.Dr. Brady is an amazingly bright doctor who always keeps her patient's interests/desires in mind.  She strives to keep her patients informed and always responds very promptly to any questions that I had throughout this wild IVF process.  If Dr. Brady is unable to respond she ensures her nurse communicators or other staff relay important information in a timely manner.  She is so encouraging and uplifting which are essential qualities when dealing with the ups and downs of infertility.  She makes her patients feel confident that every choice she is making is the right one because she is so savvy about the world of infertility.Dr Grossman-Becht is polite and profession which for me allows me to feel comfortable to ask questions. She makes effort to explain procedures as well as test results. She is a practical but positive MD. She covers all the possibilities of my care including alternative treatment if the current treatment fails.
She takes my personal account of how I think my body functions(eg. Left /right side ovulation on any given month based on my experience throughout my teen to adult years) without being dismissive.Dr. Forman is the best doctor I've had across the board and has elevated my standards for medical care. Never before had I met a doctor who emailed me back (from his direct email, not through some labyrinthine portal system run by a staff person) always within the day, often within the hour, and sometimes within minutes! He made it a priority to do my transfer himself and did two of my three retrievals; for the one retrieval he couldn't do, he called me the night before to go over what to expect and check if I had any questions. When my first retrieval didn't yield the desired results, he spent an hour on the phone with me to review what had happened and discuss protocol shifts. He validated my frustration but also left me feeling hopeful and, sure enough, the next outcome was better. He also was willing to share as much information as my neurotic brain required, including sending me my follicle measurement and hormone level charts, doing side-by-side comparisons of rounds, etc. 

Even after I got pregnant and ""graduated"" out of the IVF clinic, when I reached out with a concern Dr. Forman quickly offered me an appointment and had me in for a blood draw to confirm that all was okay. I ended up doing a CVS to confirm the PGD/PGS testing (the reason we had done IVF), and while I was no longer officially his patient at that point, he still reached out beforehand to wish me luck and later followed up to ask how it went. 

While Dr. Forman is not overly demonstrative and his manner didn't at first strike me as super smiley or warm, he shows his care through his actions and patient outcomes. With a process as emotionally challenging as IVF, he's the doctor you want managing your treatment. I can't recommend him highly enough. Dr Rudick explains everything very plainly and honestly.  The longer I worked with her the more I liked her.  She continues to have an upbeat outlook even though things did not always go the way we wanted them to, but not so much as to be Pollyanna-ish or falsely optimistic.  She is results oriented and always forward moving - don’t expect her to linger on why something didn’t work or to have an incredibly emotional conversation about your disappointment.  When a result is less than perfect, she’s looking at what to do to optimize that result, or change course to something better/more effective.  
I always felt like she took my questions very seriously and answered them with thought and care, either in person, on the phone, or via email.    Dr. Zev Williams is an amazing, kind hearted, and intelligent physician.  He was very through in explaining step by step what the treatment plan will be.  He was very attentive to any questions or concerns I had throughout the treatment.  From the consultation visit until we conceived, he always made my husband and I feel very important and extremely cared about.  We still keep great communication regarding the progress of my pregnancy. I recommend any patient to see him or his colleagues.I've never had a doctor take the time and be so available. She answered all my questions and most of the time got ahead of them. She was extremely accommodating and understanding to any requests I had. Above all, she felt like a partner - I trusted her and felt like she really cared. While I haven’t seen her for very long, she immediately made my husband and I feel comfortable in her care. She is very knowledgeable but still took the time to confer with her colleagues about some rare situations with our case and let us know that. Dr. Brady always answers emails and phone calls the same day, no matter how many times we email or how many questions we ask!Dr. Brady was wonderful - communicative, sensitive, and her personality is not extreme in any direction: she didn't sugarcoat anything, but also was appropriately excited for me when sharing that my reserve amounts were high or that my egg retrieval had gone well.Dr. Brady was very thorough and helpful. She always had a pleasant attitude when I met her for my appointments and made things very easy. She made me feel very comfortable throughout the entire process. I had a somewhat unsettling experience with another doctor in the practice before becoming a patient of Dr. Brady's. I immediately trusted her and believe her expertise and bedside manner set her apart. She always took the time to listen to my concerns and answer my questions. She is very responsive to phone calls and emails and truly committed to her patients' success.Dr. Forman listened to my concerns and is very good with first time IVF patients. Nothing was too small for his attention and he’s always doing his best for you. He consistently went above and beyond for me the entire time I was in his care. 

A perfect example of this was when I had expressed how much I wanted him to perform the actual IVF procedure rather than another doctor from the clinic. The day of the procedure, it wasn’t guaranteed that he could make it but he rushed to the clinic and made it happen. I actually teared up when I saw him. These things mean the world to women who have no control over their bad fortune.

He and his team understood that these things mattered and what a difference it makes when your concerns are taken seriously. Even the front desk and nurses who draw blood exhibited the same standard of care. Peri, the Egg Donor Program Coordinator, is especially great. She was incredibly helpful and reliable.

I can’t recommend Columbia University Fertility Center enough.

Dr. Forman had carefully read our medical history before meeting with us. On our first visit, a doctor in training attended our consultation, but before leading us into the room, Dr. Forman asked us in a sensitive manner whether this would be ok with us. It was clear that we had the choice to say no and that this would be accepted and respected. During the consultation, he took the time to listen to us, review any medical data we had brought with us, and explain various details of the anticipated procedures to us, weighing different options and providing a clear treatment plan tailored to our specific situation. He directly organized for us to meet with different members on his team to address various aspects of the treatment, and take blood samples for additional diagnostics. Everyone on his team was completely focused on us and our needs, and acted in a calm and efficient, yet supportive manner.At my first appointment, Dr. Rackow was more than 2 hours late.  She apparently had an emergency at the hospital.  I understand OB emergencies happen and as a health care provider myself, I know it happens.  What I don't understand is the front desk staff, they knew she was running late when I checked in but never said anything.  It was only when I overheard the front desk telling other patients to either wait or reschedule that I went up to the front desk myself to inquire, since I had waited nearly an hour by now.  At this point they told me that I actually hadn't been waiting that long because they allow 45 minutes of the new patient appointment for us to fill out paperwork.  I'd never heard of this and I've never needed 45 minutes to fill out new patient paperwork.  They then basically said I could come back another day or reschedule.  Dr. Rackow's schedule is not very frequent and I had already canceled my patients for the day to see her so I opted to wait, I got lunch at Whole Foods and then came back to the appointment.  The entire time the front desk seemed to not care and never bothered to inform me that she was going to be in late.  

I stayed to Columbia against my better judgement (I also trained there so I guess I felt some sense of loyalty), but after the cattle-call morning monitoring visits where I without fail would have to wait nearly an hour and a last minute appointment cancellation by Dr. Rackow, I left the clinic after finishing the infertility/RPL workup.  I could not even get a follow up to discuss the results because Dr. Rackow is just never there.  I had it with Dr. Nataki Douglas.  I made the appointment for first thing in the morning to minimize wait time.  At 20 minutes past my appointment time, I saw Dr. Douglas and some staff roll in the office with coffee and doughnuts, apparently they had gone out to get coffee and no one seemed to care that there were patients on the schedule.

 That really solidified it for me.  Since I was paying fully out of pocket, I felt I couldn't do treatment at Columbia because it just seemed like no one cared at the office.  To me, fertility treatment is quite individualized and when I finally saw Dr. Douglas, I could tell she just read my chart right before the appointment and offered standard treatment options without taking my medical history into consideration.  

 While Dr. McConnell was sometimes in a good mood I also found her to be moody and sometimes curt to me when I asked questions at consultation appointments.

After my first round of IVF i had 6 mature eggs and only 2 fertilized and they transferred one day 6 embryo.  I did not become pregnant and Dr. McConnell was prepared to do the same treatment all over again.  Instead, she should've suggested ICSI and a day 3 transfer (which Columbia apparently does not do).

Overall, I did not feel that Dr. McConnell gave my treatment a lot of personal attention.I did not feel that I received personalized care from any of the doctors I saw at Columbia. 

Upon checking at the center, I was given a buzzer like the kind you get when you are waiting for a table at a restaurant. Then I would get buzzed to billing, buzzed to bloodwork, buzzed to ultrasound, etc. I saw a different doctor ever time I went for monitoring. They generally stayed for 2-3 minutes before moving on, even setting a timer in some cases. I felt rushed to ask any questions before they left. 

We had 2 failed clinics/IUI cycles with Dr. Choi. I spoke with her after one of them. I was very upset and anxious about our fertility journey in general. She was rather cold and basically told me not to get so upset when the chances of an IUI
cycle failing were rather low anyway. 

Dr Brady explained egg freezing clearly, and related it to my personal situation and medical issues. Her staff knew me too and was always very responsive to my needs.Dr Rudick made every effort  to answer all of our questions every step of the way. She was great about checking in about how we were doing emotionally, physically, and financially. She always followed up with a call if there was an issue and I saw a different doctor for monitoring. Dr. Rudick took the time to meet with my wife and I and explain the entire process in elaborate detail both before and after the initial testing. She was always very straightforward in her information but also optimistic and positive.Dr Brady explained her plan for me clearly; I always understood next steps The doctor herself was always very attentive and very quick to respond to emails and questions, but the clinic was run very efficiently which oftentimes made me feel like a number.  I often had to be examined by doctors other than Dr. Brady (another doctor did my retrieval) and all communications was via email. Dr Brady has a great way of communicating in context. It's overwhelming information and she helped me understand my results, things to expect, etc. I always felt heard and understood. I was treated like a human, Dr. Rudick was very patient with me, and was always available by email or by appointment to go through all of my questions. She made me feel like I had full control over the process, and that it was up to me to decide how aggressive I wanted to be, and the pace at which I wanted to proceed.Dr. Forman was always kind, respectful, and took his time explaining all procedures to my husband and I. He never made us feel rushed at any point, and he took his time to answer all our questions. He made sure we understood the pros and cons of all the procedures before they were done.Dr. Forman was ALWAYS available. Whether it was to vent or ask small questions, there was always an email in return. He goes above and beyond for his patients. I traveled in from northern NJ to see him and he was always considerate for that too. I found Dr. Brady to be warm, empathetic and patient, and I felt very comfortable under her care. I was able to email her directly with any questions (which I feel is rare with most physicians), and she would typically respond within 24 hours and answer any questions I had in detail. She would also call me directly herself with any important news and offer to talk about anything I wanted over the phone if email wasn't sufficient. Dr. Williams is so patient and compassionate. I have yet to meet a doctor who values his patients ideas and feedback. He takes the time despite being the head of the research and is the fertility director. Dr. Forman was happy to explain everything about the treatment to me and to discuss our expectations. He also helped schedule treatments around my work travel schedule. He is always available to answer questions over email.First and foremost, we could not be happier with Dr. Rudick. She is a very warm, very personable doctor who truly cares for her patients. In a city like New York where so many woman are trying to conceive, it's challenging to be there 100% for every single patient all the time. I understand that. Still, Dr. Rudick emails with her patients directly and she has a superb staff that steps in when she is with other patients. Dr. Brady is an excellent consultant and above all, a wonderful human being. She takes care of her patients at a very personal level and treats you more than a patient. She listens all of your problems carefully and try to resolve them, even the minutest of issues. She often called me personally on issues which may not be of great significance but in order to make me comfortable, she would always call me and reply my emails even on Sundays. Whenever, I used to contact her thinking of something as a huge issue, she would not only address it but made me comfortable. Throughout the procedure, she was with us as a doctor at a very personal level. She always welcome questions and makes her patients comfortable. She makes the whole procedure very comfortable, memorable and enjoyable. She ensures that she captures every moment of the journey for her patients. She is a wonderful fertility doctor and treats her patients with compassion and love and she is a real gem.The staff at Columbia was also very kind, especially at the Scarsdale office. I got to know many of them well and always felt well treated. We only met once during the initial consultation.  It was immediately clear that she placed me in a specific category based on very preliminary information.  Maybe I caught her on a bad day but she did not have much bedside manner and was not very positive.  There's reality and then there's just negativity.  Dr. Grossman has a pleasant demeanor and my husband and I were immediately put at ease when we spoke with her. She answered all our questions and she reviewed our previous test results. We were so sad when we heard halfway through our treatment that she was leaving the practice to head another one in California. I felt like a human. Dr. K at first was very clinical when we first met her. I think she was trying to be reassuring that we were in competent hands and that she knew a lot. We definitely felt like she knew what she was talking about. She went over the work ups and the previous egg retrievals we had undergone with the doctor she was taking over from. As the treatment progressed, she warmed up much more and I got to know her better at every blood or ultrasound appointment. If she wasn't the one doing the ultrasound, she would go out of her way to come in and look at the results before I left. She was very invested in my treatment. Once we graduated from the IVF treatment,  my mother came to see her to thank her in person. We all hugged and took pictures. She is a special person and an amazing doctor.Dr Brady is compassionate clear and a honest with great bedside manner. I feel great under her care however she isn’t the doctor that always sees me when visiting. She asked me and my husband personal questions about our travel plans, life, family. She took the time to get to know me and then REMEMBERED my answers and asked followup questions on later visits! The office has done a wonderful job of keeping to schedule. I never had to wait more than 10 minutes during morning monitoring, even when there was a full waiting room. Staff always had smiles on their faces and you get to know the nurses well.Dr. Brady has taken the time to really get to know me. She remembers everything that is going on with me, including in my life outside of fertility treatments, and checks in with me personally. I email her often with questions and she is always prompt to reply. When I had my first miscarriage, she seemed almost as upset as I was and offered a much needed hug. She is just personable and authentically human. Eric Forman was very open and honest during our consultation and I didnt feel like he was reciting a speech like every other doctor. Dr. Forman goes out of his was to answer all emails and questions even on Sundays when no one van be reached. I appreciate his transparency.I never felt like a number with Dr Forman. At the beginning of your treatment he sits down with you and takes a long time to explain everything. You never get the sense that his mind is elsewhere. I will admit that during IUI cycles, we got a bit less of his attention. I think this is probably standard and I had to remind myself that while this is my entire world, he is dealing with many patients. Once we made the decision to start IVF I did feel we got a bit more attention from Dr Forman Dr Brady was always attentive and gave full responses to all my questions. She would always respond to all my emails even on after hours. She was always personal and super sweet. I did two retrievals with Dr. Rackow. The first did not get the result we expected and when I was ready to try again, Dr. Rackow thoroughly discussed with me what had happened clinically and what our plan was moving forward. She wanted to get another AMH level and I was hesitant because I didn't really want to know if it was rapidly declining. When my AMH was actually better than it was previously, she called me to personally share this good result. I always felt like she was actively invested in my care. I felt that Dr. Forman actually knew me as an individual. He remembered and acknowledged  details about both my medical history and personal life. He took time to write me emails on his own time to check in with how I was feeling when my husband and I received negative news after a TESE procedure. Dr. Rudick was thoughtful and thorough in her explanation and also listened to my questions with care.Dr. McConnel has a warm and direct bedside manner. She is very knowledgeable and factual and will answer any and all questions, but she is also caring and conveys enough warmth and compassion as she shares options, test results or the like. She always calls me personally with information to share about my results, particularly when they are difficult like when the last PGS testing resulted in no viable embryos. She is not pushy and is willing to go along with the ideas I suggest as well as help me understand what other options are available. I have appreciated her warm candor a lot. I felt that I was treated like a human with Dr. Rudick because she was very kind, understanding and empathetic. Dr. Forman absolutely takes the time to sit down with you hear your story and explain his hypothesis. Even before you start explaining, he shows he has studied your medical history thoroughly. When contacting him, he always know perfectly well who you and your partner are and is on top of thing 24-7. Dr Forman was my 3rd fertility doctor after going to other IVF clinics in NYC. His level of personal attention and detail is amazing. He never rushes you and takes  a lot of time to answer your questions. He really took a lot of time to understand why my IVF response was poor to make a customized plan for me Dr. Forman and his staff were very kind, informative, educated, clear and concise. They treated me just the way I treat others!Human I felt mostly. It is a busy practice so one should be prepared with questions and ask while she’s there. Her spirit is warm and she took her time. Her staff always tried to help me but sometimes info was lost in the process of transfer. The postal does not post results yet so you may play phone tag I. Getting someone on the phone to review. However everyone was warmDr Rudick always makes me feel like a human. Columbia as a clinic has changed a lot in the past 3 years as well. I went there to conceive my first child in 2016 and it was a mess. It feels quite congenial now. That could be also because they see me day in and out. Conceiving our second child has been a longer and a more arduos process than the first one. Dr. Forman provided us with such individualized care! He has a great memory and remembers everything detail of your treatment. Whenever I had a question or concern, he would email me back usually within half an hour. Truly amazing for such a busy doctor!!I felt Dr Rackow took special attention to my case and would contact me personally to discuss important aspects of my treatment plan rather than her nurse in most cases. Dr. Brady was so warm. She remembered details about me from visit to visit, always had a smile on and took the time to answer my questions. Dr Grossman is incredibly warm and friendly. While Columbia is a bit of a zoo, whenever I saw or spoke with her, time slowed down and she was present, engaged and eager to listen and answer questions. During our time with Dr Grossman, there was a period of over a year that we took off, and when we came back, she remembered details about our lives like she was an old friend when other doctors elsewhere had forgotten my name in a week's time.Dr. Forman and the whole Columbia Fertility center were SUCH a breath of fresh air. I had been going to RMA before where I very much felt like a number, not a human. At Columbia the office is small, the wait time is non-existent, and even though it can be busy it always felt, at every single step of the way, like every person cared about me and making sure that I was being taken care of in all ways, physically and emotionally. I really can't say enough good things. It was SUCH a good, relaxing, reassuring experience going there.Dr. Karipcin not only is extremely knowledgeable in her field, which was something very important for me, but also very personal and respectful.  She always carefully and patiently listened to all my concerns about treatment, procedure, and what to do during and after.  She answered every single question I had (which were a lot) in simple terms to make sure I understood, which I greatly appreciated.  I felt I could really trust her.  I felt safe during treatment and egg retrieval. She did the egg retrieval herself and saw me before the procedure and after, which I thought was very thoughtful. My experience with her could not have been better.  She is a great doctor and a great person.    Dr Forman made sure we understood everything that was happening, he thoroughly explained all the procedure steps and he was directly  available by email and phone  for any questions I had during treatment. During transfer he made sure I had copies of the implantation scan and even gave me the egg dish to take home which I really appreciated, it made it feel less clinical.Not only we were treated human, with dignity, patience and respect, we always felt priority ! Dr. Williams genuinely cared for our success. He always took the time to explain things making eye contact while he spoke. He works very gently and has refined bed side manners. He made sure to give me a call back even on days the center was closed, Dr. Williams went a long way, beyond his call of duty, to ensure my safety and well being. Dr. Williams is one of a kind, both, as an expert in his medical field and in being a devoted, dedicated doctor.Dr. Williams was very polite to us, he made us feel that he has all the time for us. He explained every detailed until we understood it. He explained the process and steps. We felt very comfortable, knowing that Dr. Williams is monitoring every step of the way just as if we're his only patient.Doctor Williams and his nurse, Laura, truly understood my feelings of desperation for help and helplessness because my husband and I had experienced 11 miscarriages and a neonatal loss and had no answers as to why.  They both treated us with urgency, and from the very first consultation, outlined a plan of tests that would help us find answers, and ultimately, hope.  Within one week of meeting Dr. Williams for the first time, he had figured out the source of our infertility (Asherman’s syndrome) and had scheduled the first surgery we needed to work on correcting it!  Within 6 months, the corrective procedures had been completed and we were ready to try again—and WITHIN ONE YEAR, we were pregnant with our daughter who was born months later!  After five years of pregnancies, and other fertility doctors who would not treat us for fear that we may skew their success numbers after so many unexplained losses, Dr. Williams took us as patients—understood our grief and responded with compassion and hope.  We have a family now because of him.Dr. Williams always made eye contact when he spoke to me, and I felt as though he was constantly assessing my emotional reaction to whatever information he was giving me.The clinic processes about 40 women an hour in the morning.  The doctor who is primarily assigned to you doesn't even do your transfer.  So you get to know ""your"" doctor, but then you have a random doctor do the transfer.  I am so glad that I chose to use Columbia when my husband and I struggled to conceive. Dr. McConnell is brilliant and also kind and comforting throughout what can be a very anxiety-producing process. She is patient with me and answers all of my questions, and I never feel rushed. My first time meeting Dr. Rudick we went over my fertility records. She asked questions and also listened to me. The first clinic I went to I didn’t get none of that. They barely spoke to me about my failed IUI’s and didn’t even try to see why it wasn’t working. Dr. Rudick impressed me early on as being both intelligent and attentive.  She is very thorough and very quick to get what’s on my mind. She made me feel positive and gave me confidence.Dr. Forman made me feel that I was important and not just another patient. He followed up with me through email, and whenever I had a question, he would respond right away.  He was there for me throughout the process.I began seeing Dr McConnell after a negative experience with another Dr in the practice. I had just undergone 4 unsuccessful IUIs and it was time to move on to IVF. During our IVF consultation Dr McConnell was very informative as well as warm and took her time answering all of our questions. Dr. Douglas is easy to talk to and explains things in great detail. She understands that we have busy lives and wanted to make treatment as easy as possible for us. She seems both ""real"" and empathetic in her interactions.She did not ask about my goals or manage my expectations. I was told we would get pregnant quickly and without any issue. Even after the first failed embryo transfer did not take, she did not discuss any possible changes to our protocol. I distinctively remember that in our follow up appointment to discuss our failed transfer, she sat back cross her fingers and asked ""what can i do for you?"" That question struck me as uncaring and cold.  All she suggested was to follow the same protocol and transfer the next embryo. We did as we were told for the next 2 embryos (makes 3 total transfers) using the same protocol and received the same negative results each transfer. I saw Dr. McConnell during my consultation. She seemed friendly and was very positive about us succeeding. She indicated that the tests that my GYN ran were thorough and that our only issue was morphology (male factor). She believed we could easily get pregnant using IUI with no drugs. We were obviously excited to hear this and immediately signed up. Unfortunately, we never saw Dr. McConnell again - EVER. We did 3 IUIs at the clinic and never once saw OUR doctor after the consultation. This is shocking to me as I had A LOT of visits over the course of 3 IUIs. I felt like a number and not a human. The visits were very rushed.  Any questions I had Dr. Rackow explained fully, however she did not volunteer to give me any information by herself.   I learned more about my procedures from the internet than from my own doctor.  
It takes a month to schedule an appointment (which doesn't last more than 10 minutes) because she is in the office only once a week for half the day.  
You cannot contact your doctor with questions.  Instead, you need to call the office and talk to the nurse.  If you have a question for the doctor then the nurse takes the question and it is supposed to be answered in 24 to 48 hours.  However when I left a message with the nurse - my call was never returned.  If you need immediate response then I think there is a fee for that. 
Doctor never followed up on the results.  Dr. Rackow""prescribed"" 3 cycles and then asked me to return for ""follow up"" visit which also took less than 10 minutes where she suggested I do another 3 cycles without changing the protocol. Dr. Guarnaccia is an excellent, thoughtful and sensitive physician. When I started my first cycle for the egg freezing, when I came in on day 6 for my first ultrasound with the doctor on call to see whether the follicles were maturing, the results were negative - and I was instructed by that doctor to stop the fertility shots. I was in tears and Dr. Guarnaccia so happened to be in the office that Saturday, and purposely went out of his way to find me to calm me down and explain that we are not robots--we are human beings and one regimen of shots that works for one patient does not necessarily work for another. He strongly urged me not to give up and encouraged me to do another cycle for the egg freezing and advised that we would do a different regiment of shots. I appreciated his feedback and ultimately agreed, and while that cycle did not get as many eggs as hoped, we did get through the whole cycle and froze six eggs. I was advised to do another cycle to maximize the number of eggs but my finances (and well-being) decided against it for the time being.  After each failed cycle, Dr. McConnell just recommended the same protocol without additional testing. I'm not sure if it's Dr. McConnell's preference or the clinic's, but she doesn't individualize or alter a protocol even when it fails or the patient has an adverse reaction. The oral estrace that they use for FET cycles made me very sick, but she refused to let me do another FET protocol or consider one of the many alternatives forms of estrogen. Things began okay- he was warm, informative, and thorough during the initial consult. Unfortunately, as time went on it was clear that he did not remember who I was no matter how many times I called or returned for an appointment. On one occasion he forgot something he had advised and we had discussed directly regarding my course of treatment and on another occasion I discovered (from his nurse) that he had forgotten to tell me about an additional test I needed which nearly interfered with my next planned IUI.  He was never rude or impatient but my impression over time was that he couldnt keep track of all his patients and just went with a ""one size fits all"" type of approach.She spoke to me pleasantly for sure, not condescendingly. However, I felt like she wasn't really paying attention to my own personal history. For example, she said something several times about my endometriosis and... I don't have that! At all! I had to keep correcting her because she had read some letter wrong. I could have been mistreated because of that.Not once did she know the history of our records. The last consult was the last straw for us. She had absolutely no idea about our history and spent the entire time searching for her records on her computer in fits and starts, and ended up spending hardly any time discussing our case history or customizing a plan for us.As Columbia has a massive fertility dept and I saw several drs during the year and a half of IUI and IVF attemps, dr rudck always treated me as if I were her only patient. She remembered my personal situation everytime I saw her she never sugar coated anything but was never doubtful or negative either. When I conceived at 43 after one IVF treatment she told me to play the lottery!  That was the only time she expressed that the odds had been against me He was very honest and open about what needed to be done. As an SMC he made me feel accepted and did not judge based on my circumstances or age.Other than my first office visit I never saw Dr. Sauer. I saw a different doctor at each visit each of whom were cold and made no effort to connect on a human level. When entering the office I would sign in and receive a blue pager identical to the kind I get at my local fast food restaurant. At the fast food restaurant I don't need them to learn my name but at my doctors office I expected them to take enough interest in at least momentary learning my name during the time that they are treating me. It made the whole experience feel like a factory or meet market. Columbia is a total factory and it not well run.  The nurses are terrible and it is very difficult to get through to anyone.  Dr. Rudick was not careful in treatment and was very imprecise in her explanations.  I think she was down the middle on this.  She's a nice woman, she explains things well, she is never abrupt or rude.  But she obviously sees a lot of patients and I doubt she'd know my name if she didn't look down at the chart.  She's very calm and I think that can come across as disinterested.  I did feel like she listened to me and I feel like she always answered my questions well.She's very nice. However 1.) every failure resulted in being presented statistical charts, not problem solving 2.) after being shown said charts, we were asked what we wanted to do next. We expected expertise and assertive care.The office was like a factory. Dr. Lobo didn't actually perform any of my procedures, and on my 4th IUI, the doctor said, ""This must be your first IUI - you seem nervous"" Clearly he hadn't read my file. It was clear that they were trying to cycle people through as quickly as possible and I didn't trust that I would have success when the people performing my procedures weren't even familiar with my record. He Explained his assessment of our infertility issues with his feet up on the desk and an iced coffee in his hand.  He was cavalier and generally did not seem to care beyond the center's statistics. Dr Lobo followed up with phone calls but besides that it was the nurse that managed my case. Dr. Forman was a kind, caring, and attentive partner throughout our journey. He was thoughtful and interested when we brought questions and compassionate as he delivered information.Dr. Forman has incredible bedside manner. He is kind, patient and calm. He explains everything and answers all questions. De. Rudick is a very comprehensive doctor, she lets you explain everything and listen to every detail. I felt very comfortable.The first visit with Dr. Brady was very informative and she performed my first IUI. After that  all procedures were done by technicians and IUI's done by different Dr's. I was only able to speak with my nurse moving forward and found it hard to communicate with my Dr.Dr. McConnell has great bedside manner. Her demeanor puts you at ease. She is patient and listens to your concerns and questions and takes the time to treat you and address your particular situation. We immediately made us feel at ease in her care from Day 1. She walked us through the process and made us feel comfortable asking questions. He listened to all our concerns and questions and gave us all our options and made us feel taken care of.  He is available practically 24/7 to answer any questions or concerns as well.Dr. Stahl performed his duties with respect.Dr Brady has been patient with my questions and has made herself available to myself and my partner whenever we have questions or concerns. She was always empathetic. She isn't super warm but you can tell she cares about you.Dr. Rudick and her staff were consistently readily available to answer questions, including on nights and weekends. Dr. Rudick always remembered me and our prior conversations, and always made me feel like my questions and concerns were valid. Dr. Forman was always very attentive and empathetic, and addressed all our concerns. He always responded very quickly to our emails, and called us in person whenever there were important test results.Dr Forman is amazing. He treats you like he would to family or a good friend. He's very knowledgeable, kind and easy to trust never once making you feel like You are one of many patients. He's always there when you need him. Fertility treatment can take many attempts and often leaves you alone and in a dark place from time to time so having a good caring doctor like him is the best. Dr. Williams took the time to listen to my concerns and learn about my specific case.  He discussed in depth with me the treatment option that would work best for me and my partner, and was available to speak, usually within a day, if I requested.She is very understanding of my very particularity situation. She has always been available when I needed to talk to her. I feel like when she explains things to me she is actually talking to me not just spiting out information. She shows that she really cares about helping me get pregnant. Dr. Choi is very compassionate and has a wonderful way to keep the patient informedWhile it can be tough at times to get thru to the staff there, Dr Zimmerman always made himself available and was responsive to our needs.The office was a nightmare to deal with. They didn't answer questions, I had to call over and over again to get basic questions answered, they wouldn't send my records without being hounded. I saw people show up at the office just to ask questions because they couldn't get responses.From the moment you walk in it looks and feels like a factory.  With each visit you don't know who will be your doctor and when Dr G was the doctor he treated me like he had never seen me before. Dr. Thornton was calm, funny, and had an easy-going nature.  My husband and I felt comfortable with him.  He was compassionate and understanding.Very warm demeanor. Very knowledgeable as well.She really took an interest in our case and went over and beyond to help us conceive. She listened to our concerns and offered some out of the box solutions.They talked to me.  I was a person - not a uterus.   There were choices to be made and my opinion was solicited.   Words that echo in my ears to this day ""We can do a lot with technology but after the transfer, which embryo will become a person is left up to G-d.""Dr. Paula C. Brady is an amazing doctor, with really good bedside manners. She was always available and reverted back to my questions even at odd times during the day. She was always supportive and guided me in the right direction through every cycle. She always gave me full support throughout the entire journey. Dr. Brady really made us feel cared for throughout our entire journey. Always kind, knowledgeable, and most importantly, explained everything in clear terms. He was easy to talk to and answered my questions and concerns in a way I understood.Dr. Forman is incredibly thorough. He takes the time to explain every process every step of the way. He also is quick to respond on email when needed.Dr. Forman is the kindest doctor I have ever worked with. I have a lot of anxiety and he was patient with me and answered all my questions within minutes! I felt like I was his only patient the entire time that I was working with him, while I know he has many. She's a good doctor, she really know her stuff.  I felt a sense of hope when I first saw her. She was very kind, and took her time to explain everything in detail.  Columbia is a big facility with a lot of patients so it is easy to feel like a number and I definitely felt like one sometimes.He rushed me the initial conversations and seemed frustrated when I asked him questions.  He seemed very frustrated when I mentioned I went to another doctor to consult about my fibroid issues, despite the fact that he doesn't treat fibroids.  I got the sense that he wanted to rush into this very expensive egg freezing process for his benefit only.I felt that most doctors involved treated me like a person and not like a number, despite the fact they saw many, many patients a day. That said, I am not someone who needs coddling or a warm fuzzy person holding my hand through everything. I'm all business.While doctor Lobio was our primary doctor, we met with different doctors on every appointment. Doctors were talking to us from the paper work they had in front of them and not based on a prior relation. 

We had 23 embryos, of which 8 seemed good enough for transfer or freezing on day 5. We had one transferred. On day six, to our surprise we learned that none seemed to be good enough to freeze. We got an impersonal call and there was no explanation, nor was anyone available for an explanation. When in panic that they would discard good embryos, that they mixed up our file with someone else's, it took me 2 hours to talk to someone who simply confirmed: none of them were good enough for storage and we didn't make a mistake. End of story...I feel like Dr. Lobo knows my case and is up to date on the procedures I've had done, my case, and the next steps. He is very compassionate and called to tell us he was sorry for our loss.Dr. Rudick really got to know me and my partner. Dr Forman and his team are truly amazing. They make it personal and accessible. The clinic was extremely warm and friendly. The Doctor was straight to the point and stated the facts.  There are not enough words to describe my adoration of this woman. She is an extremely compassionate, intelligent and friendly doctor. She is very communicative and always makes time for my questions. Very responsive with phone calls and information. Dr. McConnell took the time to know us and explained everything she was able to do.  Most importantly, she listened to our concerns.As the head of Columbia, he was very rushed. Very informative, but not very personal. Very friendly and cared tremendous felt like family Dr Choi is the best. I only left Columbia because she did.Rachel was very kind and warm. Dr Lobo is excellent. He has excellent bedside manners. He is very knowledgable and speaks and asks questions with lots of empathy Nd yet he is very clear and precise about treatment ideas, etc. She definitely got to know us well, and she and the other doctors were very kind and willing to work with me to make sure I was comfortable. Some had warmer bedside manners than others but all were great. Beth was a great listener, she explained things very clearly and seemed to judge pretty well how much detail we wanted. We found her easy to talk to and nonjudgmental.Routine procedure 




....She is kind, brilliant, and does not rush me.Staff in the city office treat you like a number Briana had so much patience with me.  She is wonderful and caring. I am a single  woman going through this process alone and she has been extremely attentive. I could not ask for more.She was lovelyWhenever I met with Dr. Choi, I felt like she really listened to my worries/concerns and tried to address them in a caring, personal way.He was very empathetic, very thorough and straightforward. Very very professorial and not interested in the business side of IVF treatments I don't have enough words to express my gratitude for Dr. Eric Forman and his staff at Columbia University Fertility under his lead.  The staff is very kind, welcoming and very professional.  From the receptionist to the doctors, nurses and all the way to the last person in the Lab you will encounter only wonderful people.  It is like God had handpicked this team.  As for the Dr. Forman, well... he is definitely a godsend!  He is the kindest doctor you will ever meet.  What makes him special - apart from his experience and knowledge in the field along with his high successful fertility rate, is his availability and willingness to kindly answer all your questions (good, bad or just silly) thru all channels possible (email, phones, sms, face-to-face, etc.).  Dr. Forman made both my husband and I feel safe, secure and in good hands.  Dr. Forman and his staff are so friendly they felt like extended family.  During our vacation overseas, Dr. Forman kept monitoring my test results over there and was in constant contact with us, day and night, even though there was a big time difference.  Prior to coming to Columbia University Fertility center, I tried two clinics before.  However, out of all, I recommend you Columbia Fertility center and Dr. Forman from all my heart!  Have faith and go meet Dr. Forman at Columbia Fertility!Dr. McConnell came recommended by two other people who successfully gave birth to healthy children under her care. I had an option of going to her Westchester office or the NYC location, I chose NYC and the care I received there was impeccable. Everyone becomes family after months of visits.  I had a consultation visit with Dr. Forman recently. I was very satisfied with how he explained the potions I have and he answered all my questions Dr. Rudick is very kind, straightforward, and helpful in my treatment. She is very knowledgeable and compassionate. Dr. Rudick was splendid all the way through! I had many difficult moments, and she was there to explain what was happening and give me hope; and she rejoiced with me when things were going well: I felt supported, cared for, and understood!She listened to my concerns and took my medical history into account.Columbia is a large, busy practice, so each provider has a lot of patients that they see.  As such, many of the monitoring appointments were with providers who did not know me and did not have the full details of my treatment.  However, I I did feel that my care was personalized to my needs with Dr. Rudick specifically, and felt that my nurse and doctor paid attention to my needs as a person and worked with me to gain the results I needed.  The level of communication is unlike any other doctor I've been treated by - follow-ups are consistent and the ability to reach my doctor directly via email at any and all hours of the day is simply priceless. During such a stressful and emotional process, knowing Dr. Forman is reachable to alleviate additional worries is such an incredible peace of mind. She and her team were always responsive whenever my husband and I had any questions or concerns, and made sure that we were comfortable with every step of treatments.Dr. Brady was very warm and understanding and always put me at ease during the process, even from the 1st consultation.  She was always available to answer my questions and responded to my emails very quickly.  She explained things in a way that we could easily understand them. Paula Brady is such a caring physician. She always responded to my emails immediately and answered all of my questions throughly.  She knew that I have a medical background and was able to tailor her updates to exactly what I wanted and needed to know. Dr. Brady was so great and I appreciated her style, which was caring but also data-driven. She went through everything with me in detail during our in-person details. She was also always responsive through email and phone. I felt as though she was very invested in my success, but also very upfront around expectations and treatments so I knew what possible next steps could be.Dr. Brady took the time to explain to me my options and why she chose the specific route that we ended up taking. She listened to my concerns and showed me genuine care and respect throughout the process. Dr. Brady exudes warmth and compassion unlike other doctors that I have encountered along the way. Dr. Williams had the most incredible bedside manner that I have ever seen from a Doctor. He is the best doctor I have ever had. He is incredibly caring, an amazing listener and truly works through the emotional as well as medical complications that come with fertility treatment.Dr. Brady makes sure to take the time to thoroughly explain everything that my body was going through which totally helped me understand the process.  She treats her patients with so much care and devotion.  She makes the complex and stressful infertility process more manageable because she is so thoughtful and genuine about how to approach everything.Dr Grosasman Becht is very professional. She maintains a constant smile on her face when discussing my care(the smile sometimes come across as rehearsed rather than genuine). She covers all aspects of my care including benefits vs risk of each drug I have been prescribed. So far, her team has been good with communicating pertinent information/updates. 

Dr. Forman goes above and beyond to answer every question you have, consider all your specific circumstances, and give you as much information as you need. He's very professional and can report results in a straightforward manner, but he also understands what an emotional rollercoaster IVF is and makes himself extremely available for his patients. Dr Rudick was always quick to answer my questions either over the phone or via secure email.  She provided thoughtful responses, and it felt like she always gave me the honest truth, even when it was not what I wanted to hear, in a very informative, but kind manner.  I had a complication with my egg retrieval and Dr Rudick (as well as others at Columbia) followed up with extreme concern and care.  They corresponded with the ER doctors and with my husband and myself several times a day to check in and make sure I was okay.Dr. Zev Williams and colleagues (just to name a few-Drs. Eric Forman and Briana Rudick) are amazing physicians.  They were very attentive to all my questions and concerns throughout my treatment.  Questions and concerns were answered immediately to a few hours when asked.  Staff and physicians knew my name and greeted me each time I was in the office.  It was a family feel and they were going through each step with my husband and I.She is very personable and answers emails and phone calls very quickly.Dr. Brady kept in great touch with me throughout, was very personal, and was very attuned to the unique concerns my oncological situation presented.Dr. Brady was very personable and compassionate. Dr. Brady is a talented doctor and is clearly devoted to her profession and her patients.  She always took the time (even on her busiest days) to answer all of my questions clearly and directly.  She has great bedside manner and a calming personality.    ",8.300000000000006,8.399999999999995,"Dr. Rudick is very professional and knowledgeable. I felt very comfortable in Dr. McConnell's care and always felt that I could go to her with questions. Dr. Williams was exactly who we needed after an unsuccessful attempt at IVF with another clinic. Dr. Forman is very open about the treatment protocol. After two IVF cycles, I inquired about donor eggs as well and she gave me all the information about that process, even though we weren’t ready to take that step yet. There are far better and faster ways to communicate today e.g. emailI don't know if Dr. Rackow is really familiar with many of her patients' cases/treatment progress. I left only one message but it was not returned. Although he didn't perform my procedures he did make sure to walk me through every step and process before it occurred. He is quiet and unassuming but goes above and beyond what you can expect from a doctor. She was always aware of every detail of my current cycle. I always felt that I could trust her and that she had our best interests at heart. He is the kindest doctor you will ever meet. He was very through in explaining step by step what the treatment plan will be. To me, fertility treatment is quite individualized and when I finally saw Dr. Douglas, I could tell she just read my chart right before the appointment and offered standard treatment options without taking my medical history into consideration. Overall, I did not feel that Dr. McConnell gave my treatment a lot of personal attention. Her staff knew me too and was always very responsive to my needs. Dr Brady explained her plan for me clearly; I always understood next steps The doctor herself was always very attentive and very quick to respond to emails and questions, but the clinic was run very efficiently which oftentimes made me feel like a number. She is a very warm, very personable doctor who truly cares for her patients. She believed we could easily get pregnant using IUI with no drugs. At the fast food restaurant I don't need them to learn my name but at my doctors office I expected them to take enough interest in at least momentary learning my name during the time that they are treating me. End of story...I feel like Dr. Lobo knows my case and is up to date on the procedures I've had done, my case, and the next steps. She is very communicative and always makes time for my questions. Dr. Brady is a talented doctor and is clearly devoted to her profession and her patients."
1,Columbia University,advice,"I would tell her that she is in good hands, to trust the process, and to ask a lot of questions to ease anxiety and understand all of the details and risks. At points, it can seem like there are no answers and it is all trial-and-error, but with each cycle, more information is gathered that will lead you toward the right treatment for you. Ask all the questions.Ask questions and always be your own advocate no matter who your doctor is. I would advise patients in general to ask their IVF doctor about their chances for success with each cycle given their individual circumstances. We did not discuss this in too much detail, and I did not think to push for more information on my chances of success because I was so focused on just starting treatment. I was 38yo when I did the egg retrieval. 12 eggs were retrieved, 7 fertilized, 3 embryos made it to day 5 and only 1 embryo was genetically normal after screening. I was surprised and disappointed that this was considered a good result for my age. I was expecting and hoping to have at least 2-3 good embryos. Every doctor wants to paint the most optimistic picture possible so I think it's important to ask about the worst outcomes too so you can prepare yourself and not be overly disappointed. Whether it’s Dr. Williams or any other doctor, it’s really important to advocate for yourself and don’t be afraid to ask questions and share your needs. Dr. Forman has a calm, dry manner of presenting information. Personally, I appreciated that, as I found it very clear, but I could imagine someone else finding it slightly cold. My advice would be to get to know the doctor and give him a chance. He is a very kind and thoughtful person, just a bit of an introvert. :)My advice would be to always have an agreed course of action with Dr. Rudick and to make it specific. I would advise to trust Dr. Brady as she knows her work, being competent and knowledgeable and follow her each and every instruction very religiously, including timings and all other dos and dont's.Ask lots of questions.  Even if it's after the appointment, she will always get back to you. A lot of things about this process took longer and were more complicated than I expected, so make sure you ask for details. If you want to have more direct interaction with her, you should voice this early on.  This way if she cannot oblige, you know from the onset and can make an informed decision.Don't be shy about asking her anything. She's a clear communicator and she's happy to answer your questions. And she has a way of making you feel calm and reassured. Don't rush to conclusions if she appears very clinical. She is a very warm and sweet person. She is dedicated and competent and that is what you want during a time like this. Understand that you are receiving care at a clinic and not a private practice Don't judge her by her accent. She is very capable, caring and knowledgable. Dr. Williams is extremely sought out and very busy, but I never felt that he didn't get back to me. When I was going through setbacks, Dr. Williams would call me personally just to check up on my mental well being - he really truly cares. If I was unable to get a hold of him, my nurse was able to get the information I needed.Ask all the fertility questions you have ever had! She will answer all of them! Eric Forman may seem standoffish but I've come to realize that's just his personality. He seems a bit of an introvert. He does however know fertility and takes extra care to ensure you feel comfortable. Without Dr. Forman offering other options I would never have come to learn new things about myself and my fertility.Don’t expect a ton of attention with regards to the IUIs. Dr Forman even admitted to me that they don’t expect them to work (which I had always suspected, anyway.) however, with regards to IVF he takes it much more seriously Dr Paula is fantastic but regardless of the doctor it is still lengthy and emotionally draining procedure. Just be patient it won't happen over night. Do not be hesitant to ask any and all questions initially. She was very willing to answer them. I would say Dr. Forman leans more towards the blunt end of sharing clinical information and doesn’t shield his patients from any potential risks or poor outcomes that can be scary to hear. If it seems off-putting initially, just know he truly does care and made that known to me through his diligent follow up and never forgetting any details of my case. I'm still learning to navigate the system of this clinic and it might've been helpful to ask the doctor more about that. But our one-on-one interaction was good.I would advise any prospective patient of Dr McConnell to ask any questions they have because she is more than willing to answer and fertility treatments can be daunting and there is so much to learn. Take advantage of the fact that he answers all his emails within an hour. Ask every doubt you have, he´ll be there. Listen carefully to what he says and trust his judgement and ability to try something new. IVF is always a choice. There is a huge amount of pressure, when seeing a fertility doctor, to get pregnant as soon as possible--but making each decision with your partner, without pressure from anyone else is very important.Bring your questions with you that you could sister ahead of time and while there. She is readily available when in front of you and welcomes your questions. After she leaves the room you work with staff so it can be some phone tag getting back to her. So ask away when you have face to face time!She is compassionate and relatable. However, I did feel a bit lost, like why am I doing what I am doing. What is the reason, why 1,2, or 3 IUI's, why not something else. Is this related to my age, something else? I feel that if I asked questions I would get an answer but if I didn't I wouldn't really know why I was doing the treatments I was. A reason for this could also be because we have unexplained infertility and there are routine treatments for that. You will be in very good hands! Ask tons of questions and don’t be a shamed to ask more than once. Go see her NOW! Do not be shy to ask questions. When you have her, her time is yours, but it can be hard to get in touch with her at other times, with you needing to go through her nurse or coordinator.Ask lots of questions! But also rest assured you're working with a great doctor. Oh and when they say you can email them they REALLY mean it, Dr. Forman and his nurse would get back to me SO fast even on weekends.Trust her.  She will really do what is best for you. Don’t hesitate, we are in love with our beautiful baby girl who wouldn’t be here without Dr Forman.Give your doctor as much information as you can. When it comes to diagnosing and treating infertility ""small"" details matter, ""big time!"" Also, don't be shy to ask. understanding whats going on puts you ease,If you want to have a Doctor that won't leave a stone unturned, meet Dr. Williams.Bring your data and know your clinical history—Dr. Williams brilliantly connected a sensitivity to gluten (that I was completely unaware of!) as a potential cause for some of my earlier miscarriages.  He will ask you everything, even things that don’t seem associated as he rules out possible causes—so be open, honest and as thorough so as to help him as much as possible!Have a list of questions ready, because he will be willing to answer them all.Just avoid Columbia in total. Be proactive. Ask any questions you have.Don’t be afraid to ask questions. Dr. Rudick will communicate very well with you. She will even email you if to make sure you and her on the same page. Open your mind, be positive and don't hold anything back. I would tell a prospective patient to tell Dr Forman everything like what works for you and what doesn't. He listens. Example: if you can't get to a scheduled appointment, let him know and he will make it work.  Also to ask questions even if it doesn't makes sense, he will explain everything. Come with a list of questions.Obviously the doctors can't work 7 days a week for morning monitoring so don't expect her to be there for all your appointments.Do not expect any compassion or customized treatment. This is not a doctor I would recommend unless you know (and who does?) you only need to go through this once to be successful and you have no need for customized treatment/protocol.Don't expect to have easy access to this doctor or even her nurses. Have as many questions ready as possible.  Write them down and go through them.  Don't get rushed answers as satisfactory. Dr. Guarnaccia is a straight-shooter and will not beat around the bush. If you're looking for someone to sugarcoat it, he's not the one. He is diligent and will ask questions of you--and welcomes questions from you as well.  Go elsewhere if possible. Otherwise, advocate heavily for yourself: push for answers, follow up repeatedly, and make sure you stay on top of every detail of your care.You probably have to stay on top of him by calling or going in constantly otherwise things may get missed.Assert yourself. If it seems like she's missing info don't be afraid to speak up. She won't get annoyed.Avoid CWRC at all costs. The only reason you go there, and i repeat, the only reason you go to CWRC is if your financial situation requires it (they are not as expensive and accept more insurance plans). 

If you do have to go to CWRC, avoid Dr. Rackow at all costs. She also btw, only visits CWRC in mid-town once a week for half a day - which means getting time with her for a consult is next to impossible.Don’t expect a dr thatsugar coats the facts.  She gets to the point but with a softness because she is compassionate. She has children and with that comes empathy for the desire to want a baby.  She made me feel comfortable, laugh, and stay excited I would say that although the clinic is big and it seems like a factory being run, Dr. Zimmerman will be there to help you if you reach out.I recommend that each patient is on top of their treatment plan and asks many questions before undergoing treatment to ensure it is the most appropriate plan.
Go elsewhere.The same advice I would give to anyone who needs infertility treatment: educate yourself and advocate for yourself.  Dr. McConnell is smart, I did a lot of research and I never asked her a question where I wasn't satisfied with her answer.  She is nice and I did feel like she cared about getting me pregnant, but she's not a super enthusiastic or warm person, so if you need someone like that, I would try a different doctor.  In the end, we trusted her guidance on our treatment, and I'm glad we did.If you get a diagnosis, great. If you get a shoulder shrug and are reminded of the statistical charts, leave. Also... Look at the fertility success statistics at Cornell and NYU (neither of which we went to for our success). They are superior.If you want good sound advice but don't care as much about a personal connection with your RE, Dr.Lobo will be great for you. Some people prefer to keep things all business and are more analytical in their approach - in this case, Dr. Lobo would be a great fit.  Come as prepared as possible to your consultation - have questions ready to go, and do some research in advance. 
He has the type of personality where he thinks he is god's gift to those around him.  Don't expect any genuine warmth or caring. Make sure you have your questions lined up and your follow up questions and do not feel intimated if you get the sense you are being rushed.  Keep talking until you are comfortable with the next steps of care.  Don't be afraid to ask questions and assert yourself as a partner in the process. He is not threatened by your interest or active participation. You are in good hands. Get your questions ready - he will always answer them carefully. Be ready to answer a lot of questions Dr. Rudick makes sure she knows every detail before moving on. She is super informative, but you will not see her during visits.She will not make you feel rushed so feel free to ask any questions you have. Be your own advocate, and educate yourself. She is incredible and will listen to you. The Scarsdale Office staff amazing , but it’s clear there is lack of communication with the Manhattan office, that can be frustrating. Dr Brady never made me feel that my questions are too much so please ask away so you are well informed of the process and what you can expect. Ask any question that comes to mind, he is open to listen and will answer any concern you might have.Don't worry about the awkwardness of seeing a Urologist, it is well worth the uncomfortableness to possibly have improved chances of conceiving naturally.I would advise to trust her but at the same time, not be afraid to ask questions.  She can be short because she is confident and knows what she’s doing, but you may require further explanation and details. She has never made me feel that my questions are too much. She isn't the most warm but she does care. Contact her and her nurse Julissa via email - they are both very responsive. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Trust Dr. Forman's advice.Fertility treatment is a highly complex topic and Dr. Forman knows a lot and is always there to answer questions so ask anything you feel uncertain about! Keep going until you get what you are looking for!Be persistent. Be open about your situation, through out my treatment since she knows my specific situation she has been careful about certain things that she knows I am worried about. She has tailored my treatment because of this situation. Saying that Dr. Choi is amazing is simply reductive. Trust her wholeheartedly, she is the best guide you can hope for given the circumstances. She is the rare medical professional that offers in-depth theoretical knowledge, unmatched practical experience honed through years of work at extremely busy practices and a deeply empathetic nature. Be patient and understand that the clinic itself is a little over worked and you will be frustrated by some things. You have to hound the clinic to get any information or responses to questions. Ask all questions when you're there.Don't go to Columbia.  Period!Do not be scared to ask questions.  He is quite patient, understanding and down to Earth.Maybe push her to give you more options then what’s originally presented. Trust her. Ask lots of questions and be curious as to what she may be thinking. She can come up with some great ideas!He is VERY smart.   He has seen a lot and done a lot.   Ask questions and you will be answered.   Just be open with her and open to discuss your concerns with her. She’s more than just a great physician. She’s very caring, and personable. So let her know exactly how you’re feeling at any given moment. Don't be afraid to have an exhausting list o questions.Don’t be afraid to ask questions!No advice is needed. She is a very thorough doctor. She is to the point so it can feel a bit brusque. She was perfect for me because I am not great at small talk. Ask  a lot of questions, probably try to see other doctors in his center.The same advice I'd give anyone undergoing fertility treatments. Be informed. Ask as many questions as you can. She is not warm and fuzzy but is kind and considerate in her own way.If everything goes smoothly, you are probably going to be ok. It hardly ever goes smoothly.... Consider other doctors and clinics as well.Be proactive and ask as many questions as possible. Have an idea of what you want to do. Dr Williams will give you his suggestion for the highest chance of results but the decision is yours.She really truly cares but you need to be a strong advocate for yourself. Make an appointment with him ASAP. Dr. McConnell is knowledgeable so do not be afraid to ask as many questions as you need.Dr. Rudick is great if you are looking for a warm, friendly and communicative doctor. She gets to know you as a person and you never feel like a number.Trust her.Check out some of the other doctors available at the clinicShe truly understands all aspects of IVFShe's the best. Doesnt sugar coat things, but has a nice approach. Perhaps things would be different at a different facility but if you don't mind  not having much direct contact with your doctor, go for it. If you do, go somewhere else. My friend had a great experience here but it was not a good fit for me. Ask as many questions as possible He is excellent. I had no complaints. Trust that she's very smart and do not be afraid to ask lots of questions. No question is too small or insignificant.Make sure you get to see him each appointment and not his colleagues Don't be afraid to voice your specific fears, concerns, and needsYou have to have patience with the staff. The best Don't be afraid to ask her to repeat herself or clarify somethingDon't expect to be treated by her 100% of the time.It is a group practice and will see everyone and not just him. The whole practice is very competent Have faith and don't waste any more time, just go and meet Dr.Forman!Have a clear understanding of which office you will be able to commit to visiting. Dr. McConnell works in Westchester and NYC. Pick a location that is convenient for you because you'll be visiting the office often. The Columbia Clinic is using cutting edge technology thus I would trust his treatment Make sure you write down everything and ask a lot of questions! She is a wealth of knowledge and very patient.Trust her, completely, even when you think that you would do things differently!Have all past medical information available.Do not expect to see a lot of Dr. Rudick after initial consultation, since monitoring appointments are with any available provider during the time slot you were allotted.  This is simply the model of the clinic, which was not something I was aware of in advance.  I got used to it after a few visits, but wish I knew to expect different providers all the time. Be patient and try and relax - allow Dr. Forman to guide the process.Ask any questions or concerns, and she will make sure that you are comfortable with treatment options. She is also clear about what may or may not work, but always explains all the available options for you to ultimately decide.Dr. Brady is great and you will love her! Just understand for monitoring hours you often won't see her.  My one regret is not asking more questions early on about the actual process day by day, and having an understanding that for morning monitoring you don't always see your doctor.  You see whomever is covering morning monitoring that day.  Book an appointment with her if you are struggling to conceive!Listen to her! She definitely knows what she's talking about!Trust her!His nurses and staff could be more responsive. Listen to any and all advice Dr. Brady has for you.  Even if your timeline of becoming a parent gets thrown off for some reason, you can wholeheartedly trust what she decides to do because she always has your best interest in mind and she also considers all possibilities to ensure you will successfully become a parent one day.Write down all the questions you need answers to before consultation/visit. She will answer your questions.Ask him everything. He is extremely knowledgeable and can give you as many detail as you want but won't overwhelm you with jargon if that's not your speed.When I first met Dr Rudick, I wasn’t 100% sure about her.  I felt like she came off as slightly condescending.  Working with her longer though I realized that it wasn’t really her talking down to us - getting started with fertility treatments, there is an incredible deluge of information thrown at you.  Even if you feel like you’ve done your research and have an idea of how everything works, actually going to the clinic for your consult can be overwhelming.  A year later, I am pregnant and love Dr Rudick’s frank and honest approach of laying out all of the information without sugar coating.  If you want the best experience with treatment and success in conceiving, he is the physician you want to see and his colleagues.Do not hesitate to email her directly or to ask questions.Nothing really, she was great.She’s very caring and helpful. Don't hesitate to ask questions. She's busy and knows what she's doing, but will absolutely take the time to explain if you ask. ",8.300000000000006,8.399999999999995,"I would tell her that she is in good hands, to trust the process, and to ask a lot of questions to ease anxiety and understand all of the details and risks. Every doctor wants to paint the most optimistic picture possible so I think it's important to ask about the worst outcomes too so you can prepare yourself and not be overly disappointed. She is super informative, but you will not see her during visits. Fertility treatment is a highly complex topic and Dr. Forman knows a lot and is always there to answer questions so ask anything you feel uncertain about!"
2,Columbia University,nurse,"Jenn is wonderful to work with. She was so quick via phone and email and was completely on top of my care. She would tell me she was going to call and remind me for certain things (like stop birth control pre treatment) and she always called for the reminder. She is very compassionate and professional. She was helpful but sometimes takes a while to call you back or respond to questions.My nurse was very on top of my care, and a very efficient communicator The staff is awesome. My primary care team was always accessible, got answers for me fast and were incredibly friendly. I had Katrina and Tiffany as nurses. They did their jobs well. 
Even the nurses who draw blood exhibited a great standard of care. Peri, the Egg Donor Program Coordinator, is especially great. She was incredibly helpful and reliable.

Nurse Christine is amazing. She always delivers the results by phone or email as soon as it becomes available.  She is also available to answer any questions or concerns, if not she usually gets back to you as soon as she can.Katrina is outstanding.  She follow-ups on every question and on any concerns. you might have.   Dr. Brady's entire team is quite exception and definitely are a BIG part of her success.  They make the experience with this fertility center well worth it.Nurses were both knowledgeable and compassionate. I think a big strength in this second cycle was that the nurses switched to primarily e-mail based communication instead of phone calls. This was much more efficient and also gives the opportunity for nervous patients like myself to confirm details by referring to the e-mail later. The care staff has been great. The nurses I have been working with (Julissa and Katherine(?)) are both super compassionate lovely people. I really liked my nurse Tiffany. She was always responsive, sincere and communicated to me who her coverage was when she wasn’t in the office. The coordinator was not always consistent as I think they had turnover in this role quite a bit when I was there. The nurse team was better  The care coordinator called a week before our first appointment to make sure that we submit our new patient questionnaire ahead of time, so that Dr. Forman would have the time to review our case before meeting with us. The nurse, Christine, was very helpful, providing us with a checklist of additional diagnostic tests required and talking us through the advantages and disadvantages of genetic testing. The nurse who took our blood was very diligent, competent, and friendly.They are very kind and thorough and answer all of my millions of questions;Pam, the most senior staffer, gave us very detailed training. I deeply appreciate advice to avoid google searches, and not to make any guesses. I believe most of us like to read, analyze and formulate questions; Pam pointed out that operating from assumptions won’t do us any good.  She encouraged us to directly ask the doctor. She was fine but again wasn't helpful during the miscarriage.  Nurse and doctor not on the same page and led to more upsetmentChristine was amazing. Always answered questions, was kind in person and via email, super helpful. Gertrude was our coordinator and she was also excellent. Julissa is always there to answer questions via email. And they were super thorough when explaining how to administer shots to make sure we knew what we were doing. They become your new best friends!The nursing staff is amazing and very communicate and get back to you very quickly My Patient Care Coordinator was very professional and very thorough. She took care of every need or request. Every call got returned and every email was responded to. All in very timely fashion. 
 
Everyone from the front desk receptionists to the nursing/lab staff was simply delightful. Always professional & uplifting. 
This was the best team of medical staff I have been around in a long time. My nurse met with me a few times to sign paperwork and show me how to use the medications. Dr Brady’s staff always got back to me right away when I needed something.Katrina was very thorough, however there is a disconnect between the treatment costs that she gave me and the costs that the billing department provided.  She was completely unaware of the ""package"" that Columbia has been advertising.All the nurses at this clinic are great. Caring and kind. Angela was amazing- knowledgeable, kind, considerate, and informative.The nurse held my hand and was very comforting.The staff was polite and very concise in follow up emails. I am big on followup and recaps to visits and they did a wonderful job laying everything out for me with instructions on my treatment and how to take my medication. All the staff at the CU Fertility Center were professional and kind, very supportive and understanding of the difficult stages I was going throughMelissa was wonderful, sensitive and thorough.My nurse coordinator replied with results via email in a timely manner but in general was all business. I was okay with this but I can see how some patients would prefer a more gentle bedside manner. Very quick and thorough in communication! Everyone I encountered at Columbia Fertility was great. They made what was a difficult process for me (I have breast cancer and never would have otherwise been there seeking their services) easy and as painless as possible.Julissa and the nursing staff were very organized and pleasant to work with. Julissa always called me and/or emailed me with results around the same time of day, the day after testing. This was very consistent and eased my mind, because I knew when to expect to hear from her. I felt that I could reach out to her if I had any questions about medications, treatments, etc. When I started my first IVF cycle, Julissa met with me and showed me how to mix and administer each medication, and gave me tips on how to organize the meds and make it easy. She also sent me links to instructional videos online. The information was very helpful and eased my anxiety. I also got to know the phlebotomists; they were always nice and would greet me and say hello when they saw me. I felt like everyone was rooting for me.Christine and Gertrude are also amazing people. Christine is always so happy and positive. She constantly returned my phone calls to answer all my questions and keep me calm. I can’t say enough good things about these two women. They’re super respectful, professional, and compassionate with patients.The nurses explained the instructions well both verbally and through email. They were responsive to any questions I had. The care coordinator was amazing. But there were many mistakes and anxious moments from mishaps due to miscommunication between them. A lot of mishaps My primary nurse is Christine Helbo. She has been a great help--responsive and dealt with issues with the pharmacy in a timely way to make sure there was no interruption of my medication protocol. 
My care coordinator Gertrude Wilfred was professional and compassionate. Very well organized, and kept everything running smoothly.
The rest of the staff--nurses, doctors, phlebotomists, technicians--were all very professional, helpful, and kind.I    can't possibly say enough wonderful things about Julissa Mota and the coordinating staff who work with Dr. Rudick. They are incredible communicators, very organized and super compassionate. It has been such a pleasure to feel their presence on this journey. She followed up on daily monitoring and briefed us about the ongoing process and next steps and would convey directions of the doctor. She was easily accessible.The nursing staff at Columbia were excellent. I was particularly fond of Isabelle, the IVF nurse. She was incredibly competent and made me feel like I was in good hands. She was also very kind and I felt like I knew her better than the other nurses in the practice. Varda was kind and supportive. Her email communications were not always intelligible but she was always happy to jump on the phone and clarify. Everyone at Columbia was extremely friendly and compassionate, from the front desk receptionists to the technicians taking blood, to the nurses and care coordinators. Varda was very personable and sweet. At times she was a little difficult to follow. Her emails sometimes contained typos or odd sentence structure which required follow up phone calls to make sure I understood what she was talking about. She was always available for clarifications. Nurse and care coordinator are efficient but kind
The nursing staff is extremely efficient and professional but very kind and friendly. Nursing staff was attentive, organized and never made me feel like a ""number"" . Even something as routine as getting my blood drawn over and over, they always referred to my by name, complimented me, asked me personal questions, and gave me tips / tricks to make my blood drawing experience more enjoyable (which I always appreciated because I was usually tense!)The staff at the office were very nice. I found it much easier to communicate with my nurse via email and would receive responses within 24 hours.Karen was my nurse until she left just recently. She always provided very clear instructions and seemed very caring. Her replacement seems a little less warm and less clear about instructions but I will see how she does moving forward. Like Dr Forman himself, Christine becomes a bit more available when you decide to do IVF. she is very sweet and compassionate, but can sometimes be hard to chase down The entire stuff was always helpful. Everyone was on point I didn’t have to remind or explain anything to anyone. It felt like everything was done for me. No stress no confusion. All my emails and questions were answered in a timely manner. They were very compassionate and quick to share results. They also responded quickly to any questions/concerns sent via email. I was assigned Nurse Katrina as my care coordinator and she was great. She would always return my calls quickly and was very helpful with any questions I had during the process. All the nursing staff I encountered at this office was great. Julissa Mota was phenomenal with me! She was very kind and understanding during my whole process at the facility. Julissa also speaks Spanish which is my mother tongue language, and that made it easy for me to communicate with her. Julissa was very responsive with emails and phone calls. She was great in following up with me in a great timely manner and kept me in the loop about my test results and next steps.

The whole nursing team was super nice and empathic during my visits at the clinic. They always tried to life my spirits, which I appreciated. 

Also, the Front Desk team that worked during the weekdays are super nice with patients and are always in a great mood. They are very proactive and kind. The nursing team is great, they´re efficient, they make you feel safe and at ease. Christine was my nurse and care coordinator and she was great. She always followed up with my instructions on time and was very prompt with answering all my questions and putting in medication requests. Christine was a delight to work with. Very communicative throughout the process and kind during our many visits!They are very willing to speak to us especially by email which I appreciated. When trying to reach by phone that is very difficult of you miss the call and have to call them back. Lots on phone tag. But I am fingind email best. I wish that I had access to results and more explanation on interpretation. However the portal does not provide this so that you have to request results more easily when in the office itself. Once they write the instructions down it became more easily understood otherwise I found the info jumbled. So I appreciated written and a call. I was emailed but missed the time sensitive email. This I almost missed a months schedule from this miscommunication so I would have appreciated receiving a call to inform me that en email was sent of they hadn’t heard back in 48-72 hours. This is especially for time sensitive matters. 

In general they are a warm and excited staff and that makes a big difference Our nurses Christine Helbo and Melissa Podolak were also amazing. I would always be a nervous wreck at work waiting for my BHCG blood results but they always emailed me back so quickly so I wouldn’t have to be nervous all day!The nursing staff was good but could definitely improve only by paying closer attention to detail sometimes and being a bit more proactive. For example, as we waited for PGS testing results, it was around the holidays and things took longer than usual. I would have loved to get an update more proactively to manage my expectations about how long it would take. Varda was great. Very matter of fact, but also very empathetic. I felt like I had access to her via email and phone (during office hours) and could count on her to get me whatever information I was looking for.  Christine was amazing! My interaction with her was primarily via email and she was incredibly responsive and helpful with all my questions.Laura is a wonderful RN with a very pleasant personality, she is responsive, understanding and gets things done swiftly. Laura is a excellent communicator  between you and your doctor. Her smile is pure sun shine !Laura was always there for us, if we had any questions we knew that we can rely on Laura.Laura was thorough and positive from the beginning.  Like Dr. Williams,  her approach to her role was more of an ally than a nurse.  I felt that with each positive result, she was cheering us on!Laura was a great liaison between us and Dr. Williams. She was always the one to call us with results, and she made sure that we understood each step of our protocol. She was the one that we reached out to whenever a question came up, and she was never more than a phone call or email away... and always with a smile!The nursing staff was amazing. They communicated well and were very pleasant. Chrissy and Angela are both wonderful nurses.  They are both extremely knowledgeable and personable.Everyone on the team was helpful, easy to get in touch with and compassionate. There is always communication with me, she would email me about new medication and results. Also the care coordinator is really helpful all my questions are answered and its very easy to have appointment done.She was super professional but no bedside manner what so ever. Overall you have to be your own advocate and stay on top of your care coordinator, the financial person and your nurse for results. The lack of clear communication can at times be frustrating. The nursing staff is excellent! Between my nurse Karen and the entire nursing staff, I was always emailed promptly with my results/next steps and had all my questions answered. 
The nursing staff is excellent. My nurse, Karen, always calls promptly with my results and answers any questions I have. My care coordinator was super incredible. When I called and burst out crying she took the time to talk to me and calm me down. She called me two days later just to check up and see how I'm doing even though my nurse already called me. The care coordinator Adina and nurse Julissa were both extremely responsive and kind. I was assigned a Primary Nurse and a care coordinator.  I was contacted most often by a different nurse.  The entire staff is fine.  They are not at all coordinated, which has made follow through more difficult.The nurses were all wonderful except for one that was very rude (and very pregnant, which was salt in the wound). The majority are lovely though. They were busy but they always knew your name and what was happening with you.I love the nursing staff at Columbia. Everyone is compassionate and professional and knowledgeableWe had a scheduling snafu with a sample that should have been frozen instead of tested. Generally the nursing staff is so caring and reassuring, knowledgeable and prompt. I was amazed how fast I received a call back after hours!They are compassionate and sweet. They always explain everything thoroughly.They are smart, responsive, and helpfulI just would have liked them to follow up more and offer options if IVF isn’t affordable.  They have sent me all the forms and documents needed. As well as they showed me what my plan coversThey are all so sweet and caring. They follow up and have lots of patience.My nurse was great about communication via email and on behalf of Dr. Rudick.  She always followed up with me within a few hours of my monitoring appointments to let me know next steps.  She called when topics were more complex or if I had questions.  I never actually made Julissa in person but didn't really mind. Christine is amazing. I started with Tiffany who was equally fantastic, but Christine came on board after working with Dr. Forman for 4 years at a previous practice. If that doesn't speak for itself, what does?

Christine also gave me the best advice - she told me to try and sit back and let the experts manage the process. For a Type A person, it was a lightbulb moment and did in fact result in a positive pregnancy test (followed by a miscarriage). But nonetheless, it's a mantra I try and hold on to each and every step of the way.Dr. Brady's team including nurses and care and financial coordinators were caring and efficient in email and phone communication. The in-person training on how to administer subcutaneous injections for the IVF cycle was very helpful as well.Everyone communicated well via email and I always knew in the afternoon after each appointment what my next steps are.  My one issue I would suggest is (nurses at the practice) taking time to meet your new patients in person at the start of the journey so its not just an email relationship.  I do wish someone sat down with me and went over the medication and what the schedule for the cycle would look like, versus just sending video tutorials via email.  Katrina (as well as Madison) were great communicators.  They always responded promptly to questions.  Katrina sat down with me and taught me how to do the injections and sent me online videos as well.  She was wonderful!The staff was great - responsive and helpful.All of the staff was so warm, caring and helpful!
Laura was really non-responsive. I felt her hours were very limited in a way that made things move slower. When I did get through to her she didn't seem to know a lot about my case. She didn't seem to have the ability (or motivation?) to move my case forward during initial diagnostics and testing at the pace and in the efficient manner that I would have preferred. I had to get very involved to make sure certain labs got the requests and paperwork that were needed. I think this inefficiency ended up adding a few weeks to a month between certain tests and delayed my case because of certain errors and failures to properly fill out paperwork. At a time where every day counts in a woman's mind who is trying to conceive later in life, responsiveness and efficiency should be given more attention and people without the motivation to advocate for themselves could really be held back by this issue. The nursing staff at Columbia always acts very upbeat, kind, and friendly.  They are always super supportive which is helpful since infertility is very draining.My nurse is efficient in communicating information regarding my care. She responds in a timely manner to my emails. The is reassuring and professional. I truly believe she has my care in her best interest even though it is the doctor who makes decisions.Wonderful! Jenny did a lot of my blood draws and gave me such comfort during those 7 a.m. needle in the arm appointments (and also never left a bruise). 
Christine and Tiffany did a lot of the communication about medication and appointments and were clear and prompt.Julissa was lovely and very kind.  She would call or email me with results after every test and had a very clear communication style when it came to the intricacies of the IVF stimulation protocol which is quite complicated and nonsensical for a first timer.  The two nurses who drawl blood were wonderful.  They helped me get over a lifelong fear of needles that I thought would prevent me from doing IVF all-together.    Laura Lodico, RN is an amazing nurse who works extremely well with Dr. Zev Williams and the team at CURC.  Laura was very attentive to my questions and concerns and got back to me with answers immediately.  She always followed up with lab results immediately when it is available and always checked in after treatment to see how I was feeling.  She made me feel very special.Loved all the staff at Columbia University Fertility. They were very helpful and compassionate. From the very first step of receiving information to the end of my process, Sherry and Varda, truly made me feel very comfortable and made the journey much easier. Excellent",8.300000000000006,8.399999999999995,"She was so quick via phone and email and was completely on top of my care.

I    can't possibly say enough wonderful things about Julissa Mota and the coordinating staff who work with Dr. Rudick. Laura is a excellent communicator  between you and your doctor."
3,Columbia University,clinic,"The second IUI I had was done with two male doctors (I don't remember names) and it took them 20 minutes with both of them between my legs trying to do it.  The whole experience was traumatizing and the reason why I never went back.  Separately, I saw another older male doctor for an exam/check-up and he was very condescending and unnecessarily defensive (he clearly had a chip on his shoulder, even though I don't believe I said anything to provoke this).  Because of these three male doctors that I saw (I don't remember any of their names anymore and don't want to guess and make a mistake), I would not go back to this clinic again.  If I could only see Dr. Choi, I would.  This is not an option, though, because it is written clearly in their paperwork that you see the doctor that is there and available.
Pamela was one nurse who went above and beyond for us in every way. We are so grateful. The clinic is busy and big and she made us feel cared for. Their billing department is terrible and very rude. Make copies of everything. It takes forever to get through on thier phone line and I was consantly trying to get information, they don't tell you anything utill you owe them money Columbia is an excellent clinic, and would be a good fit for people who respond well to the standard protocols. They were very personable, responsive, accomodating, and knowledgeable. Very friendly and dedicated, hard workers. Fast knowledgeable warm caring encouraging I was not happy with their responsiveness. If i had a question about my treatment it would take 2-3 days to get a call back, and sometimes I never got a call back.  

They also did not communicate clear instructions with IUI and it was very stressful.They screwed up constantly, particularly when it came to prescriptions and drug ordering. They cost us several thousand dollars out of pocket unnecessarily.It felt like a factory. Please see previous comment about the buzzers and seeing different doctors every time. Perhaps that belonged here instead. I really only worked with Dr. Forman, who is amazing. I had some trouble with the clinic's financial office. They were not very responsive and it took me a long time to adjust my balances. I don't really remember the nursing team which I guess means they were fine. The phlebotomists were very nice and always greeted me with a smile. The front desk staff was also very kind. I don't remember well and things have changed now but at the time things seemed a bit disorganized, lots of waiting and confusion. It's huge and busy. I liked some of the doctors more than others and you even up seeing most/all of them. One of the doctors made a very scary suggestion without having all of my information--luckily I was informed. They were kind and kept things upbeat, which was good since they were taking my blood seemingly every other minute.There was no personal connectionThe office is very nice and in a convenient location near Columbus Circle. All of the staff is nice and helpful when asked but no extra information is given which often leaves me with questions. I find I really have to go out of the way to ask extra questions about my treatment and next steps. Columbia has changed their procedures within the time that I've been with them. It has been night and day! So much better!  I am typically in and out of morning monitoring within one hour at the longest.  Their new billing system is extremely organized and I like how they assign a billing person to each patient for direct communication. They also provide additional services such as a support group which I found helpful as wellThey not what they are doing. The needle pricks are to a minimum and they do a better job than most hospital nurses. This clinic had a clear plan they followed for making sure you had instructions and understood your next steps.The clinic is efficient and kind. Dr. McConnell, Karen, Chrissy, and Angela are my heroes. They are competent and caring. They make my experience at the clinic  so much more manageable and stress-free. Thank you. It's impossible to get a nurse on the phone.  You have to leave a message & hope they call you back the same day.  Unnecessary stress if you ask me.  They were very experienced I don't have enough words to express my gratitude for Dr. Eric Forman and his staff at Columbia University Fertility under his lead.  The staff is very kind, welcoming and very professional.  From the receptionist to the doctors, nurses and all the way to the last person in the Lab you will encounter only wonderful people.  It is like God had handpicked this team.  As for the Dr. Forman, well... he is definitely a godsend!  He is the kindest doctor you will ever meet.  What makes him special - apart from his experience and knowledge in the field along with his high successful fertility rate, is his availability and willingness to kindly answer all your questions (good, bad or just silly) thru all channels possible (email, phones, sms, face-to-face, etc.).  Dr. Forman made both my husband and I feel safe, secure and in good hands.  Dr. Forman and his staff are so friendly they felt like extended family.  During our vacation overseas, Dr. Forman kept monitoring my test results over there and was in constant contact with us, day and night, even though there was a big time difference.  Prior to coming to Columbia University Fertility center, I tried two clinics before.  However, out of all, I recommend you Columbia Fertility center and Dr. Forman from all my heart!  Have faith and go meet Dr. Forman at Columbia Fertility!The clinic runs very efficiently. Everyone is enthusiastic and kind, from the front desk to the nurses. Morning monitoring goes quickly; visits never ran over time/late. All the physicians I met were attentive and kind as well.The clinic is run really efficiently. I never waited more than 5/10 minutes. Appointment times were easy to get and everyone from front desk, to nurses to doctors were incredibly nice and caring. 

The financial counselors were also incredible. They worked directly with my insurance and I really had very little to do on my own. They really know what they're doing and in an environment where timing is everything, they get it done. 


I can't recommend this clinic enough. The only things that I would hope for other to avoid are things that they can't necessarily control. 1) Make sure your procedures are pre-authorized well in advance. Speak with your insurance yourself and know for sure that pre-autho went through. 2) One of the third party companies that they work with, Igenomix that is used for PGS testing, relies on your IVF doctor to explain things that I believe should be their responsibility. The only thing that the clinic can do to help avoid a lot of frustration when it comes to finding out your results from Igenomix is to explain to their patients that 1) Currently, NY state law does not does not allow companies like Igenomix to disclose mosaic results 2) Explain that mosaic results from Igenomix are handled differently and how. 3) Interpret the results from Igenomix completely for the patient before they try to do it for themselves with an Igenomix rep.
Again, all things that I believe Igonmix should explain before someone uses their services considering it has to do with their results and the service that your paying them to do, not the clinic. Igenomix should be saying, “You should know that that NY State law prevents us from disclosing information about mosaics…”, “this is how we outline our results. we conclude mosaic embryos are also abnormal embryos so you wouldn’t use them anyway… (paraphrasing that last part… that’s not exactly right)..”, “This is how you interpret our results, here is an example”.
Overall, Columbia fertility is a wonderful place. As you exit the elevator you are greeted with friendly smiles from the front desk employees which makes you feel welcome. The office is bright, clean, and comfortable with complimentary refreshments. The wait time to be seen is very short. The strengths include their coordination.  I never experienced a long wait with any appointment.  They are punctual and efficient. Some are friendlier than others but all are professionals.  The weaknesses for me include the front desk:  If a patient completes the electronic check-in why do they still have to provide their information again in this open setting. One representative is always friendly but the other not so much.  She often seems annoyed.  The other weakness is often feeling like just a number.  I understand that they have a lot of patients but the experience is very individual. Having your dream realized should not be greeted with a certain layer of coldness and commonality when it is anything but that.The nurses are always kind and always seem to put my nerves at ease.This clinic is EFFICIENT! But does so without losing the personal experience. Seeing consistent staff is really comforting, including front desk, phlebotomists, and sonographers. All staff were consistently warm and professional. Also they are VERY on top of patient identification and labeling. I was ALWAYS asked to confirm name and DOB at every step. I'm still in the beginning stages, so I had only one blood draw so far. The nurse was thoughtful in asking me if I wanted to lie down (before even knowing if I was sensitive to having blood drawn). There was a bit of a clarification needed about which tests I was taking, but that issue/miscommunication wasn't the fault of the nurses.Columbia has a great new office in the same building that they were in but in the penthouse now. The place is soothing, clean, and nice to wait in. The wait times have drastically decreased. The morning appointments are super fast. They are quite organized, I've just seen a bit of line once. The front desk women are lovely. Always smiling and supportive. Overall my experiences there have been good. Hope it stays that way. Because this is affiliated with Columbia the billing dept is massive and at times very confusing if you speak to the general hospital staff. I would recommend only speaking to the fertility center billing department to avoid confusion.Conceptions Florida is a very busy clinic but everyone in the medical team is very attentive and responsive. I did 2 cycles of egg freezing and both times the experience was good.  The billing/accounting department, however, was not as clear and responsive as the doctors. The practice administrator at the time (2018) was not very responsive.  I always had to email her several times before getting a response from her. The nurses were great, I was always seen quickly.It's a zoo in there. They barely have time to remember people except for 2 nurses who were above average.  The clinic actively takes part in research performed at Columbia University, which means that it remains at the forefront of the field. Treatments provided are state-of-the-art. Besides the expertise, sensitivity and kindness of the staff, the clinic facilities provide a welcoming surrounding.I am so glad that I chose to use Columbia when my husband and I struggled to conceive. Dr. McConnell is brilliant and also kind and comforting throughout what can be a very anxiety-producing process. She is patient with me and answers all of my questions, and I never feel rushed. I mainly see her in the Westchester office, but I have been to the new Manhattan location as well and it's amazing!! I had an appointment with Dr. Forman once when Dr. McConnell was out of the office and he seemed great as well. The process of scheduling appointments is seamless, and I adore all of the nurses, secretaries, and phlebotomists I have interacted with.IVF is a very stressful process, especially when we are using extensive hormones, which could easily make our feeling and emotions swing and tiny little bit of discomfort occurred to us could trigger a big drama.

Having gone through numerous consultations and IVF treatments over the past 4 years, The Center For Women's at Columbia University Medical Center has worked best for me. 

Columbia provides many opportunities to communicate with your own doctor. Most of the time, it’s your own doctor provides the ultrasound, so you know the status.  

Dr. Rudick impressed me early on as being both intelligent and attentive.  She is very thorough and very quick to get what’s on my mind. She made me feel positive and gave me confidence. 

The process of drawing blood can be uncomfortable, but the staff at Columbia were friendly and compassionate. I love Arula. She made my day when she successfully drew the blood in one shot from my hard-to find vein.  Jenny is very patient. Patrice is always smiling and sometimes she does it herself, despite being the lead nurse who assigns tasks. Pam, the most senior staffer, gave us very detailed training. I deeply appreciate advice to avoid google searches, and not to make any guesses. I believe most of us like to read, analyze and formulate questions; Pam pointed out that operating from assumptions won’t do us any good.  She encouraged us to directly ask the doctor. 

The administrative staff is also great, particularly Sofia. She has a passion for her work, despite being relatively new. She takes everything seriously and is focused on the tasks at hand.  Without her help, I won’t be so fortunate. 

The last item I want to mention is the billing department; they made difficult issues very simple.  I am able to match their bills with my insurance EOB’s. If I came across any discrepancies, Miriam provided a detailed explanation and an immediate fix.  This is in sharp contrast to prior experiences, in which the bills were tough to decipher and help was not consistent.  

They were all very nice and they seem to know what they were all doing. They also know your name. They give you privacy. They confirm your name and birthdate. I would say it has gotten better. I'm a little unsure of the difference between the nursing staff vs. the medical assistants/phlebotomists. I'm fairly confident I've only come in contact with 3 actual nurses. They were all very nice. The medical assistants and phlebotomists are pretty terrible. The call the first name and last initial for you to do blood work. I thought the woman was calling my name so I said are you saying ""first last"" and she just kept repeating what she was saying and not answering my question. Once we got back there she said ""we only say the first name and last name initial"" which is totally fine but answer when i tell you my full name. Also, my rubella immunity came back low. I got the booster (and had to sit that cycle out). Two months later they call me back and ask me if I got it. I told them the date I received the booster and said I thought the record should be in my file but could have the doctor's office resend it. Then they went back and forth about whether they needed to draw my blood to test for it again. They were basically asking me if they should. I told them ""I got the booster so if I'm not immune at this point there is nothing I can do and I'll have to take my chances. But if you need the blood test for me to continue with my treatment plan then do it."" It just felt like they had no idea what was going on. I feel like when you go in you have to already know what should be happening or you might get extra blood drawn or unnecessary ultrasounds. If insurance wasn't covering my treatment I would be really concerned about the confusion if I was the one paying for all these tests. I can remember only 2 individuals who were our lifelines during our treatment there. 1) Michael worked the front desk and was always friendly, kind and efficient. 2) Erica was a blood tech there and is now at Sher NY. She was always friendly and efficient - uplifting and important qualities to help patients navigate this stressful time.The nurse telephone line goes directly to voicemail. That is fine. The problem is, their voicemail numbers don't match the correct nurses with their corresponding doctors. I mentioned this several times and was met with deaf ears. Also, I would receive a call back only 80% of the time from the nurse. In one instance, I called 5 times over the course of 3 days pleading with them to call me back as my prescription hadn't been called in correctly. I never received any reply. I'm still waiting for that call back (haha!) Nurses and staff do what they are supposed to but without explaining why. 
Waiting time on average was 2 to 3 hours. But sometimes 4 hours. 
For one nurse it took 10 minutes to draw blood.  She was not schooled at assembling the equipment so she wasted 6 needles before she got it right.  I don't believe she had a proper schooling.  Other nurses were just ok.   
The only real weakness is that for the check-ins with the bloodwork/ultrasounds you are not likely to see your physician, which isn't preferable as I would have liked my physician to be the one doing the ultrasound check-ins. The support staff including the nurses were really nice but overworked and unorganized. I was frequently given misinformation and strange instructions by the nurses. One told me to avoid yoga/light exercise even before my frozen transfer because it would bounce my uterus!Some were more informative, friendly and patient than others but all were relatively warmThey were all kind. They seemed knowledgeable and understanding.Its a faceless factory, so there isnt a concept of a specific nurse you work with. Operated like a factory due to the number of patients in the waiting room at any given time.  But it was necessary to maintain a constant flow of moving patients . They only called u by ur first name to maintain privacy . There was never a long wait from when u were called to when the dr arrived. I do think they need to change the billing window procedure. There’s not enough privacy there was usually a long wait; the wait was shorter in the westchester officeAlthough I saw different nurses, I felt That they all were efficient and communicated well what was expected. Many of them were friendly and would remember their patients.The nurses were not helpful or nice.  Total factory.  You could wait on hold forever just to leave a message for someone to maybe call you back.  The nurses are only available until 4 or 4.30 pm.It really depended on the nurse!  Some were very kind and caring, some were quiet and a little cold.  They were all competant.  Again, this whole clinic felt like a factory. People were nice enough but I might as well have been a cardboard cut-out. Nothing felt personal at all. Efficiency. they are organized.  no surprises with prices.  Communication is ok.  I was a month behind bc no one told me that the lab was closing for maintenance.  you will not see your Doctor at every visit.  Possible that will not do any of the procedures either.  They are really just reviewing the case.  Beautiful and clean place. Organized. Location was convenient and easy to find, even for someone not local to the area. Staff always had a smile and was kind to me and my husband. We had a good feeling about Columbia from the very first visit. It’s amazing. No wait time. No problem scheduling at the times I want to come in. Absolutely zero stress which is really important when going through something like this. The phlebotomists are also amazing and never had an issue getting my blood drawn. The clinic is very big and they see lots of people on a daily basis.  The front desk ladies are so friendly and really help you to feel comfortable when you arrive.  Their appt always run in time and work very efficiently.  Everyone in general is super friendly and helpful.They were kind and respectful. We were not happy with the nurse that was assigned to us during the first treatment cycle, but all the nurses we worked with later on were wonderful.Columbia University was recently rebranded and they moved to a beautiful penthouse office! Its a relaxing environment and convenient location! They are open really early and accommodating for blood tests and ultrasounds with no real delays which is incredibly valuable given the number of times you have to go for monitoring especially if you are working full time.I was very happy they were able to give me the information I needed and when they were unsure they were able to get an answer from my doctor fairly quickly. This is a very very busy practice but all the staff is top notch. Nurses are compassionate, very organized and always got back to me within the promised timeframe. It's very difficult to reach them via the phone, and when you do and ask a question, its hard to get a response. In person I found the staff to always be professional and competent. Disorganized. They didn't respond to frantic emails and calls for information I needed to order sperm. The nurse assigned to me simply never responded. I had to hound other nurses to get the information I needed. I didn't even know fully what all tests I had to do until I cornered someone.Again I was there sometimes twice a week.  The nursing staff isn't large.  I was constantly telling them how to pronounce my name and I really don't want to see yawns and food on scrubs while i'm having my blood drawn.The nursing staff were kind, reassuring, and kept us in the loop.  They were supportive and positive.Some were less compassionate than others. The clinic is amazing they have all the facilities and great infrastructure and all the doctors and staff are amazing. They make sure that the patient is comfortable during the entire treatment process and every doctor communicates fully with you. Beautiful place with great atmosphere and wonderful staff!
Each and every person I came across was courteous, professional, and made my visit as comfortable as they possibly could. 

Weekend hours for lab and monitoring is a great plus. The clinic is new and beautiful. It runs pretty well and I usually did not have to wait long for testing. The staff are friendly and helpful. Their blood drawing is the best! I felt comfortable throughout everything, and confident with Dr Brady’s care. The nurses were nice and communicated well. They dealt with me in a compassionate way. I enjoyed working with them. They all made the whole process a little easier. Columbia has a lot of patients so it can feel like a factory. I have recently started going in for treatment again for a second child and things are definitely better, a lot more organized and waiting times have decreased considerably. Long waits and disorganized, never answers the phone.  They will call you back when you leave messages, but the communication feels more like a free clinic than an established facility.  The lobby is clean, but the actual exam rooms and offices are old.The clinic has gotten a lot better. It used to feel like a cattle call but they are much better at getting you in and out of morning monitoring now and have a much nicer office environment. They also have a location in Westchester for morning monitoring that is a quick and easy drive if you live outside of Manhattan. The best run clinic we attended.  We never waited more than 15 minutes for any visit.  The organization was impeccable.  If we were there only for blood, we were in and out.  If we had to see the doctor, the whole visit may have taken 45 minutes to an hour.
Friendly and well trained and knowledgeable I did not love all the dr at Columbia. Sounds sexist, but the men I saw, especially the one that told me my pregnancy wasnt viable did not have a compassionate side. Found him to be really cold and rude. It was a flurry of different faces but there was one I saw a few times and she was very kind, sadly I can't recall her name. Not helpfulBilling department is not good.  You have to double check everything. I had to wait 6 weeks for a pre approval that only takes one day to do.Great individuals working at the clinic. nurses are probably the weakest link at the center. I find them to be disorganized and somewhat rigid. I've had to ask them to explain and repeat themselves to be sure I understood Felt cared for, never rushed through.The strengths are short wait times in the morning and fast visits.  I was in and out within 20 minutes each visit. The weakness would be their afternoon appointments. Those take longer and times may be unpredictable.  Some days were quick and others were long.  CU Fertility Center is a bright, warm place - you enter with all the concerns about the process and a sense of failure and doubt, and you come out reassured and hopeful that something can be done! Doctors and staff are there for you, they make you feel taken care of and considered, and the spaces are simply beautiful and calming.This is the most organized and efficient clinic. Everyone is easy to get ahold of from the doctor to the billing personnel. I feel my care was the highest priority and I was given the attention I needed. I plan to come back to Dr Rudick for all future fertility treatments.For me, the strength was the location and times for scheduling blood draws and procedures and the fact that they accepted my insurance.  It was very convenient while working full-time and was located a few blocks from my office.  Weakness was that it felt like a baby factory sometimes -- it was constantly packed with patients and at times I felt very rushed.  Towards the end of the cycle before I was released, the nurses got to know me and become more friendly and familiar. This clinic has been amazing! They are very helpful and easy to reach. While it can be very crowded on the weekend for morning monitoring, during the week monitoring goes very quickly and is easy to schedule.Organized, clean, friendly, barely ever waited at all. Even though fertility processes need to run on a strict schedule, I did not feel like a number or statistic while there. Very patient-focused clinic.The clinic has a very calming atmosphere, and is very clean. There are plenty of seats for waiting patients, and several bathrooms. There was always water available and fresh fruit.
The reception staff was very pleasant each time I arrived and check in was quick. The process during morning monitoring was consistent, and I hardly ever had to wait more than 5-10 minutes after my scheduled appointment time to be seen.Columbia is gorgeous! Everything is clean and everyone when you walk in is friendly and helpful. Every one who ever drew my blood got to know me and made me feel super comfortable. The sonographers were informative and knowledgeable. I was always able to get in contact with someone to answer my question.The facilities at Columbia IVF are clean, well-designed and very organized. The staff including nurses and secretaries are polite and responsive to patients' needs. The physicians I saw at the clinic were excellent both in terms of clinical competence and bedside manner. The embryologists I met were professional and careful in their handling of my embryo from what I saw during my transfer. The nurses who draw blood and morning monitoring are amazing. Sometimes there is a long wait in the am. The coordinators and the doctors personal nursing staff have very poor communication within each other which resulted in a lot of unnecessary anguish and anxiety for both my husband and myself. We had to call the emergency line more than 5 times to get our medication called into the pharmacy. We missed IUIs due to “forgetting” we needed blood work before. The clinic is very well organized. I have heard negative descriptions from former patients, but my experience has been positive. On the whole, I found everything very well run. My only note is that I needed to follow up on prescriptions being called in on time on two occasions. Strengths: flexibility in scheduling, location, hours of operation, incredibly smart staff of nurses and doctors, availability during off-hours.  

Weaknesses: sometimes it was unclear about next steps with insurance The clinic is open even on holidays and weekends and they would never postpone anything scheduled for a given day. The wait time was minimum and staff was very friendly. 
The only small weakness I found was at times, there was a bit long waiting time for the after office hours emergency helpline.This is a very competent clinic, but they could benefit from a bit more organization and better communication. In particular, I would have appreciated more clear details about next steps in my treatment, so that I could set expectations. Also, while I was given a sheet of names and numbers of people to contact, this changed several times throughout my treatment and I was never completely sure who I was supposed to reach out to. I even wrote to them one time expressing my frustration and didn't receive any response -- this was very disappointing, especially considering what a sensitive subject this is.Columbia Fertility is open 365 days a week and has early monitoring hours (7am). The entire staff was friendly and kind. The facilities were new, bright and welcoming. It is easy to get to on public transportation. Their labs come in quickly and you get a phone call or email the same day to tell you results and next steps. The accounts receivables team is also very competent and efficient. When I was confused about a bill, the agent was able to explain it to me so that I understood and then very kindly offered to set me up with a payment plan.  When my husband and I arrived at Columbia University, we were impressed with the offices and suites. It is a bright, clean, and welcoming place. The running of the office is very efficient. You never wait too long for routine blood work and ultrasounds. The hours were convenient (7am appointments). They are also open 365 days a year even on New Year's day. The nurses call or email you with next steps within the day. The medication orders are sent to the specialty pharmacy seamlessly. It's really a wonderful place.  Organized efficient friendly and well run 
The billing department and insurance issues were a bit confusing and I didn’t feel like I had enough support on that end 
I wish I’d get to see my specific dr at visits Very clean, professional, efficient. It's like a beautiful well oiled machine. For first time patients, I would speak up if you have questions about the morning monitoring process! It can be daunting and overwhelming to start fertility treatment, and it is easy to forget what the next step is! They are always a call / email away to help. Its in a new space - spacious and very clean. I always felt comfortable during my visits. If you see a packed waiting room, don't fret, they are very organized and I never waited for monitoring more than 10 minutes. If I were waiting for my doctor that was a bit different and if they were running late they always told me. They communicate all updates in a timely fashion.When I was a new patient, the clinic was just moving to a newly renovated penthouse office in the same building. The new clinic carries all the state-of-the-art equipment and it is a beautiful office. I don't think I would ever leave this clinic. All the doctors are super knowledgeable and professional and the rest of the staff is so friendly and warm. They all know me by name at this point and they seem genuinely interested in talking with me. The office is also very efficient. I never wait very long at all for morning monitoring or procedures. Everything about this place is great and I can't imagine going anywhere else. The clinic itself is clean and comfortable. The environment is one in which you feel comfortable.The only downfall is the morning monitoring. The timing sometimes conflict with my work schedule so if you have to be monitored before work I would suggest arriving as early as possible. They are however willing to accommodate you if you arrive after the monitoring window. The clinic is easily accessible in the city by various meth6 of transportation so finding it isnt a problem.The space is very beautiful and feels high end, which I appreciate since you really do spend so much time there. It’s nice that they have a clean and modern office. The front desk staff had a few hiccups. One of the receptionists had a nervous laugh which always felt insensitive given the gravity of what we’re dealing with. There can be a lot of chatter and giggles at the front desk sometimes, which also feels inappropriate given their surroundings. Sometimes I was told by the doctor or nurse that the front desk would have information that they didn’t and I felt like the front desk would rely on me to know what it was I needed to sign or pay for. I think the staff at the front could use a little extra sensitivity and professionalism training.  We had an amazing experience. First of all the whole place had a positive and light energy. The entire stuff was always smiling. We never had to wait to long or be confused on what's next. After such outstanding level of care and professionalism I decide to switch all my doctors to Columbia doctors!The clinic is beautiful, newly renovated and clean. I usually did not have to wait more than 10 minutes to be seen. The workers at the front desk and friendly and happy to assist with any issues/concerns. I'm still learning to navigate the clinic's system. I think more specific information and follow-up up front would be helpful. I went to a previous clinic for the initial consultation where I was given much more detailed information right from the get-go in terms of logistical matters, and this clinic feels a bit hands off so far, but again, I'm just starting, so perhaps that will change once I'm further into the process.The Columbia Fertility office is awesome! They average length of my morning monitoring appointments was about 20mins which I really appreciated because I can have an appointment at 7 and still get to work by 8. They assigned me a person for financial questions, a nurse care coordinator, and someone to help with pharmacy issues. There was always someone I could ask to get any question answered. They are always friendly and I am on first name basis with a few of the receptionists and phlebotomists. I feel very comfortable there and welcome and really at home there. Even though they have so many patients they really try to make you feel welcome. The facility has an elegant look and is on a private floor. I did like that the office is located in Midtown Manhattan, which makes it easy for many New Yorkers to get there. Also, I like that all emails sent from the facility are secured, and only the Fertility Clinic has access to see your medical records regarding your treatments. Columbia University Fertility Center is absolutely great. The place itself is spacious, full of light, super clean. The staff have everything organized and coordinated perfectly. There can be days (Fridays) when it gets a bit crowded, but, in general, it´s rather calm and respect your times. I am very surprised with their punctuality and how well organized everything is. Overall, we had a great experience at Columbia. 
Strengths: you need to schedule your monitoring appointments, so I never waited too long for my ultrasound/ blood work, the front desk is very friendly and helpful and the clinic is very clean.
Weaknesses: sometimes things can appear a bit disorganized here as they are so busy. They are also very simple and don't have any of the fluff like other clinics like bottled water, snacks, etc. Columbia Fertility is a wonderful practice.  I felt like a dignified, respected patient. It wasn't like some clinics I have heard of where the lobby is always packed like some kind of baby-making factory. Everyone who works at the front desk is happy and helpful. The practice is clean/modern and well run. I wish they would expand the capacity of the portal so that we play less phone tag and increase clear and direct communication. 

Warm staff and a hopeful one which is especially needed during stressful times. I like the ancillary service connections they make too (acupuncture)Clinic is brand new. Beautiful and very calm atmosphere. Lots of light and neutral colors. The exam rooms are clean and they give you actual cotton sheets to cover yourself with - not those paper ones. The receptionists and blood technicians were always friendly and lovely as well!Very easy and convenient from 7-9 am This place was a well oiled machine! Everything was pretty organized and you never really waited that long. After a certain time, you can’t get through to them through the main line. Having your nurses email and direct line is really important. The location was super practical for me with the frequent visits too. Columbia is tricky. I think the staff is wonderful, from the front desk to the phlebotomists to the nurses and doctors. At the same time, I found myself feeling frustrated and lost in the shuffle. If you do not speak up and advocate for yourself, you will likely feel the same.I loved every aspect of the Columbia Fertility clinic. It felt small and personalized without feeling overly exclusive or anything like that. I felt incredibly well taken care of at every step, like people recognized me and cared about ME specifically and were rooting for my success. Very very humanizing.Communication with the financial team has been challenging, it’s frequently hard to get a response even with follow up and we’ve had several issues with invoices. No issues with scheduling or any other administration.Columbia University Medical Center is a nice place, staff is polite and friendly. office looks clean and busy, they offer very flexible appointments the atmosphere is very calm and relaxing, in general I was very satisfied  wit the service I got in Columbia University Medical Center.The Clinic is a well kept and calm environment. The staff is friendly and accommodating. The documents are very organized, prescriptions are sent directly to the pharmacy for on time delivery. It's easy to get in touch with a doctor or nurse, everyone is there to help you and make you feel important.I think the strength of the clinic depends on what doctor you get—Dr. Williams always made you feel like a priority but some of the clinic staff did not seem entirely organized or thorough.  That being said, they were always friendly.  The facilities may not be as nicely furnished or new as other centers, but there is definitely a lot of human talent within the walls.When you walk into Columbia Fertility, there is a sense of calm about the place. It seems as though there was a lot of thought put into the way the space is structured - lots of natural light, open airy spaces, soft music in the background and an overall beautiful decor. There never seemed to be more than 5 or 6 other patients waiting in the waiting room, which made me more comfortable taking the time I needed with my doctor, without having to worry about holding up a waiting room full of angry patients. I had some insurance issues in the beginning, but I found the billing department to be very accommodating, and they did their best to help straighten it out. I must note that when you are trying to reach a nurse or a secretary by phone, there is usually some waiting time, and you do get transferred around a bit which can be frustrating. I also find their online patient portal to be severely lacking - appointment summaries and test results are never posted.It's a money making machine.  There is no customization in terms of adjusting hormones.  You have to go 3 times a week and they must process 50 women within 90 minutes.  You don't see your doctor regularly for ultrasounds or blood work.  We sat down with Dr. Grossman twice throughout the whole process.  The fact that 2 different doctors did our transfers and used 2 different procedures for the transfer confused us.  There should be consistency at least in that area.  The clinic is beautiful, you’re always greeted. They have coffee, tea and water for you while you wait. They even sometimes play relaxing music. The clinic is always clean. The waiting area, the rooms and bathrooms are well kept. They provide anything you need to freshen up.  Strengths:  There is hardly a line when checking in, I never have to wait more than 10 minutes for a bloodwork. And they are all friendly.
Weaknesses:  The clinic can use a little update especially the bathrooms.CWRC definitely had a factory feel because they treat such a high volume of patients, but it’s my understanding that all NYC clinics are like this. I had over 30 appointments at the Manhattan location. This location was very hit or miss in terms of the service received. Sometimes I only waited for 10 minutes for an appointment, and the staff was pleasant, other times there were long waits and the staff was curt and rushed. My worst experience was when I waited for 3 hours for my first embryo transfer, which was really difficult.  This whole process is so emotionally fraught and my anxiety built with each hour that passed. But the worst part was how it was dealt with - my partner kept checking in with the receptionist, and he continued to assure her that we would be seen in “5 minutes,” which clearly wasn’t happening. When it became clear that she was getting upset he had the Dr on call come out and talk to us. When we complained that we’d been waiting for 3 hours, she replied “yeah, well I’ve been working for more than 3 hours.” It was just an obnoxious comment that was totally unnecessary. After that experience is when we switched to Dr McConell. The staff at her Scarsdale office are all wonderful, pleasant, helpful, and knowledgeable.The doctors are one of their strengths. The medical assistants and blood work assistants are a weakness. The front desk staff is pretty friendly, empathetic and helpful although some more than others. One thing I've realized is they have a lot of patients and a lot of people that have done this before but I have to remind them this is my first time with a fertility treatment plan and to explain things a little more. At the initial consultation a nurse explained all the tests I needed to get and she assigned me to a financial counselor. The financial counselor is great- she gets things sent to my insurance for approval right away which I appreciate.Not suitable for someone who needs treatment that extends beyond their standard protocol e.g. estrogen priming in my case

I have no issues with a clinic that is a cattle call. I understand that a cattle call isn't always a bad thing - it can show that the clinic is organized and efficient in how they see patients. This is not the case with Columbia. The waiting room is extremely uncomfortable and outdated. The chairs are lined up to face a television set that blasts HGTV very loudly every single day. I visited the clinic at all hours of the day and this was also the case. The exam rooms are extremely outdated and felt dirty to me. The walls were covered in marks and desperately needed fresh paint. The sterilizing machines would be left on and beeping non-stop for 10+ minutes at a time until someone would finally come in and turn it off. They do not have many lab techs to take blood work. I would estimate 3 techs at a time. The doctor's do not review your chart or paper before entering your exam room. I had several ask me why I was there today and one incorrectly said, ""you're here for X today, right"" - which was 100% incorrect.The wait time, very often, is excruciating.  4 hours for iui in not unusual. 
You are treated like a number.  Noone will tell you why or how, they just draw your blood, or take you for a sonogram, however they will not explain what they see (on a sonogram screen). 

The billing department will NOT response to your calls.  I paid the balance every time I was there and somehow they still managed to send some bills to ""collection"" even though I never got a bill for it.  A year later there are some amounts disputed: after calling multiple time for an explanation or bills it is still unresolved. 
You cannot just talk to the billing department.  You may only leave a message. The monitoring timeframe was always set very early in the morning, which was convenient given my work schedule. It was a nightmare, and my treatment was unsuccessful. The set protocols made everything easier for the clinic/doctors but weren't successful for me and often left me with negative side effects for several extra days before my procedures. I could barely get a callback, and the clinical staff don't use email. Even though the clinic claimed to have a lot of experience with same-sex couples, they often had to made up the process along the way. Because they didn't have updated consent forms for same-sex couples, we had to pay for a lawyer and advocate for changes to the forms in order to protect of our parental rights. The lead social worker was also highly unprofessional and shared obvious details about the identity of famous patients.Terribly long wait times, difficulty getting in and out for even just a blood draw. Very difficult to get in touch with doctor by phone, even after days of calling and leaving messages. Didn't like seeing a different doctor every time1. You will never see the same doctor twice. Make sure your comfortable with that.
2. You will be told the worst case scenario. It might make you panic. However, I'm glad I was prepared for the worst.
3. The front desk people are the most helpful people around. They know everything and they are really willing to work with your schedule to get you in.Strengths - they are not as expensive, accept more insurances (this wasnt an issue for us but we have heard this from others)

Weaknesses - they are a research institution with zero incentives or motivation to get high success rates with SART. And this will show in every aspect of their operation - from the doctor's knowledge of personal history, to the way billing works to the time it takes for them to return a phone call even for pressing issues (BTW, they dont know the concept of email based communication).It is very efficient and it is clear it works, but it does give off a Factory feeling. You go from one place to another and everything is very routine. If you are new you may feel a bit lost and confused until you figure out how the system works. For example you sign in and walk to billing first and then you have to wait to be paged into the section you are scheduled for. Columbia is a factory and is not well run.  Their excuse is that they take so much insurance but other clinics that take insurance do a much better job from an administrative standpoint (I found out from experience).This clinic does provide good treatment plans and care - that I feel like align well with other clinics I visited. However, it was SO manufactured. Did not feel personal at all and completely lacked any sort of human touch. I did feel confident in the quality of my care overall, but going through an emotional process with very little apparent empathy was tough.The hours and processes at CWRC are ideal to accommodate women who need early appointments before work.  Location is convenient and the scheduling and billing staff is knowledgable and efficient.  One of the unfortunate side effects is that it felt like a factory at times with little concern for the patients as people as opposed to potential statistics. Most doctors we encountered in our almost 2 years as patients at CWRC were lovely and genuine.  On the other side of the coin were doctors like Dr. Guarnaccia, who was cavalier, did not take into consideration our thoughts on treatment and made us feel like he was doing us a favor.  The Center lacked a human touch, but ultimately we would have done virtually anything to conceive. We gave up after emotionally exhausting rounds of fertility drugs, IUIs and IVF and conceived naturally 12 months later. The CWRC would be well served to make the process less stressful for patients by injecting a dose of compassion.The folks at Columbia are friendly and easy to get in touch with. They answered all our questions and were extremely knowledgeable about our care. We had a non-standard insurance issue that we have yet to be able to resolve. It would have been helpful to know up front that they would have a hard time dealing with this. I am not local to Columbia and so I was able to do monitoring in New Jersey at RMA. This was incredibly convenient for me. And I was still able to go in to see Dr. Forman. The clinic is beautiful, everything is very organized and all the staff is very friendly. Always with a smile on their faces. You have everything done right at the clinic and don’t have to be running around finding out where to get things done. The front desk staff, medical assistants and ultra sound techs were super friendly and upbeat. The clinic itself ran on time. Appointments were taken as they were set. I didn't like that my Dr. didn't preform my iui's and it felt like I was just another number by iui #3. By IUI #3 a Dr was no longer doing my follow up ultrasounds and I was assigned to a tech. The great thing about the technicians was that they were more informative than the Dr's.It was great. Never had an issue scheduling an appointment at the time it was convenient for me. Scarsdale vs Manhattan office is different. I appreciate the Scarsdale office and wish they offered ALL of the same services.
The follow up post blood work is lacking as well as the financial approvals with insurance. I had a great experience with this clinic and I also chose to see them given I'm a patient of Columbia University. The staff at the clinic is friendly, responsive, prompt and you are always seeing right on time (helps when scheduling around your appointments).Dr. Stahl's office is part of a large group of medical offices in midtown West. Unfortunately, the waiting room and front desk people handle many different types of doctors and therefore navigating appointments wasn't always pleasant. Busy/crowded waiting rooms, angry people at the front desk, long waits, etc.The clinic has been great so far. I have no other fertility clinic experiences to compare t to, but it far exceeds my experiences with other doctors offices. They are friendly, responsive, and prompt. The client is clean and pretty. The front staff are kind. The medical assistants can be a bit rough and cold sometimes. The other doctors that did monitoring for me were really nice and friendly. It is close the train at Columbia Circle so really easy to get their by public transportation.Easily accessed by subway and the general responsiveness of all staff is pretty good. If you're going for morning monitoring I would recommend earlier timeslots as it starts to get busy after 8am. The doctors rotate doing morning monitoring, and everyone I saw was consistently nice and helpful. Overall, staff at the clinic was friendly and created a welcoming atmosphere. The facility itself is modern and clean. The only problem we had was with the financial coordinator (T), who didn't follow through with what we had agreed on, and stopped answering her phone and emails. At some point we requested a different coordinator, and the issues were resolved.The doctors and their knowledge are this clinic's strengths. Communication is it's weakness.  CWRC is the opposite of the standard IVF mill, so there is more specified patient care.  However, it can result is a haphazardness that effects treatment options.I know they are trying to fix part of the clinic. I was fine with the clinic. The people were friendly the clinic was clean. I wish there was more space but overall it was decent. I like that morning monitoring goes quickly so I can be in and out. This is a very very busy practice and if you need a lot of coddling and warm hugs you may feel a bit disappointed. However, this is a clinic that has very good success rates including difficult cases, advanced maternal age etc.  They do not just treat the easier patients that bring up the ratings. The physicians of the staff are very smart, experienced, knowledgeable, courteous. And mostly they DO care about you. As with everything in life, really making the effort to build positive relationships,  not antagonizing the staff for silly reasons etc. will take you a long way. Strengths are the lower cost versus other clinics, and that they take insurance to cover most aspects of the procedure. They also offer a first time cycle discount which luckily for us made it more affordable. The available statistics for their success is a little bit worse than other clinics in NYC, but its hard to tell if thats because they are less selective about who they will treat. Biggest weakness is the difficulty communicating with the office at times. It's like you're just a number. They're churning people through. If you need your records you need to call and talk to a receptionist and then beg them to help you get in touch with the person who's responsible. It feels very frustrating to use this clinic. I saw several frustrated patients. During my 1st IUI i was told by the nurse to wait on the 4th floor for my husband to finish.  When I got to the 4th floor, a nurse yelled at me and told me I couldn't be down there.  She argued with me when I tried to tell her that the nurse told me to wait there.  She ended up being my nurse for that IUI.  
The waiting room plays HgTv on a loop, its always packed and the bathroom looks dirty and never had soap!The Center For Women's Reproductive Care had convenient hours.  While it was a first come first serve system, you were able to get to the center early in hopes of getting in and out in a timely manner.  The staff was wonderful.  Depending on the day, wait time to get in for your appointment could vary.It is a factory so be prepared to be treated like a number. However, you get a lot of different eyes on your case, which I think is very positive. I also picked every doctor’s brain that I saw. Since you see so many different doctors, I could get a lot of good information. We chose Columbia because they took our insurance. Our previous Dr recommended Dr Choi. The front desk staff was very nice and the location of the office was convenient. The lobby could have used some redecorating but no other issues.The billing was chronically a mess.   The whole situation is sad and frustrating but compared to other clinics, it is cheerful and efficient.   The embryologists are good.   The doctors are kind.   They helped me become a mommyColumbia is great. I feel comfortable there, and I trust the staff. I think you do need to be on your toes and up to date on your progress, as they are busy. I do a lot of following up on my own. Sometimes I get direction on next steps but I have no idea when it starts or how. But so far I haven't had any problems with te clinic itselfThe financial coordinator is incredibly frustrating. I’m consistently chasing her or the insurance company to get the approvals we need - which falls under her responsibility. 

Beyond that - I love it. Beautiful, clean, new offices. Prime location. Staff is great.Columbia is a nice facility I really have no complaints. There strength is how they communicate with their patients. I always got a prompt response when I called and left messages, or sent emails. I also liked that schedule the appointments accordingly, so that I am not waiting an hour in the waiting room for my appointment. All in all it had a good experience at Columbia. 

They run efficiently and there is little wait time. They return calls same day and answer questions. The financial department could be more clear about exact costs and what insurance has already paid for. The strengths are in that it is approachable, smart, and helpful. I really think they are a rare bread in this complicated scene. I feel lucky to have found them. They are extra special and just delightful. Just options if your insurance dors not pay for IVF.  People that desperately want children do not like to hear their insurance will not pay and would love other options. 
More Follow up would have been great.  When I stop coming a phone call to find out how I am doing would have been great. Timely appointments.  And very friendly 
Billing department was a bit hard to get in touch with but I learned they have to deal with insurance companies.   The insurance companies are the ones who need help Monitoring was very early and the window was small. It was important to be there at least 15 min before it began to be seen in a decent window. Getting there for 7am was stressful.It's a large clinic with access to a lot of resources but don't expect to much attention and support. They relied to much on me guessing that I was ovulating from my novice use of OV tests. Ask lots of questions and request that your doc perform all procedures. Also I was billed way more than expected so double check the cost of everything. If you go to the city office you would wait at least 40 mins. Scarsdale office wait was so much better.well oiled machine, for the most partBusy, but efficient and organized.Columbia fertility clinic has cutting edge technology. They have also assembled a good team of doctors and nurses. So overall I am satisfied with the levels of care and treatment and I completely trust the clinicThe clinic is clean, well maintained, modern, and has a calming quality once you enter. Overall the experience thus far has been very smooth and positive. I look forward to continuing my treatment there. Columbia Fertility is a very busy practice, but they did a great job of keeping appointments close to on time, especially monitoring appointments.  They would typically take me within a few minutes, regardless of if I showed up early or later than my timeslot.  The front desk staff is probably the nicest I have ever experienced at an NYC doctor's office.

Appointments with providers with more prone to delays, but even with those, the most I ever waited was 30 minutes on a particularly bad day.  

Location is fairly central for most people in Manhattan.  I lived in Brooklyn, so it was a hike for me, but very accessible to Columbus Circle subway luckily.

Office is very nice, clean, modern.

The biggest drawback for me was seeing a variety of providers that I didn't know for ultrasounds, and one of the venipuncture staff members was not always the best at hitting the target vein which sometimes results in bruising (most were excellent though!).The strengths are many - being able to schedule monitoring appointments to eliminate the wait time is invaluable. The staff is so sweet - they often greet me by name. 

The only weakness is the billing system. As part of a bigger university, the actual billing coordinators are only able to do so much and that needs to change. Everything was quite organized. After each office visit, I received an email in the afternoon about the blood work result, instructions on medication and next appointment. The clinic was clean and the wait time was short which was helpful as I usually had appointments on my way to work.Strengths are how organized they are, front office staff is very friendly.
All doctors I saw were great.  My only weakness would be no one sat down and went over exactly what my cycle schedule would look like and I didnt meet my nurse in person for a while, it was all via email.  I know I could have asked for more information at the start and I would definitely gotten it, but maybe just a bit more face to face time between the specific nurse & care coordinator and patient would be beneficial.  The videos for the injections are very informative but sometimes I think woman need to see the products in person.I am a physician myself and often get frustrated with how doctor's offices run, but this clinic is truly different than most offices.  It is really geared toward patient care and good outcomes.  I never had a bad experience and Columbia's fertility clinic. Columbia Fertility tries to make the process and painless as possible. Their staff is very friendly. Their hours are accommodating for those that work fairly long hours. I always had appointments (besides the initial consultation) in the 7-7:30am range, so could get my bloodwork and ultrasound done before work. The phlebotomist there were first-class. I've never had better experiences getting my blood drawn. Having fertility issues is so tough and Columbia does everything it can to make it easier on us.Appointments were always scheduled before 9am weekdays and weekends.  The waiting room was always absolutely packed but it was run pretty efficiently. I never had to wait too long past my appointment time and was in and out quickly.The clinic is well organized and highly efficient. I was usually in and out within half an hour from my appointment time for morning monitoring. Additionally each patient is provided with a care team in addition to the doctor (nurse, care coordinator, medication management, billing) with emails and numbers to get in contact with each member. The clinic's administrators, including Alyssa, Dr. William's administrator, and the nurses and techs who took blood and organized appointments were excellent and extremely kind. When I found out I was pregnant after a year of treatment and we got past the risky early phases, the front desk staff gave me a huge hug and kisses and we all celebrated together. They are all really excellent. The clinic is very clean, organized, and punctual.  They do a nice job accommodating everyone and keeping everyone aware about what is happening as well as encouraged for positive future outcomes.  Compared to other fertility clinics, Columbia University Center for Infertility has a very welcoming atmosphere and tries to keep everyone up to speed about what each new process entails.I have found the clinic to be organized. They are accommodating to patients on weekends (walk-ins). The front desk staff are welcoming. I am usually in and out of the clinic within half hour or so for blood work and ultrasound. Wait time may be a bit longer for follow up visits with my doctor. The earlier your appointment is the quicker you are seen. I like the consistent flow from one procedure to the next.
I do wish I saw my Primary Physician more often for the ultrasounds rather than any Physician who is present that morning. Columbia seems to have made an effort to cut down on wait time. I never had to wait more than 10 minutes--very important when you're trying to squeeze these appointments in before work. 
All the doctors I saw for ultrasounds seemed very kind and knowledgeable. 
The financial coordinator overall was very helpful, but my one complaint is that I sometimes had to email repeatedly to get the information I needed.Clean, pleasant, and sometimes incredibly crowded in the mornings for monitoring.  The front desk staff are very nice.  The Nordstrom flagship store just opened in the same building, so the surrounding area/getting into the building has gotten a little crazy, but it’s nothing that your average New Yorker can’t handle.The clinic was very pleasant, from the front desk check-in process to back end phlebotomy experience, everyone is always smiling and attentive.  They know you by your name when you are there for every visit.  Also, when doing morning monitoring, you were in and out of the office within 15-20 minutes.  There was never a long wait for morning monitoring, so you will always make it to work on time.The clinic was very efficient in getting patients in and out of the office for appointments and they were very accommodating with your schedule.    Everything from the reception to the patient rooms to blood work area were well organized and very clean. Overall the clinic is very efficient. They work hard to accommodate schedules, work with insurance, and field questions. The staff is wonderful and warm. Don't hesitate to ask questions and advocate for yourself.  Monitoring appointments were scheduled for a specific time, but they were flexible at the same time. So if I needed an earlier appointment, they would easily accommodate that. I would typically get there at 7am, and my wait would be no more than 10-20min.Morning monitoring appointments were super quick, as described at the beginning of this process. I    didn't think they would be as ""in and out"" as described, but they were and I   super appreciated it. Monitoring appointments were busy, but manageable. The way they were set up was not well communicated at first, but after a few clarifications I figured it out (really this shouldn't have been necessary -- the system was simple, the directions, not so much). I think the staff handled things as well as they could. Monitoring is super easy and fast. Monitoring occurs from 7am until 9:30am, 7 days a week. I am particularly grateful for the early hours because it takes at least 45 minutes to get from the clinic to my school (I am a teacher) and I can still make it to work on time if I go in at 7am. Since everyone at the clinic is always so pleasant and friendly, it's not a bad way to start the day. They really make it painless to have to get up a little earlier to go to a monitoring appointment before work. Monitoring is done between 7 and 9, and at the Manhattan location there was often a wait. The Scarsdale location had Mich less wait time. Monitoring started at 7 am. I had to get there by 630AM to be the first few patients in line. I have literally run to the front door of the building to rush to be the first few in line. Consequence of not being the first 1 to 3 is waiting untill 745 am to be seen by the doctor. After seeing the doctor for monitoring, it could take another 20 mins to meet with the nurse. That means spending 1.5 hours for a 3 minute monitoring appointment is my best case scenario. It was pretty efficient. The waiting room is nice and I was seen in a timely manner.Early morning monitoring appointments worked well in this office. It was never a long wait to be seen by the doctor or the lab. There generally was a long wait, but they have now shifted to an appointment based system. There were a lot of people every time. They were not flexible with my work schedule and I could only come at specified hours in the morning.  This was not convenient for my job as a teacher and I had to take off a lot of time. It was as pleasant as it possibly could be.  You weren't there forever.   It was at these monitoring appointments that I discovered that the intrauterine ultrasounds did not have to hurt.   It was very efficient and I barely ever had a wait time.  It was very well managed. Morning monitoring was extremely smooth. I rarely waited more than 10 minutes.  The appointments are in the morning (from 7-9:30AM) so I could fit them in despite having to work a full day. They sometimes made specific appointments, but  you could also walk in between 7 and 9:30 (if I recall correctly).  The mornings were often very busy, a couple of times were standing room only, but I don’t think I ever waited more than twenty minutes for monitoring, especially if I had an appointment.",8.300000000000006,8.399999999999995,"The second IUI I had was done with two male doctors (I don't remember names) and it took them 20 minutes with both of them between my legs trying to do it. Their new billing system is extremely organized and I like how they assign a billing person to each patient for direct communication. The needle pricks are to a minimum and they do a better job than most hospital nurses. The office is bright, clean, and comfortable with complimentary refreshments. Conceptions Florida is a very busy clinic but everyone in the medical team is very attentive and responsive. If insurance wasn't covering my treatment I would be really concerned about the confusion if I was the one paying for all these tests. Again I was there sometimes twice a week. After such outstanding level of care and professionalism I decide to switch all my doctors to Columbia doctors!The clinic is beautiful, newly renovated and clean. There was always someone I could ask to get any question answered. office looks clean and busy, they offer very flexible appointments the atmosphere is very calm and relaxing, in general I was very satisfied  wit the service I got in Columbia University Medical Center. I understand that a cattle call isn't always a bad thing - it can show that the clinic is organized and efficient in how they see patients. They do not have many lab techs to take blood work. The strengths are in that it is approachable, smart, and helpful. Overall the experience thus far has been very smooth and positive."
4,Columbia University,protocol,"I do not have a uterus but still have my ovaries. IVF, creating and freezing embryos and using a gestational carrier was the only strategy. It was all pretty straight forward for everyone. I declined using birth control because I had LH test strips to tell me approximately when my first day of cycle would be. He then monitored my blood work until we knew when to start everything. My injectables were Menopur, Gonal F & Cetrotide.We are at the very beginning of treatment. Since my husband has azoospermia due to blockage, the anticipated treatment would require sperm extraction, egg extraction, ICSI, and finally IVF. Dr. Forman suggested not to perform both the sperm and egg extractions on the same day, in order to prevent me from having to undergo invasive treatment should the sperm extraction not yield the desired results. Dr. Forman also suggested some strategies to save both time and money, which was very much appreciated.estrogen priming & aggressive protocol (450 gonal f with 150 menopur) - it did work for me in that i was diagnosed with diminished ovarian reserve and i had 6 mature eggs.  however, it did not result in a pregnancy.At my first retrieval we used 150 gonal
f and 150 menopur with an hcg trigger which produced only two embryos- one day 6 and one day 7 so we decided to go for a second round of retrieval hoping for a better outcome. The second time we did estrogen priming and 225 gonal f and 150 menopur with a Lupron hcg combination trigger. I had 20 eggs retrieved and 5 embryos were tested pga normal so that was an amazing outcome. Waiting for my FET. We did 2 clomid/IUI cycles before moving on to another doctor. We were ready to try IVF and did not feel comfortable doing it at Columbia or with Dr. Choi. Egg freezing, with adjustments to doses and adding an additional medication before starting, after what she saw in my first cycle.The protocols were not explained to me (wish they had been) and the reasoning for using one drug over another was not explained to me.  One downside of the this clinic and doctor.  I started the stim cycle with 150 Menopur and 200 Follistim then added 250 Ganirelix on the 5th day, with Lupron trigger 2 days before retrieval.  After transfer, I was on 1 ml of progesterone in oil and estradiol 2x daily.   I knew I had a high AMH and produced a large number of eggs.  I ended up with 4 embryos sent for testing and 2 genetically normal embryos.After several tests, we were diagnosed with unexplained infertility, which can be very frustrating. We decided to try IUI first. The first cycle of IUI was with Clomid, which was not successful. The Dr. switched me to Letrozole for the next three IUI cycles. I felt a lot better on Letrozole (much less bloated). Unfortunately, these cycles all resulted in biochemical pregnancies. We met with Dr. Rudick to discuss next steps, and she recommended IVF with genetic testing as she suspected a chromosomal issue in the embryo was the cause of the biochemicals. We proceeded with this recommendation, which produced two normal embryos. We transferred one of the embryos and this resulted in a positive pregnancy. For all 3 IUIs we did letrozole to stimulate follicles. Then I was the one who volunteered to proceed to IVF. For the first egg retrieval, we used menopur and Gonal F. Then we added centrotide and triggered with HCG. For those frozen transfers, we did estradiol to thicken my lining and then progesterone in oil. After 1 miscarriage and 2 failed transfers, we decided to do a second egg retrieval. This was the same protocol. During that retrieval, Dr. Forman did a scratch test to see if there was any inflammation in my uterine lining. There was a few plasma cells found, so I took an antibiotic for that. We also went back and figured out which protocol provided my thickest lining and we decided menopur and Gonal f would gain the best lining for me. This was a natural cycle that I triggered a follicle and used progesterone suppositories instead of the oil. That’s what did the trick!Gonadal F (225 IU), Menopur (225 IU) and Ovidrel were used for egg retrieval. To prepare for the transfer I took estradiol 2mg BID and progesterone IM injections nightly. I continued the estradiol and progesterone injections until the 10th week of pregnancy. Because my husband and I got pregnant naturally two times and it ended in molar pregnancies we decided to seek dr. Williams as he is a master in early pregnancy loss. He diagnosed me with endometriosis and pcos. As a result he began by monitoring my cycles and started a medications routine. We first tried IUI with Clomid and Ovidrel. The second IUI we used Letrozole (and Ovidrel for trigger). Both were negative preg tests. Given my age (38) and my partners sperm quality (not horrendous, but not great), we then moved on to IVF. 
For the stimulation, we did Follistim (150/night) and Menopur (75/night) for 7 days (Follistim was upped to 200/night for the last three days). For the 6th and 7th days, I also took Ganirelix. On day 8, I did my trigger shot, and retrieval was morning of day 10. I think part of the rationale for the doses was my good ovarian reserve/AMH levels.
8 eggs were retrieved; 4 were mature; 2 were fertilized; and 1 made it to day 5 (blastocyst, good morphology). We did PGT for that one and it was normal. (Now just waiting for treatments to begin again before transferring.)Unfortunately, we had to start with IUI procedures before insurance would pay for IVF coverage. Dr. Rudick explained that this was standard, but I  wish that we could have skipped over some of these cycles because it was a waste of time and money. I   often wondered if Dr. Rudick could possibly do anything or advocate on our behalf to reduce the amount of times we had to endure IUI cycles. After they were finished, we moved onto IVF and while the first round was unsuccessful, we are hopeful that round #2 will work, once Columbia Fertility has clearance to re-open. She used ICSI and embryos were frozen as I suffered from hyper stimulation during the retrieval phase. Hence, transfer was done after one and a half month. Besides, she followed a very regular monitoring regime throughout the process.Dr. McConnell suggested we start with IUI -- initially she suggested three, but we ended up moving on to IVF after the second was unsuccessful because Dr. McConnell noticed an issue with the sperm and she didn't think the 3rd IUI would be worth it. When we moved on to IVF she suggested PGS testing due to me being AMA. This was definitely worth it, as 5 of our 11 blastocyst stage embryos came back with issues that would not have made them viable. We did one transfer and, when that failed, she suggested we do an ERA to make sure that I was responding well to the medicine. Once that was confirmed, we moved on to our second transfer, which was successful. Although I wsa sometimes frustrated with how long everything took, I believe in hindsight that Dr. McConnell made the best medical choices for us.  I don't remember any of the treatment strategies but I just remember that that first cycle of IVF went really fast. My body seemed to have taken immediately to the medication; however after retrieving 7 eggs, only 2 embryos were good. I know she had the intention of switching things up for the second round of IVF but she left before we could start it. I can't remember everything but I do remember that Dr. K. decided to change my treatment and drugs from what my previous doctor had done, so that my eggs would grow at an equal rate and there wouldn't be a variety of mature and not mature eggs during the retrieval. After that cycle of IVF rendered no good embryos, she changed things up again. Then we got 1 good embryo from that. Dr. K performed the embryo transfer and we are currently in our 5th month of pregnancy. Work up bloodwork to check AMH,FSH levels and AFC since there was concern for DOR.

Banking before transferring 
When taking over my treatment from another Columbia doctor, Dr. Karipcin took the time to get to know me and my fertility past. She din't just rush in (even though I was impatient). Before doing another transfer, she decided to test my uterine lining a step that felt like it was delaying us further and felt unnecessary. They discovered that I had endometritis which can take months to treat. I was very frustrated and discouraged after this diagnosis. Following diagnosis I went through 4 rounds of antibiotics and uterine biopsies to try and get the inflammation of my uterus to go away. The process was long and daunting. When I finally tested negative for endometritis we got the green light from her that we could move forward with our 3rd embryo transfer. the day before our transfer Dr. Karipcin was nearly giddy telling us that she had chosen the best embryo for tomorrows transfer and she seemed as excited as we were! During the transfer my retroverted uterus was hard to see/ find on the monitor, so rather than guiding the catheter with the visual help of the ultrasound, she did unaided transfers off of feel and her past training at Cornell! We are now 8 weeks pregnant and going strong!Dr. Williams stopped an IVF cycle Day 8 into meds as he felt I could get better results with a different attempt, so we switched to IUI that month. When we were ready for another IVF round, I was put on Chlomid, Menapur and Follistim. I never really had a reaction to meds, but this go around with the addition of the Chlomid I was super tired - exhausted. I never felt hormonally out of control, just tired and sleepy after the Chlomid so I started taking it right before bed instead of the morning.With my first round of IUI, the Clomid caused ovarian cysts that took a while to go away. After that she switched me to Letrozole and I had no problem with it. When I began IVF, she monitored my follicles closely and raised the dose of Gonal-f and Menopur as she felt necessary. Considering my low reserve, I had a good egg yield during that cycle so she kept my doses the same during the next one. After my first round of IVF, I waited to do a frozen transfer and it didn't take so after the second round, we did a fresh transfer. All along Dr. Brady has been recommending that we do genetic testing of the embryos but we declined because of cost. In my first pregnancy, we had heard a heartbeat at 7 weeks and everything was proceeding normally. Then, when I went in for my last appointment with the clinic, Dr. Brady discovered at that time that the baby's heart had stopped beating. In disbelief, I asked the next day if she could check again and she invited me in and even had another doctor take a look. She recommended a D&C and testing of the contents of conception. The results of the testing showed that the baby had trisomy 9. I was grateful to know this as it helped bring closure to the loss. After that, Dr. Brady proceeded with additional testing (including additional blood panels and an endometrial biopsy) to make sure we cover all our bases before doing another transfer. I just lost my second pregnancy very suddenly at 6 weeks and when I informed Dr. Brady, she asked me to bring in the tissue I had passed so she could send it off for testing. She wants to schedule a meeting with my husband and I next week to discuss additional genetic testing and how we can try to prevent additional miscarriages. I've just recently started seeing Dr. Forman however I already feel comfortable with him. After multiple failed transfers he was the only person who offered me an option. Instead of pushing me to proceed with another transfer that could potentially fail and result in losing my last embryo he suggested an new test to measure my receptivity to the transfers and it turns out that I needed more time on progesterone than my previous doctor was aware of. All of my transfers were being done too soon.I have unexplained infertility. The only hiccup in my bloodwork was borderline hypothyroid, so we started on Synthroid right away. For my first cycle we did clomid and an IUI. My uterine lining was thin as a side effect of the clomid so for the second cycle we switched to letrozole. After we decided to try IVF we did an SHG test. I had done an HSG 6 months prior, but he wanted to make sure everything looked normal before starting IVF  Everybody is different and after several IUIs and continuously monitoring my ovulation we learnt some things about my body which helped us to address when we arrived to the final step IVF.  I completed one IUI cycle  with Dr. Forman. I used Clomid followed by an Ovidrel injection prior to insemination. During this process I was frequently monitored by ultrasound to assess my eggs and blood hormone levels. This continued after a positive pregnancy result to monitor the embryo until I was discharged from his care. I'm in the beginning stages for egg freezing. Dr. Rudick and I discussed medications in general terms as well as PCOS and my past blood results, and I would like to have heard more specifics, but this is something that I will follow up on. She was thorough and thoughtful in explaining the procedure and rationale.The first three cycles I did a basic IUI protocol with Clomid and a trigger shot. Dr McConnell has diagnosed me with low ovarian reserve, a blocked Fallopian tube and some male factor infertility in my partner but she wanted to start with a least invasive procedure and work up. I appreciated this because it also eased me into the treatments and shots as the IVF cycles we did later were much more involved. When we did our first IVF I was on Gonal-F, Menopur and later Cetrotide to prevent premature ovulation al followed with a Gonadotropin trigger shot. We did subcutaneous injections for everything - except the trigger shot. This first retrieval yielded 3 eggs but none made it to blastocyst stage. The second retrieval cycle we did a similar protocol but she upped the Gonal-F dosage to 450 from 300 units. That time we got one embryo and did a transfer supported by Oral Estrogen and Progesterone shots. The transfer was unsuccessful. We went back in for a consultation and decided to adjust some things for the third round including doing all shots intramuscularly - which Dr McConnell said could possibly increase absorption rates. In addition to the Gonal-F and Menopur, the third time she added Lupron shots. This time we retrieved 5 eggs and 3 made it to blastocyst but after PGS testing unfortunately none were genetically normal so there weren’t any to transfer. If we had done a transfer however, Dr McConnell had gotten me going on a mock transfer cycle to test my uterine lining with an ERA procedure to give us more information about the quality of the lining so that we could adjust the dosage of Progesterone or estrogen as needed to get the lining ideal for implantation.   From what I can remember, I did a few tests at the beginning of my visits to ensure I was in the right track, such as checking my hormone levels, a brain MRI, blood work, genetic tests, etc. After these initial tests, I was prescribed to take a small amount of Cabergoline once a week to balance my prolactin levels. My blood work and uterus were screened frequently in order to see my progress. During my first IUI try, I took Clomid, and for the last two IUIs, I took Letrozole which I was able to get pregnant with. On the 3rd IUI, I was able to get pregnant with twins :)We started out with a medium dose of Clomid, ater having tried Letrozole with my general Ob-Gyn before with no reaction at all. The response with Clomid was slow but there was a reaction and had my ovulation induced with Ovidrell and an IUI performed two days later. I am still waiting to know the results. With my previous IVF cycle, I did not get any embryos due to poor egg quality. During our first IVF cycle, Dr Forman reduced the dose of Menopur for the first few days to help curb my estrogen levels since my eggs were maturing too early leading to poor egg quality. The cycle lasted a few more days but he wanted to ensure that the follicles were a good size and did not mature too early before retrieval. I was able to get 1 day 6 embryo from this cycle. 
With my 2nd IVF cycle, Dr Forman tried the long Lupron protocol to help improve egg quality. I was doing a micro dose of Lupron for about 2-3 weeks before starting actual IVF medication. This cycle gave us 2 embryos. 
We then did the ERA test since we had 2 failed transfer cycles with our very first IVF treatment at another clinic. Dr Forman wanted to make sure that we were transfering the embryo at the right time since some women have shifted windows of implantation. The test came back at the right window for previous transfers. Dr Forman then decided to do a natural cycle transfer for us to try something new and see if it works better with my body this time. We elected not to move to IVF treatment just yet. My fiance has male factor infertility that could potentially be solved through surgery. As I am young and in good fertile health, we elected to wait to pursue IVF until after the surgery is complete and hopefully the sperm quality is much higher quality. I am still in process but given our later age dual miscarriages and the fact that we are able to get pregnant IVF with genetic testing. (PGS) was recommended. Hatching service will be done as well. We also did the genetic testing prior to starting IVF cycle 

We learned that my husband has one gene for a disorder that could be passed to embryo however because I did not carry this we are not at risk. She was frank about the fact that he did not require testing if we wanted to save money but that it might delay our schedule 3-6 weeks. With this knowledge we were able to move ahead. She was frank that she did not know the cost of this test if paying or of pocket. We ended up with a whopping bill bit we should have followed up with the financial folks PRIOR to leaving office to learn details and if we wanted to proceed. 

We will freeze embryos that are not implanted for future use. She was nonjudgmental about our decisions on what to do with embryo we do or do not use which is key since it’s a very sensitive matter. 
We did a supplemented natural frozen embryo transfer. Lining thickened on its own (without estrogen pills), triggered ovulation with Ovidrel and took progesterone suppositories 3x a day after that. After our first cycle, we were a bit disappointed for getting only 2 healthy embryos. I didn’t understand why as I was in my mid 30s and started with 27 eggs (a really good number I thought). Also, the temptation to just get on with it and try to do a transfer was there. Dr. Brady pushes us to 1) so another cycle to get more embryos. 2) put me on birth control to better sync up my eggs. We got a much better result the second time- 5 healthy frozen embryos. Now we are pregnant but also will likely not have to go through the shots again to complete our family! Two failed IUI cycles: one with Clomid, and another on Letrozole when Clomid resulted in a thin lining. Responded well to both. One IVF cycle: Menopur and Gonal F with Cetrotide. I had a lower response than I had hoped with just 7 eggs, 5 of which made it to blast, and 2 of which ended up being normal.I did one IUI cycle with a double IUI (two IUIs performed 24 hours apart) with Letrozole and Progesterone suppositories. This was after having done 2 unsuccessful IUI cycles with Clomid. Dr. Forman said that he used Letrozole because it tends to work better with patients with endometriosis. I have not technically been diagnosed with endometriosis but its suspected because of a 3cm cyst on my right ovary that appears to be an endometrioma.My husband and I both went for fertility testing including blood tests, semen analysis and an HSG. We were diagnosed with male infertility but it was determined that IUI could still be successful. We had 2 rounds of IUI that resulted in 2 negative pregnancy tests. Following this we had 1 round of IVF with 3 day transfer which resulted in our baby girl. Dr Forman also referred my husband to a urologist who specializes in male fertility.Two rounds antibiotics, vitamin D, aspirinWe came to Dr. Williams after a number of miscarriages. He started off by reviewing all the repots from our previous Doctors. He took multiple blood tests and monitored the sugar levels. Then he did a Sanagram to try to identify the cause. The cause he identified was a combination of blood clotting that were around the embryo and high sugar levels that didn't allow the placenta to connect properly to the embryo. I was put on a low carb and sugar diet and baby aspirin. I was monitored until he confirmed that it was a safe and successful pregnancy.I believe we began with testing for various auto-immune and sensitivity disorders as well as genetic testing on past embryos and my husband and I.  Then a hysteroscoopy revealed scar tissue and lesions inside the uterus.  Two further adhesolysis procedures followed with baloon insert and rounds of estrogen following to regrow uterine lining.One Round of Antibiotics - due to Chronic Endometritis (low grade uterine infection which can inhibit fertility and/or cause miscarriage)
Operative Hysteroscopy for Asherman's Syndrome - to remove moderate scarring which was found on my cervix and inside my uterine cavity
Vitamin D supplementation
Folic Acid supplementation
Baby Aspirin + Lovenox Injection - due to an ACE Gene Mutation
Metformin - due to insulin resistance
Prometrium (vaginally) - due to low levels of progesterone in the early weeks of my pregnancy
My husband's first sperm analysis came back with results that he had extremely low sperm count.  Columbia referred us to a urologist they recommended, who ended up being completely disorganized and disappointing.  Since he has such low sperm count we should've pursued a competent urologist path in the first place, but Dr. Grossman said we'd be ok doing IVF as long as we had a few sperm to work with.  I went through the egg retrieval process (which was an nightmare.  they overstimulated me and doubled the dose of hormones).  I could barely walk the two days preceding my egg retrieval process and they got 33 eggs from me (way above normal).  We had to wait a month for first transfer because my ovaries were overstimulated and had to calm down.  The first transfer was done by a random doctor, and failed.  Our second transfer was done by another random doctor (who used a completely different procedure) and failed.  I haven’t gotten a chance to have a cycle with her yet. She ordered an SHG test which discovered I had Fibroids so I had to undergo two surgeries to remove them. I’m currently recovering now from the 2nd one. This time around, by evaluating my previous procedures, Dr. Forman saw that I could take higher dosage but almost the same medication. The only different medication I've received from Dr. Forman is the the pregesterone. Instead of the normal pills, I was given pregesterone in sesame oil. I was also seeing Dr. Forman almost every week during the process and made sure that my bloodwork is all good. I was basically monitored closely which I think helped in the whole process to see how my body is reacting to the treatment. I did 2 IVF cycles with Dr McConnell. Both times I used injectables (Gonal F and Cetrotide) to prepare for the egg retrieval. For the first cycle I did a fresh embryo transfer using 2 5-day blastocysts. When this cycle was unsuccessful, Dr McConnell had a follow up appointment with my partner and I to recommend PGS testing for the next cycle. We had 4 embryos tested and 2 were deemed chromosomally normal. I transferred one which resulted in my current pregnancy, and the other is still frozen for a future transfer. After trying for a little over a year we decided to seek answers. Due to female cycle irregularity and male low morphology Dr. Douglas suggested clomid with better timed intercourse at home or we could go straight to IUI. Due to the low morphology and the fact that we do have insurance coverage for IUI we decided to do that. I started with 50mg of clomid on cycle days 3-7 with an IUI the day following LH surge.Results of my STIM cycles were very poor - I had very few follicles to work with. I requested adjustments to my treatment protocol to improve my chances e.g. estrogen priming but was told a flat no because I don't ovulate regularly and wouldn't fit into one of their standard protocols (I actually went on to have success with priming at another clinic). On another occasion, I was stimmed with a dominant follicle which ultimately resulted in a cancelled cycle. In summary, I was encouraged to keep repeating the same standard protocol even though the monitoring sessions revealed low follicle count and in some cases a clear dominant follicle. My husband had low morphology (1%). That was our only known issue. Dr. McConnell did not believe morphology would impact our success and she strongly suggested we try natural IUI (no drugs at all). We did 2 failed natural IUI cycles before I grew frustrated and called the nurse asking to be allowed to do an IUI w/ clomid cycle. The nurse said OK. I never heard back from Dr. McConnell so I don't even know what her rationale was for saying OK.Treatment strategies: 50mm clomid, iui, check for pregnancy. 
result: negativefailed medicated FETs with the same standard protocol each cycle (estrace, antagonist, progesterone suppositories, low dose medrol before transfer)Advised Clomid after a miscarriage even though I had no documented fertility problems and had gotten pregnant on my second natural cycle of IUI because he said that at my age (39) it would improve my chances.I was lucky. I only had to go through one cycle of IUI. She said I had unexplained infertility and there was no particular reason I wasn't getting pregnant. She said because of that it would just be best to stimulate more egg production with clomid. I started clomid on cycle day 3, I went in for daily ultrasounds to check on the egg development. I had 2 good ones developing. At mid cycle I was told to check an ovulation stick daily and once I saw the surge to come in the next morning for my IUI. If it didn't happen by Thursday, I was to use an injection to stimulate ovulation. Luckily, the surge hit Wednesday night and I did not need to inject. (I really hated that because they don't work on weekends, I would have had to buy an expensive drug and inject it). I went in with my husband for my IUI, after they told me to lay down for 5 minutes. I had read that laying down for 15 minutes produced better results... so I stuck around for 15 anyway.Did 6 IUI cycles with Dr. Rackow and was on clomid (though they switched to a different one for a few cycles because of vision side effects). 

Always got only one mature follicle - never more than one - but she made no changes to the plan. He first did a blood test and discovered I had Beta Thalasemia trait. That helped me to pick a sperm donor that did not have that. I also had to do an HSG to make sure the Fallopian tubes were clear. I also had blood tests and ultrasounds to track and time ovulation. Finally I did the iui. After I became pregnant, he continued to monitor my hcg with bloodwork and had an ultrasound at 6 weeks before he released me.The treatment plan was 6 clomid IUIs before looking to change the protocol because that they said was standard practice. I was not treated as an individual I was treated as someone who was infertile the same way it appears others were being treated. I don't remember this information well enough.I had four cycles of IUI.  She originally recommended that we only do 3 before IVF.  I took 100mg of Clomid for days 2-6, with regular monitoring and then insemination after either a positive OPK or ovidrel shot.  The first cycle was a biochemical pregnancy.  Second cycle was negative.  Third cycle resulted in a pregnancy that was ultimately not viable (no fetal heartbeat), followed by a D&C (performed by a different doctor).  Fourth cycle resulted in my son.  We met with her after the miscarriage and she recommended that we continue with IUI because they were clearly working in getting me pregnant, we just needed a viable pregnancy.  She also ordered recurrent pregnancy loss blood tests at that time, all came back normal.As someone with unexplained infertility, Dr. Lobo recommended 3 IUI's before moving on to IVF, but suggested that success rate with IUI would be relatively low. Since I responded well to medicated cycles, we went that route instead of injectibles. I ultimately ended up doing 4 IUI's - 2 with Clomid, 1 with Femara, and one natural because I ended up with a cyst from the Clomid. None were successful. It was routine.  Fertility drugs, IUI then IVF. Not personalized but rather their standard protocol. Dr. Forman developed a protocol in consultation with us and using data we'd received from an unsuccessful treatment previously with another doctor. Unfortunately, we don't remember the specifics at this time.I am still in treatment with DR. Rudick. So far we have covered the initial consultation, had all my labs done along with my husbands she tested us for Zoila since we traveled to the Caribbean also genetic testing along with a semen analysis for my husband and complete blood test for myself also an HSG and SHG. Currently waiting for some results to arrive in order to move on to the next step. First round of IUI I was given clomid and ovedril. Second and third IUI's was given letrozole and ovedril, as the clomid had thinned my uterus.Multiple medicated IUI, first with different doses of clomid and ovidril, then an adjustment to letrozolye after side affects. Treatment for uterine polyps and a DNC. Egg extraction with PGS testing on the final embryos prior to freezing. We also went with a natural cycle for the transfer as she wanted to help lessen the strain on my thyroid. I have just just finished my first IUI cycle.  I started Clomid for 5 days (medium dose) on the 3rd day of my cycle.  I would have weekly ultrasounds/ bloodwork to confirm my follicles were growing properly and not too many.  Then once 1-2 were large enough, I gave myself the Ovidrell shit at home.  Then in 2 days I was in office for the insemination.  Then a week after bloodwork for progesterone levels and then the following week for pregnancy test.Dr. Stahl completed a number of medical tests to determine the extent of my male factor infertility. Once all of these test were complete, he took a look at the results holistically and was able to offer a surgical option to potentially remedy all of my issues. The surgery was just completed, successfully, and am now in the waiting period to see if it increased my sperm quality. She diagnosed me with PCOS and the analyzed my husband to ensure there were no male factors. There weren’t so we are proceeding with treating my PCOS. She started me on a low dose of letrezole to get me to ovulate and the first cycle went as planned but did not result in a pregnancy. We are now trying again. She first sent us to do s lot of testing to rule out any other diagnoses. She recommended we try letrozole over clomid because I have pcos. I had 5 IUIs - one unmedicated and four medicated. The first IUI was unmedicated only because we were out of town during the monitoring period. The next three IUIs were recommended as they are much less intrusive than IVF and can have positive outcomes in couples diagnosed with unexplained infertility. The last IUI was required by my insurance company prior to approval for IVF, and happily we became pregnant. We had 3 IUI cycles (1 single, 2 double) that were unsuccessful. IVF worked on the first try. We had a single frozen embryo transfer after ICSI and PGS.For both cycles, Dr. Williams used oral medication instead of injectable medication because my body did not respond particularly well to the injectables, and there were other indicators that oral medications may be more successful.  The first cycle resulted in three eggs in one embryo that arrested.  The second cycle was not completed due to poor results.Due to my specific issues we have had to undergo, IVF early on instead of IUI, she has also required ICSI because there are concerns about the sperm. During my IVF cycle my progesterone spiked early and instead of risking losing the embryos she changed my IVF cycle from a fresh cycle to a freeze all. Her rational was that my body could potentially be out of sync and if we attempted to put one of my two embryos in we run a high risk of it not taking. So we froze all my embryos. I have under went one FET that did not work out and I will be undergoing a second FET soon. I was a patient for a few years (unexplained infertility) and we did many different cycles - from IUI Ss to IVFs with ICSI. I don't remember all the details. What I can say is that Dr. Choi is  always careful to tweak the protocols to personalize treatments. Our case didn't really involve too much starter. She was mainly doing fertility testing. I changed doctors before the IUI cycle.IUI with Clomid 50mg and a trigger shot (Ovidrel 250mg).  That was done twice and after the 2nd unsuccessful IUI i never heard a word from Columbia. No one told me how bad I would feel during and after taking Clomid.  I thought I was losing my mind.Our infertility was unexplained at the time.  I was placed on Clomid and we did Clomid and IUI.  We conceived on our 3rd IUI cycle (4 IUI in total).Antagonist ivf protocol with 5 day blast FET with PGS testing.Dr Choi recommended starting off with IVF w/ PGS due to recurrent miscarriages. We had done 3 IUIs with another clinic and she was sure that we needed to move on to IVF. I can't remember the exact protocols, but know that she adjusted the meds for all three IVF cycles based on my reactions. She also referred us to a reproductive immunologist after the 2nd IVFw/PGS failed, on a hunch that there may be something there. She was right and our third IVFw/PGS was a success.Lupron - Stim - HCG shot - Retrieval.    That is all I remember...  my children are 10 now so this was 11 or 12 years ago.  We performed a standard IUI - Clomid from day 3 of my cycle, then Ovidrel, then IUI 36 hours later10 days of injections followed by the trigger. (Menopur and goneril and one other). Then we did a retrieval. Eggs fertilized but didn’t mature enough to be implanted. Follistim which produced 19 eggs, and only 2 good embryos. Letrozole for annovulation with IUI to increase chances. Menopur next for low LH with IUI.We did a natural cycle and then a trigger shot and two rounds of IUI's. Now we are doing letrozole, trigger and IUI. Many important invasive testing.  We started with IUI.  Had miscarriage in my second one.  Then we tried again for 8 more tries. Then we went to IVF.  Second IVF worked fresh transfer at first, and then a frozen transfer. regular protocol with meds. Only after my miscarriage was it suggested to genetically test the embryos.  4 IUI's the last 2 included ClomidIui unmedicated She offered to go right to IVF but for our unexplained infertility we opted to try IUI firstUnfortunately, I can't remember those kinds of specifics anymore!I have not started the treatment She suggests me to undergo IVF treatment due to my partners sperm quality and my diminishing eggs due to my age and recurrent miscarriages. I underwent two treatment cycles with Dr. Rudick.
Cycle 1: 5 days of Clomid starting on CD3, 50mg (lowest dose).  Monitoring via vaginal ultrasound starting around CD10 to monitor follicle growth.  Trigger shot injection given to myself at home once one follicle was large enough (largest that cycle was 18mm).  Provided with directions for timed intercourse after trigger shot.  This cycle did not result in pregnancy.

Cycle 2: 5 days of Clomid starting on CD3, 50mg (lowest dose).  Monitoring via vaginal ultrasound starting around CD10 to monitor follicle growth.  Follicles failed to grow by CD14, so I had several additional monitoring ultrasounds through CD17 when the follicle finally grew to 21mm on right side.    Trigger shot injection given to myself at home once one follicle was large enough.  Provided with directions for timed intercourse after trigger shot.  This cycle resulted in pregnancy.We started with oral meds and IUIs. My IUI first cycle we tried Letrozole but I didn't respond well so we went back to Clomid and did a double IUI. When that didnt work, I took a cycle off from monitoring but took Clomid to ensure I ovulated and keep things moving forward. Dr. Forman had mentioned injectable meds as a course of treatment but I was resistant and concerned about multiples. After reading a blog of a patient successfully pregnant via injectables, I decided to follow his advice and move ahead with them for the next cycle. And it worked - we were pregnant! I was NOT expecting it and was fully prepared to move on to IVF. Unfortunately, we had a miscarriage - and we were prepared for it as Dr. Forman saw the signs during an early scan. He never gave us false hope but was very pragmatic in managing expectations. We're now onto IVF and retrieval cycles - our first one did not yield as many as expected, but we're learning from it and hoping to have more success this 2nd time around. After five cycles of IUI resulted negative, Dr. Brady advised us to move to IVF which gave us a positive result on the first trial.We did gonal, menapur and cetratide injections.  We did PGS testing.  Both of my retrievals yielded a very similar results based on my dosage.  I am relatively young (34 years old) with no major issues aside from a bit of PCOS, so we started off with a few cycles of timed intercourse- mostly with letrezole, but tried clomid once.  We did 5 cycles of this and then were supposed to move on to IUI, however due to work reasons, we decided to wait unitl Jan 2020 when my new insurance would cover IVF.  We had one cycle of stims with gonalF and menopur and triggered with ovidrel for our retrieval.  We did then decided to wait for the next cycle to do a frozen transfer so we could do PGS and also provide for optimal lining.  For our FET next month, I was started on estradiol, then began progesterone in oil 6 days prior to my transfer, which worked!! I'm now 9 weeks pregnant with a little girl!Dr. Brady first started me with Metformin to let my body adjust to it. She wanted to see if that was enough to get my ovulation started regularly. She told me we would try that for a few months and if that didn't work on it's own, we would try a round of timed intercourse - which would involve Letrozole and a trigger shot. She told me that timed intercourse usually works within the first 4 tries and after 6, we would talk about other methods (i.e., IUI, IVF, etc.) I was very, very lucky that the timed intercourse worked for me on my 4th try.Our case was not that involved. I have Pcos and responded well to clomid but did not conceive after 4 cycles of clomid/ovadril.  My previous doctor was ready to move on to IVF as she felt that iui would be ineffective for us and that it was too dangerous to try as I responded with a large number of follicles to stimulation. Coming to Dr. Brady, I was fearfully expecting that ivf would be our only option. Dr. Brady not only dispelled that myth, but provided me with an alternate treatment approach. She recommended letrazol/ovadril as research has come out that it is more effective for PCOS patients. Furthermore she projected a plan to try at least 8-12 cycles with oral medication, possibly adding iui at some point before jumping to IVF as we had only tried 4 cycles of medication and it can take people even without any fertility complications more than four cycles of trying to conceive. We are happy to report that are first letrazol/ovadril cycle was successful. See comments above.Dr. Brady adjusted the meds I had been taking during my egg retrieval based on how effective they were.  I ended up having a retrieval after about a week on the injections which I was thankful for because it was nice to stop those sooner than later (even though I understand how they act differently on different people).  Dr. Brady has ensured that our healthy embryos have successfully frozen so she is now trying to navigate when the best time would be for the embryo transfer so that my body and the embryo are in the best conditions for a smooth transfer.My treatment included IUI protocol with blood work and ultrasound on day 2-4
Followed by a phone call that day to start taking Clomid 50mg for 5days (2 pills).
Ultrasound and blood work to check hormone levels and follicles for size at approximately day 8-10. May have another ultrasound 3 or so days later to reassess follicle size and uterus lining thickness. This is followed by a trigger shot of ovidril the morning of the day prior to IUI date. The IUI was cancelled because I was going to travel to a Zika territory.
I am now following the same protocol for pending IUI but instead of Clomid, I am taking Letrozole 2.5mg.


We saw Dr. Forman for IVF with PGD after learning I carried an x-linked disease. He was willing to do a repeat genetic panel to confirm the diagnosis. 

We eventually did three rounds of stimulation drugs:
Round 1 - 150 Follistim and 150 Menopur, then Ganirelix, then 10000 HcG. 
Yield: 14 eggs, 7 mature, 6 fertilized, 2 made it to blastocyst. 
Round 2 - 300 Follistim and 150 Menopur, then Ganirelix, then 5000 HcG and Lupron (dual trigger)
Yield: 15 eggs, 7 mature, 7 fertilized, 6 made it blastocyst.
Round 3 - Estradiol to suppress before starting (because I'd had a leading follicle in between rounds that led us to delay). Same medication regimen as Round 2.
Yield: 25 eggs, 15 mature, 13 fertilized, 7 made it to blastocyst. 

The thinking was that increasing the stim dosage would improve possibly both my egg yield and the number of embryos that made it to day 5. The thinking behind the Lupron was that it might help my egg maturity ratio. Neither was a perfect fix, but the results kept improving overall, so we were pleased. We had to do three rounds because few embryos passed both the PGS and PGD testing, and we wanted to do a transfer with a couple embryos banked.

Before the FET, we did progesterone shots and estrogen pills, and the first one took!I did four unsuccessful IUI cycles.  We wanted to start with the least invasive procedures first, especially since I was working a very high stress job which I didn’t want to combine with IVF.  The first two were with Clomid, which I HATED.  The second IUI never even came to fruition, as the Clomid gave me a cyst that prevented doing the actual IUI.  We did the next two with no drugs, despite the fact that she warned us of a very low (1 - 2%) success rate.  This was our choice & she was supportive of it.
After my job ended, we did two rounds of IVF stimulation for frozen transfers.  The first one egg retrieval was a disaster - no one’s fault, but I suffered internal bleeding and ended up in the hospital for three days and needing a blood transfusion.  Internal bleeding is an uncommon side effect, but known risk of egg retrieval listed on the paperwork that you sign before your surgery.  Dr Rudick and the other staff at Columbia were extremely helpful and caring at this time - talking on the phone to my husband and my doctors at the hospital I ended up with to explain and follow up for three days.  They were constantly checking in with me to see how I was doing.  
After all of that, we only ended up getting one PGS tested normal embryo.  Dr Rudick suggested possibly doing another cycle to get more embryos (especially since we hope for another child in the future), as well as specific uterine lining tests if we wanted to move forward with the single good embryo.
We did another round of stimulation, which a slightly different medicine protocol.  This one was a breeze & yielded four PGS normal embryos, two of which were seven-day embryos.     
Dr Rudick was very flexible with timing and encouraged me to do the transfer once another work project had been completed so that I could take it easy surrounding the transfer.  (My work is very intense with long hours & plenty of stress).  
It worked & I am currently 8 weeks pregnant!  I’m on a progesterone suppository until 10 weeks to further support the pregnancy.  We’ve been in for sonograms every weeks for the past three weeks, and are now moving on to a regular midwife practice.Preparation for egg retrieval: Gonol F 225U daily for 10-12 days, Menopur 75U daily for 10-12 days, Cetrotide for 5 days; HCG trigger injection x 1. To produce follicles for retrieval.
ICSI with the retrieved follicles and allow 5-6 day fertilization and freeze embryos.
Frozen embryos have greater success rates of conceiving than fresh embryo transfers with timing.Monitored me very closely to ensure proper course of actions with injections and medication. Letrozole, IUIHe urged us to transfer twoDr. Forman suggested implanting a single embryo only, as he was confident that given my values this should not be a problem. He said that if we were to perform genetic testing on the embryo pre-implantation, this would allow us to determine whether any of the generated embryos might not be good for implantation, thus raising the chances to obtain a successful pregnancy after implanting just one embryo.Given my age, Dr. Paula Brady decided to go for a single embryo transfer as it is safer. We transferred all embryos that looked good--more than typical--because of my age. We transferred five 3-day which resulted in my son. Dr. McConnell followed our desires regarding transfers.  Both times we transferred two embryos.  The first ones did not take.  The second time, a frozen transfer, produced a pregnancy that gave us our son.I trusted Dr. Forman's suggestion on transferring a single embryo for my first IVF cycle and it was successful.  The doctor transferred single embryo as she advised it to be safe for us and we had no issue with that.I had 9 eggs retrieved 7 survived by day 5 only one healthy embryo was viable I think it’s smart of Dr. Forman to use eSET. He explained the risks of multiples and it’s a no brainer - why risk it. N/A She worked with us to decide how many embryos to transfer. We all agreed on 2 each cycle.The doctor transferred two embryos in, to give me the best chance at having one successful pregnancy. Dr. Rudick will do a multiple embryo transfer only if you acknowledge you understand the risks. She has a strong preference for single transfers. Dr. Rudick recommended transferring one embryo at a time, to avoid a multiple pregnancy. We agreed on this course of action.I always wanted to have one child at a time and Dr. Forman is a big advocate for it, so it was perfect for us.Dr. Forman's recommendation was for eSET, in part because we did PGT. We agreed with that approach.She was not a proponent of multiple embryo transfers and we were not that interested in that anyway. We asked questions about it and considered it but we were told that with advances these days, you only do multiples if you want to have multiples. It wasn't like before when doctors encouraged multiple embryos to ensure having one good birth. I believe her approach was to lean towards single embryo vs. multiple embryo, which was what we wanted too. She was very up front when we asked her about our chances of conceiving after the transfer was done. She offered to do an exam that would test my uterus to see if there was anything that might impede the transfer from being successful. We ended up not going with it. We just did the transfer and it worked. Dr Brady strongly believes in single embryo transfer and made that clear in our initial IVF consultation Dr. Karipcin said that due to my age, general health and past transfer success (none thus far) she wanted to continue to transfer one egg vs two. Dr. Forman advised that because of my age I should only transfer 1 embryo. We havent gotten to the tra sfer process yet but I trust his judgment and if the next transfer fails he said he is open to discussing the possibility of transferring more then one.Dr Forman doesn’t believe in transferring multiples in my age range. He says the risk of miscarriage and complication is higher and I believe him I agree with the hospital's policy, multiple embryo transfer may cause complications. One healthy baby at a time.Dr. McConnell had a strong preference for transferring only a single embryo with my situation. I think it makes the most sense because I have only gotten one viable embryo after three transfers. She also doesn’t think that there is enough evidence that multiple embryo transfer increases chances. For me it wasn’t a big deal because I didn’t get many embryos anyway, but I can see this being an issue for others.We haven´t gotten to that on my case but he has pointed out that he prefers single ebryo tranfer to reduce risk of multiples.Dr Forman has a vert strong preference to transfer only 1 embryo if you are &lt;35. I wanted to transfer all 3 embryos due to previous failed transfer but he strongly advocated for 1 embryo transfer since he thought it was very risky to transfer multiple ones. Dr. Forman said he rarely transfers multiple embryos (only in extreme cases). At first I wasn't aware that single embryo transfer was preferred due to the increased risk to mother and child--but after learning a great amount during the course of our journey, I would not see a doctor who regularly practiced multiple embryo transfer.We appreciated the fact that she reviewed the research about the services provided and allowed us to understand the science behind the number of embryos to be transferred at my age and risk factors Dr. Forman supported either decision of 1 vs. 2 embryos as our embryos were untested - but my husband and I decided to transfer 1. In my scenario it was not recommended to do eSET due to my previous corrective surgeries. The determination to do eSet vs multiple was made based on my age, we also only had 1 viable embryo following the retrieval.No comments here. We went into the process knowing that we only wanted eSET, so there wasn't really a conversation.Not up to this part yet. But we will likely transfer one embryo since we did pga testing on them. We planned to transfer one egg based on my age (coincidentally I only had one normal egg to use).As Dr. Stahl is a Urologist, this is not relevant. This is not applicable to meDr. Forman recommended and performed a single embryo transfer, but was open to transferring two embryos had we chosen not to do PGS.With me and my situation we both agreed that a eSET was appropriate. I opt for single transferHe prefers a singleNoDr. Forman explained to me that it would be a single embryo transfer We are doing PGS testing on the embryos and Dr. Forman will only transfer one at a time (when we get there).Dr. Brady suggested a single embryo transfer in our case.My very strong preference was for a single embryo transfer, and my doctor agreed with that approach given my age.Dr. Brady encouraged us to do chromosomal testing through Igenomix, which we did.  From our 8 embryo samples sent to their lab, we learned 6 of our embryos were healthy.  Dr. Brady asked us if we'd like to choose a sex but we are confident in her knowledge and asked that she select the embryo that seemed like the healthiest regardless of its sex.Dr. Forman I believe is a pioneer in eSET and strongly believes in this approach. Dr. Zev Williams wanted to transfer a single embryo, but was not opposed to two embryos being transferred, if we wanted.We only had one good embryo, so we did not have any other choices. But Dr. Brady said that she would still prefer eSET in my case any way. Dr. Brady has been adamant about transferring one embryo at a time for the health and safety of both me and my future child. At this point, I only have 2 frozen embryos left and one didn't make it to the blastocyst stage until day 7 which apparently means it's of lesser quality. Dr. Brady previously mentioned transferring those last 2 together so I am going to follow up with her about that the next time I see her. The normal protocol was to transfer up to 2 day 5 blasts.   I had two good looking ones (undifferentiated cells) and one not so good looking one.   He knew this was my last cycle and asked about the 3rd one.   Since I had been trying for 9 years with no success, I said sure put it in - you couldn't freeze just one so there was no point.   I have triplets.We never wanted to do multiple embryo transfer, so it was never a real issue.  I think Dr. Brady agreed eSET was the way to go. 
Columbia has a policy of transferring only one embryo at a time, which was what I wanted anyway.",8.300000000000006,8.399999999999995,"I do not have a uterus but still have my ovaries. Dr. Forman also suggested some strategies to save both time and money, which was very much appreciated.estrogen priming & aggressive protocol (450 gonal f with 150 menopur) - it did work for me in that i was diagnosed with diminished ovarian reserve and i had 6 mature eggs. At my first retrieval we used 150 gonal
f and 150 menopur with an hcg trigger which produced only two embryos- one day 6 and one day 7 so we decided to go for a second round of retrieval hoping for a better outcome. McConnell suggested we start with IUI -- initially she suggested three, but we ended up moving on to IVF after the second was unsuccessful because Dr. McConnell noticed an issue with the sperm and she didn't think the 3rd IUI would be worth it. I can't remember everything but I do remember that Dr. K. decided to change my treatment and drugs from what my previous doctor had done, so that my eggs would grow at an equal rate and there wouldn't be a variety of mature and not mature eggs during the retrieval. Before doing another transfer, she decided to test my uterine lining a step that felt like it was delaying us further and felt unnecessary. Dr Forman wanted to make sure that we were transfering the embryo at the right time since some women have shifted windows of implantation. This was after having done 2 unsuccessful IUI cycles with Clomid. He was willing to do a repeat genetic panel to confirm the diagnosis. But Dr. Brady said that she would still prefer eSET in my case any way."
5,Columbia University,cost,"My insurance only covered up through diagnostic testing.  I left after the diagnostic testing.  Did not start treatment at Columbia.  Little did I know I would be haunted by billing issues for another 9 months. 

PLEASE CHECK YOUR BILLING STATEMENTS!!  I will highlight 2 issues:

1.)  On my first visit with Dr. Rackow, as you see from above, was delayed greatly, and Dr. Rackow spent approximately 30 minutes with me going over my medical history and then suggested some lab tests.  I was then shuttled off to speak with a nurse who went over when I was supposed to come in for baseline bloodwork, since I was an IVF newbie.  Imagine my surprise when I then got a bill from Columbia for $404 for a 60-minute office visit with Dr. Rackow. They billed under code 99205, look it up if you're curious but I guarantee you the criteria under which the clinic was allowed to bill under that code did NOT happen at my visit. Obviously I did not ""clock in"" or ""clock out"" the visit but honestly the least amount of time I spent at that office was the actual appointment with Dr. Rackow.  When I called the office to inquire, the billing department said they would speak with her and get back to me.  They actually did call me back, only to tell me that Dr. Rackow said she had spent a significant amount of time that I was definitely there for an hour.  I'm not even sure if Dr. Rackow remembered me as a patient and I thought it was pretty impressive that she remembered how long she spent with me.  The ironic thing is when I had another new patient consult with my current RE at another clinic, I was bracing myself for another $400 visit.  My new RE saw me on time, ACTUALLY spent over an hour for the visit, and the office only billed my for a 45 minute visit, which was only $118 out of pocket for me.

2.)  I was double billed by Columbia for lab tests.  Columbia did the blood collection but the analysis gets sent to another lab, typically Enzo Labs.  There was a lag by Enzo labs for some genetic tests since they had to verify  some things with my insurance so I got the lab bill from Enzo almost 9 months (yea....) after the date of service.  I cross referenced it with the bill from Columbia for the same date of service,  which came shortly after the office visit to draw blood (sending out bills is one thing they are not slow about), and noticed that Columbia had billed for the blood collection, as well as for the analysis of 3 hormones, under the same code as Enzo Labs, who actually did the analysis.  I could not believe I had to call Columbia... again.  I thought I was done with them.  Spoke with Sara in billing, who told me that she would call me back in a couple of days to let me know what the credit owed to me was.  I never got a call back, and when I called after a week Sara no longer worked there!  They then transferred to me Sofia Papaderos, the financial services manager, who actually was pretty good about emailing me back at first.  However, I found it strange that the manager could not give me a timeline of when or how the credit would be processed (apparently the credit needs several approval signatures prior to issuance of a refund check, again, something you would expect the manager to know about).  She then proceeded to tell me that an amended claim needed to be filed with the insurance prior to me getting the refund, but Columbia never sent this amended claim, and again, her exact words were ""Not sure on the time frame unfortunately"".  Then I stopped hearing back from her all together!  After over a month of back and forth, I finally somehow just received a refund check in the mail, without needing this so-called amended claim.  The cost was $500 to speak with the Doctor and $5000 for IUI.I don't remember and I still had insurance coverage at that point. My insurance covered most of it. The financial staff at the practice wasn't the best but it was worth it to see Dr. Forman.Thankfully treatment was covered by my insurance which was why I was at this clinicall covered by my insuranceMostly covered by insurance; I just paid copaysThe only additional cost I paid for was elective genetic screening. Everything else was covered under my insurance. Insurance covered the costOnly for co-pays and for blood work that was sent to the wrong lab.$6,300, not including anesthesia. Plus costs of meds.We are paying out of pocket for IVF and medication. All of IUI procedures and costs were covered. They don't have a payments plan for IVF by the way. I thought I read a review saying that they did. My insurance covered all the costs of treatment at Conceptions FloridaMy insurance covered everything, but the patient financial coordinator is wonderful and helps with every step of the financial aspect of treatment. She responds to emails immediately. My insurance covered up to 30k in fertirky treatments and 10k per lifetime if IVF meds .  My out of pocket for 8 IUIs and 1 IVF was about $13k.  I did use donor Sperm so a portion of that was for receiving storage and thawing My insurance covered all of my testing and IUIs and D&C, minus co-pays.  That's one of the benefits of CWRC - they took a lot of insurance.I have GHI.  Most was covered.  I paid 2500 for embryo biopsy for each round.  
I paid PGS testing directly to the lab. Covered by insurance/my job$17,000On my old insurance, almost everything was out of pocket. I paid about $500 per IUI and $10k for IVF. My insurance covered most of it. However, out of pocket, I spent approx. $2,000Very few, because my insurance covered it and they helped me apply to programs that give cancer patients the necessary medications for free.Fortunately, I had fertility coverage under my health insurance. I did have to pay some costs out of pocket up to the deductible. I also had to pay for the embryo freezing and the Genetic Testing separately, these were not covered by insurance. All in, I feel that I paid close to $8,000 out of pocket in total.I have amazing insurance as a teacher so everything was covered except for genetic testing of embryos and cryopreservation. The biopsy was $2500 per retrieval and $100 per month for storage.30K+My insurance covered about half of IUI costs. I believe out-of-pocket costs were about $450.
For IVF, my insurance didn't cover anything.
Cost estimate was ~$17K for monitoring, retrieval/lab, cryo; ~4K for FET; PGT was paid to a separate lab ($250/embryo+shipping).The costs were outlined and explained to me on my very first consultation. My insurance covered 75% of everything.  When we tallied all the costs, after insurance we spent about 15K out of pocket. During our very first appointment, we talked to a financial adviser who clearly outlined the costs of all the procedures, ones covered and ones not covered, with our kind of insurance. We were satisfied with the outcome and the 15K was worth every penny. My insurance covered monitoring appointments and blood work as well as IUI 
All IVF expenses were Out of pocket 
Retrieval medications genetic testing total of 20K
Egg retrieval ~$17K
embryo transfer ~$5K
storage / freezing ~ $2K a year
medications ~$500 - $2K depending on stageCost of IVF with ICIS, PGD and transfer was around $22,000. Medication costs were approximately $5,000 per cycle.I've only done testing this far but I believe s round of IVF was quoted around 16K.IUIs were $660 flat. We had no IVF coverage so it was about $14,000Our insurance covered 95% of everything. We only had to pay some small fees here and there. Unfortunately I do not have any insurance coverage but thus far am pleased with the lack of excess charges I’ve received. I think costs are consistent with the average and I’m still waiting for some bills to roll in. However they helped when they could and even waived one charge.Still being determined.This is all very relative to the patient’s insurance but for me I usually had a $25 copay for the morning monitoring. The IUI costs were largely covered by my insurance per NYS law. I had a few balances I had to pay but it wasn’t much. I also had three rounds of IVF covered through my husband’s insurance, so there were costs associated with that, but again not all out of pocket. The PGS testing was a separate $3000 to a company each time and we had some other costs associated with freezing some of my husband’s sperm due to his travel in zika areas. During my visits at the facility, I had two insurance, Aetna and Empire BlueCross BlueShield, and they both covered my IUIs treatments, etc. Until now, we have only spent about $2000 out of pocket, but our insurance is covering most of it, about 90% of it up until now. We went to Dr Forman after 2 IVF cycles at other clinics. So we had already met our deductible and out of pocket, so our insurance covered most of it. Some high level costs we paid for are:
Medications - $900
Embryo freezing - $1200
Embryo thawing - $700
Monitoring - $250 (combining all co-pays) 
ERA test - $800 (not covered by insurance) Dr. Forman and his practice took our insurance. So the costs were not too bad for the variety of tests we needed. We didn't choose to pursue IVF just yet--so we weren't hit with the huge IVF+ bills.Still ongoing. I dont have that much insurance coverage. So I believe it will be about $24,000. I had considered a more affordable center but the wait times were significant and the level of o ersight was diminished Visits covered by insurance (only kid copay) Out of pocket pay for transfer -about 2,600. My insurance covered $20k for fertility which covered 1 egg retrieval and 1 FET. The meds alone cost $16 k. The remaining 2 cycles & related treatments I had to pay out of pocket which was an additional $20k. My care was covered by insurance. I paid very little OOP. covered by insurance$300 or so in insurance co-pays, VERY reasonably priced.My insurance provided no coverage for fertility treatments.IUI was $700 flat and monitoring appointments were able to be billed through my insurance. We received a NY IVF grant, we paid $7000 up front and the balance of the monitoring appointments not covered were billed through my insurance.we paid 20% of total costs.  So far I haven’t gotten any fertility treatments because of the surgeries. But I was told the cost if my insurance don’t approve me for IVF. I had insurance that covered everything except for Freezing of the embryos.I think the initial consultation was $550 if not covered by insurance. They were very up front about that. Our insurance covers all treatment associate with IUI but won't for IVF if we get to that point. I would definitely work more closely with the financial counselor if we were paying for treatment to make sure I was getting what I needed for treatment and no additional blood draws or ultrasounds.My insurance company paid for IUIs and visits associated with it as part of my coverage. I needed pre-authorization before each IUI.$4,600 per IUI cycleEverything involving egg freezing. They tried to have us pay out of pocket rather than use our insurance benefits. Luckily, insurance covered treatment. However, they routinely tried to bill me for covered procedures or at higher prices than I was told in advance. Sorting it out was almost impossible.Most were covered by my health insuranceI had a 1k deductible for my insurance. I already met that for 2014 before I even showed up at the center. Everything was covered in full by my insurance. My actual IUI cycle in 2015 cost around $450- I only know since it was January and it the first thing to hit my deductible. The sperm was handled separately and I think it was around $100.We didnt have any problems with billingMy insurance covered most of it. However, the iui was around $800 and then I had to pay $50 to intake the sperm that I ordered.It was covered by insurance for us.  I believe that I paid approximately $300/ea. for 4 IUI's. I did have partial insurance coverage. The cost is not yet established since we are waiting for all my labs to arrive in order to take the next step.Each IUI ran about $700 I’m still not finished with my treatment. And I’m also using insurance. The costs were significant and the billing cycles were often delayed. Everything was covered by insurance, so the expense was very reasonable for all of the testing and the surgery. I have my copay at each visit and the rest gets billed to insurance. So far, I have not seen a bill except from the labs. I used insurance and generally had a copay of $20 to see the doctor - I don't believe I had any charge for bloodwork/ultrasoundsRoughly $15,000 for 3 IUIs, and $25,000 for IVF.$5,000 for partial IVF cycleMy IVF cycle was $14,200 with anesthetist and ICSI all self pay. My insurance does not cover IVF. My FET was $4,250. It was very vague and I had to hound them to understand the costs. In the end, everything was covered.i think my total cost was $1800I just had to pay copays.I had the typical co-pays for visitsMedication was about $250
Sperm freezing $660
Every visit - including ultrasounds had a $40 copay$4000 for meds and IUIsDo not recall. After all days and dine appx 50,000My employer covered most of my care so i did not pay more than a couple-thousand for meds and against my deductible.They completely dropped the ball in this area and miscommunicated and overcharged me. I still have not been able to effectively communicate with them to correct this. They were rude and gave me the run around. Approx $5kFirst time in 2014, insurance covered all but the actual insemination. This time, they don't seem to be covering any of itUnfortunately, I don't remember these specifics anymore. I believe my insurance covered the majority of the costs.Do not remember. But this was a consultation only. However, he put the expenses around $30,000 I have a high deductible HSA health insurance plan, and I was seeing Dr. Rudick during the deductible phase of care, so unfortunately for me, all expenses were out of pocket until I hit the deductible.  A typical blood draw/ultrasound appointment ranged between $700-$1000 per visit, and sometimes I had these visits 2-3 per week.  This added up quickly and was a financial burden for us.  We had money saved for this purpose and had planned for the expense, so we were lucky enough to make this work for us.  Overall during the deductible phase I spent $2700 out of pocket for 2 cycles of clomid/trigger shot/timed intercourse.

Once I hit my deductible, I was only responsible for 20% coinsurance, so each visit was between $70-$100.  I became pregnant shortly after hitting the deductible.  For me the price was worth it and I knew my insurance was not great going into the process. My IUI cycles were not covered by my insurance - no monitoring or medication. I now have monitoring coverage but nothing for IVF or medication.We paid copays, and the treatment costs were mostly covered by our insurance. My financial coordinator was helpful in answering any billing questions. I was fortunate that most of my costs were covered by insurance. I don't remember the exact costs, but I believe they are comparable to other facilities that would have been in-network for me.I was lucky that my insurance covered the vast majority of the IVF procedure.  I had to pay about $5000 out of pocket which included the ICSI procedure, genetic testing and embryo freezing. My Cigna health plan covered Dr. Williams as a specialist. Some labs were out of pocket, but then the labs would negotiate rates for patiences without coverage. I didn't pay that much out of pocket for my clinical visits. I didn't need any invasive fertility treatment other than my surgery to remove fibroids which was also covered by my insurance other than a deductible. With my insurance, I had $30 copay every visit.  I have not completed the entire cycle yet so I am unsure how much the whole IVF will cost.  It did cost us $4000 to have our embryos analyzed though.billed amount for Dr Grossman :530.00	amount allowed by insurance$151.00	 amount paid: $151.00. These amounts are higher for Physicians who seem to have more years of experience when they perform my ultrasound. My medications/treatment is not covered by insurance and is paid out of pocket. IUI cost $2649.50$3K to develop a genetic probe
$3K for PGS/PGD testing of up to 12 embryos
$10K out-of-pocket in meds for three retrievals, 1 transfer, and hormones for first 10 weeks of pregnancy
My insurance miraculously covered my three retrievals and transfer with copays, which I'm still adding up--but are probably around $600 (as opposed to the $10K I feared)Insurance covered a lifetime of $30,000 for infertility treatment.  Had to pay deductibles, co-insurance and copayments. But, the clinic have payment options for patients that would need to pay out of pocket.Out of pocket. Insurance did not cover my procedure. PGS	$2,500, Cyropreservation (annual) $1,200, Anesthesia $500,
Igenomix PGS fee	$750. The rest was covered under insurance and required $50 copay for each clinic visit. IUI procedure ($550 per cycle) x 6 cycles = $3,300
IVF meds = $200
Retrieval: $550
Hysteroscopy: $550
Donor Sperm: $4,000
Transport fees: $200
Total: $8,800 (roughly)Around $5-10,000Each procedure has been different so it's difficult to say what each cost has been. Also, my insurance covers some parts of treatment. So far, we have spent around $5,000 total. I spent about 20k total out of pocket, because my 4 IUI treatments were not covered at all under insurance. My IVF treatments were mostly covered. However, I needed to have a certain number of failed IUIs before the insurance deemed IVF necessary. It was covered by insurance except for icsi and PGS testing. And co-pays for monitoring.It was totally covered by insuranceOut of pocket a FET cycle is around $14K, but ideally insurance covers some of that.  A transfer on its own is about $2600. PGS testing is not covered by insurance and is around 4K (which from what I understand is a fairly decent price compared to other clinics)My insurance covered a large majority of the costs, so I just had a $35 copay for each visit. IUI was completely covered by many insurance, IVF was out of pocket.

7,New Hope Fertility Center,doctor,"Dr. Merhi is jovial, and seems knowledgeable about general IVF. But, i'm not confident that he's able to monitor each of his cases individually because of the volume.
He also suggests his Ozone Sauna Treatment (Research) 2 times a week for 3 weeks...but it's an additional $1500.
Dr. Merhi is nice, but nice doesn't do Individualized care as I thought would happen. 
Dr. Olcha was very friendly and cleared every doubt we had regarding the IVF.  He took personal interest at every level to make sure we are comfortable. He even wrote a letter to our insurance explaining our situation for shifting from IUI to IVF. Our first FET was unsuccessful due to unknown reasons which was done by another doctor. He made sure the second one be a success and took every measures to make it success and it did. We are happy, we choose New Hope and Dr. Meir Olcha. From the moment I met Dr. Olcha, I knew I would be in the best hands.  I didn't know much at the beginning of the process about anything and he was so patient and explained everything to me.  During my first retrieval, I had a ton of questions but he answered everything and really made me feel at ease.  My experience was really positive - the medication he prescribed to me for both cycles was so easy - the injections didn't hurt - it was a dream scenario.  I responded well both times and had good outcomes and he was happy with the results and was really with me every step of the way both times.  I am so fortunate to have had Dr. Olcha as my doctor.  He made what tends to be a stressful situation so easy and positive!   I truly have only good things to say about my experience.  I have unfortunately had a long experience with some set backs trying to conceive. Dr Merhi has cared for me since day one and I struggle to imagine a better doctor.

He has been thorough, showed me kindness and I can tell he genuinely wants us to have our baby. No matter how long it takes I would never want anyone else to be in charge of my care.

I would not consider myself an easy patient as I like to understand everything that is going on, ask many questions and the process can be very difficult for me He has never once made me feel rushed or like a number. 

He is thorough, kind, empathetic, charismatic and most importantly extremely good at dictating and adjusting the protocols needed for you to have your baby.Dr. Olcha made the entire process very simple. His expertise, professionalism and personal manner made it very easy for me and my husband. We were more than happy with every detail of the process. The entire experience seemed so simple yet personal. Never did we have any doubt on anything as Dr. Olcha was very good in explaining everything. Dr. Lipkin has a very straightforward way of talking, but more so like someone who knows what she's talking about a not a blunt, rude person. Talking with her instantly makes me feel better because she's so smart and clever, even. She's one of those people who's nodding in understanding before I'm done bumbling through my half-formed questions. She listens as well as she advises, which is awesome. She's a very busy person, but she finds time to call back or meet in person, whichever is most convenient. I'm glad I chose her.I was at New Hope for 2 months before switching doctors (from Lipkin to Dr Olcha…did a review for him too). 
I had a consultation with her and she seemed cold, robotic, very factual which is fine, answering questions with a smirk (ego type of laugh)…I felt like I was just one more for her. 

It was our 1st meeting & not even 5 minutes in she said “You know….you don’t have to take so many notes…we are the experts, you need to trust”. I explained that I do that anywhere for future reference in case I forget. 
When asking about retrieval & if she would do all my procedures she laughed and said “no there is a group of doctors here & depends who is assigned for it that day. But don’t worry (insert laugh)…’it’s a very easy procedure – anyone can do it” (thought it was very unprofessional & didn’t like fact she thought this was a joke. For someone who’s never done this, it’s a pretty big deal specially the 1st time. She did not give me that comfort security feeling at all. 

On our 2nd meeting (which I scheduled since after 2 months I hadn’t seen her yet since our original consultation), I had a list of questions. 
I felt rushed & was trying to get as much in since I could feel her being annoyed. One of my questions was “why where we doing “mini ivf vs. regular ivf?”. Her response was “because we cant create something out of nothing”…after this I froze, felt shocked & realized no point in asking more questions. I felt like crying. I realized then that she did not care for me. She did not believe she could get me pregnant. I was just one more…one more body. 
I asked what was my ovarian reserve & she said it should be 4-5 follicles per ovary so yours is low even for your age”. I asked my new doctor the same question a month later & he said it was consistent with my age (2-3 total). 
Our 2nd meeting was also when I found out by a nurse I was pregnant but when talking to Dr Lipkin 5 mins later as she explained “well you are ..except you are not”…she had no compassion when telling me, just told me I had a chemical pregnancy and happens to a lot of women. I left the clinic and had to google what a chemical pregnancy was since still wasn’t very clear. 

I had a trigger shot & came next day to confirm retrieval. It turned out I had ovulated so missed the chance. The doctor that came in to explain is the one who became my new doctor (Dr Olcha – did review for him here too). She never called me or emailed me. After 2-3 weeks post that event & not hearing from her plus all reasons above, I decided to switch to Dr Olcha & Im soooooo glad I did. The experience has been night & day. 

Anytime I talked to friends who had gone thru this process they would ask me questions & I could not answer. I had lists of questions for my doctor yet felt like I was just one more, going for blood work & sonogram but no real doctor connection, a doc looking out for me & really watching/customizing my case. 

The clinic is super efficient but her bedside manners are not the best.  A friend of mine who had her wife pregnant there said the same thing…bedside manners are lacking. 
Dr Lipkin – THUMBS DOWN big time. Big disappointment, big waste of time.  
Dr Olcha (separate review) – THE BEST! So happy I made the switch. They are night & day & he is pure LIGHT 
Dr Olcha was my 2nd doctor here. He came in to explain how they couldn’t do retrieval the next day (what would have been my 1st) since I had ovulated…Orlissa didn’t work for me. He explained to me in 5 mins more than my prior doc at same clinic had explained to me in 2 months with her. He gave me options (clomid to grow rest of follicules vs timed intercourse which he recommended the later). 

I had a consultation with him since I noticed he was an RE & I just kept thinking of how different (good) I felt with him vs my prior doctor. 10 seconds into the meeting I started crying…it was like all my walls came down & I felt safe…I felt I could ask him and I wasn’t being rushed. He said “don’t cry, you are going to make me cry!”…something my prior doc would have NEVER said. I knew right there he saw me as a person, a human, not just another body. He went on to explain the whole process, calm/not rushed, would draw as he explained, talked in simple terms so you can understand. He looked at my prior results & immediately said what needed to be tweaked. 
On my 1st egg retrieval – it ended up being an empty follicule (Cyst). Again he came to give me the bad news (vs sending a nurse). He knew my plan didn’t cover it & it was all out of pocket so he said he would process it thru my medical insurance as a cyst removal and if they covered it, I would get a credit with New Hope. That was the case which was a $1250 relief I could use towards next procedure. This also was my 1st retrieval ever. He kept me so calm, telling me what he was doing as he was doing it. That helped a lot! He said we would grow the remaining ones (lutheal fase & plan of action)
On my 2nd retrieval, I had 2 eggs retrieved, 1 fertilized. It didn’t make it to day 7. He said he would call me but since we had a consultation he figured he explained 1:1. Again he explained everything so clearly going step by step of the process & where my embryo stopped growing. I literally leave his office with so much hope every time since he explains every step & he has a plan of action already. He makes me feel safe & taken care of. 

He works weekends which is great since less people there. When I get monitoring (blood & sonogram) – I usually see him right after looking at my results & getting to plan of action. He sometimes will either come in during or after the monitoring and answer any questions. He is very hands on. My prior doc I was with for 2 months & saw her twice (1st consultation + a meeting scheduled by me). With Dr Olcha I’ve seem him almost every time I’ve been there & If I don’t, I get very detailed emails from his nurse support team with his recommendations.

Im so happy I switched to him. He is the reason I have hope & feel like I can trust the science. That he is looking out for me & doing what is best for me. Its truly customized & making changes as we go & know more. He is night and day from my prior doc & I will recommend him to ANYONE (I already have). He is the best combination of knowledgeable, calm, compassionate, very good at explaining…..he is the PERFECT COMBO OF SCIENCE MEETS HEART!  I feel so lucky God put him on my path. I trust he will get me there
I had renewed hope after seeing him as he was confident that we could use my eggs as opposed to donor even tho my first RE at the age of 30 had told me I needed to move to donor eggs. What he explained made sense but then I felt rushed into an egg retrieval that I didn’t feel confident would work considering the cycle before (my cycles are very unpredictable) they thought I had two cysts. Then 9 days later they thought they were eggs and good to retrieve and we went in and got nothing. Dr. Zhang is an extremely smart and willing to think outside of the box. I am thrilled I found him when I did, only 1 cycle led to success!! Knowing that he is the owner/founder I understood he would be very busy but trusting a doctor of his caliber assured me to trust his staff.He's very knowledgeable and does cutting edge stuff. However he's not very present. I would like to be able to see my doctor more often or feel like I'm being heard. Most of my questions were answered by ultrasound techs. Also because I understood the plan for the day I have found myself asking for things I was told during the previous appointment, that the people I interacted with on the day of were not awareHe is very nice but consultations with him seemed rushed. He didn't really ask questions or informed us much what was coming next. He started us off with an IUI (natural cycle) which didnt work. We moved on to Mini IVF and he never called, emailed, or followed up with me before or after IVF. At this point I dont even think I am his patient.Dr. Merhi did my transfer that resulted in my little one - so I will forever be grateful. He has a great bedside manner and is very personable and obviously he is skilled at transfers.  A year or so later, when I went back to try for number two, my transfer with him did not succeed (not saying it was anything he did, could have just been the odds game).  Then I decided to try to create more embryos, and had a failed attempt on a cycle. When I discussed the failed IVF attempt, he really didn't offer any tweaks or adjustments to my protocol. It was kind of - it is what it is at your age. You just need to try again and maybe you will get a good egg next time.  I felt like this was a bit disappointment. I'm not sure how knowledgeable he is on the various protocols and research being done in the infertility areas.  As a patient, it’s important for me to feel safe and understood. It’s important for me to feel comfortable with people in the clinic and it’s important for me to feel comfortable with doctors. All that I had just said described Dr. Zhang and his clinic. He listens to our frustration and how much impact it’s carrying us and also financially. Dr Merhi was the first doctor in a long time to try to use my own eggs. I was initially going to him for the egg donor program and he told me to try with my own eggs first. When you are with Dr. Merhi he gives you his undivided attention. He answer all your questions and is very personable. He has great bed side manner and makes you feel very comfortable. But yes there is a but.... here are my dislikes... His email response could be better and yes I understand they are busy but isn’t that a part of your job. Also I went two months without seeing him at any of my monitoring although he would provide instructions via email. I am currently still being treated by him so let’s see. I will give another review when everything is completed.Dr. Merhi is confident and cheerful and I can truly appreciate that feeling of optimism. He did one of my retrievals and it was so painful, but that was perhaps due to a follicule being, as he put it candidly, “in China”. I don’t interact with him as much as I’d like. I really would love more phone calls but I do feel I can assertively seek him out and will be ensured a response. What I says before. She was nice, but not very invested in our success. When we came for the follow up after retrieving the eggs and them being abnormal she hadn’t even looked at the results until we were in her office. Dr Merhi is thoughtful, on top of the latest developments in the field, willing to think outside the box and incredibly supportive. He is very responsive to emails and always made time for me when I asked either via phone or in person. He even dropped everything he was doing on one day to perform an emergency retrieval after my first retrieval didn’t go as planned. He’s been able to adjust along the way while remaining very positive - almost disconcertingly so at times. Very satisfied with him. I trust Makarov's intellect and experience, but felt in the dark quite often about why things were being done the way they were. I liked knowing what was happening and would have to bother the nurses to explain everything. He is very knowledgeable and he doesn’t turn you away if you are over 40. In my case he told me egg freezing should be my number one priority. He said I can make you have a baby at 55 but at 55 I cannot retrieve eggs. Also he suggested MINI IVF based on my endometriosis in which I had surgery for and did a successful retrieval 7 days after my NYU surgery to remove 1 Fallopian tube 2 fibroids and polyp. Dr Zheng doesn’t give up on you and his office is innovative and high tech so they are current in the latest advancements in reproductive medicine. Dr Zhang has a very warm caring personality and he works tirelessly. I do wish he would be open to trying different things when I would for example as for different estrace they would not switch it. I feel like if they did I could have had more sucess.When we first came to New Hope, we had already been told by a previous and hospital affiliated clinic that the chances of us naturally having a family were slim, and to start considering other options, which we were open to.  However, as one last effort, my husband found New Hope Fertility and we were uplifted after our first consultation with Dr. Zhang.  He explained I had advanced low egg reserve for a woman my age, but that would not be a barrier.  I remember him stating that all we needed was one good egg.  He managed our expectations by explaining the process, how it takes time, their philosophy and approach to use minimal drugs, and their team would work with us to accomplish our goal.Dr. Zhang did an excellent job of managing my expectations given my personal circumstances. He was even able to tell me (which he later substantiated via ultrasound) where my fibroids were located based on my description of my menstrual cycles since stopping birth control pills. The RE I saw after Dr. Zhang shared some things with me that suggested IUI was an irresponsible course of treatment for me given the placement of my fibroids. Having said that, I have no regrets about having tried the less invasive procedure because I always would have been curious if we'd gone straight to IVF.Dr Makarov was kind and compassionate and always helped put our minds at ease, even when we got negative results, we moved onto the next step and she assured us that we would get pregnant.  We fully trusted her judgement and treatment.Dr. Lipkin is no nonsense. She’s not the most “touchy feely” but is compassionate nonetheless. I feel like I’m in very competent hands with her. She is patient and answers all my questions. She has also been good about not pushing us to do a retrieval during cycles that didn’t have many follicles. She doesn’t seem stuck on the clinic’s numbers but instead is focused on helping us get the outcome we want.Dr. Zhang and Dr. Lipkin have been amazing during this process and have made every attempt to customize treatment to our needs.  The monitoring experience reequires regular blood work and sonograms which have been difficult however we have been able to adjust the schedule to meet our needs and sync up to the staff that we prefer. The office staff and billing department are very transparent and accessible They push you into not having anesthesia during the egg retrievals at New Hope. I pushed back initially, explaining that my ovaries had a tendency to hide, and that was uncomfortable with just getting an ultrasound. But I trusted them, and did the procedure with only a uterine local. It was traumatizing. They had to bring in a nurse from the other room to push on my stomach to get to my ovary. The constant filling my uterus with liquids made me think of an abortion, which is not what you want to be thinking of when the doctor is retrieving your eggs. They told me it would take 5 minutes, it was closer to 30. Dr. Merhi took a break, as I was in so much pain. He said there were two eggs that he could get to, and I said to just keep going (now I realize that they should have stopped. I was crying and very upset). They kept going, and Dr. Merhi kept apologizing. The egg quality was bad, so neither eggs got past the operating room. Strengths: None
Weaknesses: Poor communicator. It is nearly impossible to understand what Dr Liu says because of his accent. During one of my Hysteroscopy  procedures, he started talking to me in Chinese without thinking that I don't know the language. He doesn't remember your chart and has no clue what he is doing. After my 1st failed embryo implantation, he failed to convey what his plan was to improve chances for 2nd embryo transfer. My 2nd embryo did not implant and he only told me after that it was not a good embryo and had very little chances of implantation.I think he is kind and has a good personality. He does not have the massive ego that a lot of doctors have. However, he is very busy so you won't see him much. Although you can request to see him sometimes and you can pay another fee to get follow up consultations. I really do not know how good he is because he does not explain why he is doing things in this way instead of that way so I can't evaluate the why of what he does or evaluate his thinking skills. I am a person who likes to understand the reasons that decisions are being made so this is not the best style for me. But I'm not sure that any ivf doctors really explain much about their decisions to the patients. Dr. Merhi explains everything very clearly and is always happy to speak with me or email with me whenever I have questions or concerns. He's a little bougie, but always friendly & kind. He does research once a week, which I like. He's paying attention to all the latest research. 
Dr. Liu is very insightful caring and innovative. He doesn't give up in the face of challenges or set backs. He modified treatment plans for the best possible outcome. He communicates with you every step of the way and is always encouraging you along the way.
I highly respected him for his honesty and would recommended him to everyone.Though he got me pregnant with normal pgs girl, I miscarried. And each cycle after that he refused to listen to me or change protocol. I noticed a trend with my labs during monitoring, which I was right about, but he just didn’t careDr.Zaher Merhi @ nhfc, was really empathetic, and knew exactly what I was going through, and I will not name the institutions, I've been to, but 2 big institutions in New York, and one in Michigan,and one of the doctors there told me, you can start thinking about ""Menopause"", and am only 32yrs old, and none of them had the time, or the ambition, even to continue, but here in New Hope, they used the minimal stimulation, and everyone in the clinic was extremely positive, encouraging, sympathetic, and they never let you down, and keep going on, needless to say, they make you pay only procedure by procedure, and whatever can be billed to your insurance they will do so, not like any other fertility center, to which we have been in 3 before, where they want you to pay in full in advance.
Dr.Zaher Merhi, had the best attitude, with great knowledge, and with his attitude, everything was possible.
I would recommend him to anyone, with no reservation whatsoever.
I only saw Dr Zhang once for the initial visit and then for about 10 minutes 1/2 way through my full treatment. Upon my initial visit I spoke with him about how i did not want to experience feeling like a number or that I was in an assembly line, and of course that was exactly what I experienced.Dr. Zhang, was very upfront and blunt about what my expectations should be, in some ways, I as a patient appreciate that.  He is very focused on his research side of his practice, that I think he is too busy to really be focused on the everyday goings on in his clinic.Dr. Zhang seemed disinterested in patient relations and had a formulaic approach to treatment planning. It was my first time seeking treatment and I didn't know what questions to ask. I took for granted that I would be directed toward the best course of treatment and unfortunately trusted his judgment. When I did ask questions based on my own research, responses from Dr. Zhang and most staff were often vague or evaded altogether. For example, I did not have an AMH test, which would have helped me decide whether to proceed to IVF using my own eggs. I was also advised to do an egg retrieval (for $4,000) for just one egg. When I asked questions about both of these things I was given either no answer or confusing information that left me feeling like I was worrying for no reason because this was how fertility treatment worked. When I switched to a different clinic I was advised that an egg retrieval for less than 6 eggs is not worthwhile. I was also told that the genetic testing I did at New Hope (for $200) only tested for 5 markers instead of the recommended 281 markers so I had to repeat it. At the new clinic I had an AMH test and an HSG (New Hope did not inform me about either of these tests) and was quickly able to make an informed decision about my next step. I believe dr zhang is very knowledgable in his field. But he is not for someone that wants a gentle bedside manner. He is to the point and will show you charts/graphs demonstrating where you land on % of success based on your age range. The only times I met with him was for the first consult and then at the end of the cycle for follow-ups.  The clinic did mention that if I wanted to speak with him, that I should arrive in the office between 7-9am, otherwise the rest of his day is booked with new patient consults. It was also other drs that performed my retrievals.  I had wondered if Dr Zhang was the one that was monitoring my ccle progress and adjusting dosage instructions, or if it were other doctors reviewing my case.  hes kind and sweet..very empathic and makes you feel like a special patient. As I stated earlier, hes well versed, excellent fertility doctor, with the added empathic and kind delivery mode. As an older woman, he gives you the facts straight, but while still taking care of my emotional state. I felt Dr. Zhang was very arrogant in comparison to all the RE’s I have seen.  I am a very versed patient and he was my first RE, I was 35 and he tried to talk to me I’m a condescending way.  All the other RE’s I have seen since were 100 times better at all medical conversations. I just couldn’t get out of there quicker. I knew there had to be better doctors and better experiences and luckily when they tried to move me onto IVF I ran for my life.  At the consult they explained how anesthesia wasn’t covered by insurance but also totally unnecessary and not recommended for egg retrieval and I thought that sounded crazy. Never stuck around to experience that. I felt rushed, the service was very generic. There was uncertainty particularly with when I was ready for the implant. He was rushed and I never had the assurance I needed. He was passed over to me in a very dismissive way and his accent was so strong at times, I would have to ask him to email me as I could not fully understand. 
The Dr was nice and very straight-forward. I found the technology at the practice from the waiting room to the email system, nice, but the billing department was a disaster. They overcharged me constantly and even once, held a payment over my head the day before a retrival, saying i couldnt have the procedure done unless I paid the bill. It was only submitted to my insurance a week beforehand and had not been processed. They made assumptions about my plan and charged me for things my insurance covered. It was extremely frustrating. And the lack of seeing a dr was really irritating. I did mini-IVF and we were freezing eggs due to male infertility. They did not explain the importance to freezing embryos vs. eggs and i feel like I wasted a lot of time and money doing treatments and retrievals.  The doctor was unable to communicate clearly with me regarding my diagnosis, and best options, when I was able to actually speak with him directly. There was little explanation ever  given for treatment choices recommended to me or discussion of how I should make decisions about what to do next after a failed cycle. In my first consultation, I saw Dr Zhang two and a half hours after waiting past my scheduled appointment time. I also did not like Dr Zhang's abrupt explanations to my questions. He said mini-IVF was the treatment for me and he was over zealous about my chances of success. I never saw him through the rest of the cycle. I always communicated with his nurses and assistants. The cycle was not successful. I scheduled an appointment to see Dr. Zhang for explanations and answers. He explained that it might be the fault of the doctor or maybe they retrieved my eggs at the wrong time. Then he just told me to try again. It felt like they just wanted me as a customer.Dr. Zhang was difficult to communicate with. He missed a scheduled phone appointment and only called when I emailed him and his nurses about it. After my cycle, I emailed several times with questions and concerns and did not receive responses. In addition, I felt he only gave me information when I was informed and persistent enough to ask for it; if I hadn't been, I feel he would have happily proceeded with me being ""in the dark"" and therefore less able to hold him accountable for my clinical outcomes.Dr. Zhang seemed compassionate and willing to be relatively flexible (immune issues etc). I felt somewhat stressed though, when asking for help to make a decision,  he would not quite help saying it's an elective procedure... He is a loud man with a sharp tone. Nice but you can tell he deals with a lot of people and probably comes off a bit harsh to some more sensitive or insecure types. I liked him. He appreciated my sense of humor and would laugh - loudly and sharply and then I would laugh because he laugh was so direct and funny. Honestly, he's not soft or snuggly type - but he means well, he's got a good setup, he's got a good idea of what to do, and he's willing to try something different that fits. He's a bit of an out of the box thinker and I liked it. My boyfriend and I arrived at Dr. Zhang's office armed with files from my three prior cycles (2 egg freezing, 1 embryo freezing) as well as notes we had taken from consultations with four other reproductive endocrinologists. Dr. Zhang seemed distracted - he jumped from his computer screen to our faces and glanced through my files. When he discussed his proposed approach, its tailored nature made it clear that he in fact had absorbed everything in my files and what I had told him. He had a hypothesis on how to optimize my cycle to increase the number of mature eggs as a percentage of eggs retrieved. We decided to give New Hope a go. My mini-IVF cycle yielded more mature eggs than the conventional cycles.Dr. Merhi was exceedingly optimistic, while also being realistic. He was compassionate and usually patient with my questions. He was committed to my care despite my age (43 at the time we started treatment).Dr Merhi was very warm and provided a lot of details on the day of the initial consultation. He peppered us with follow up emails after the initial consultation. I never saw him in my morning monitoring appointments and he didn't contact me about the transfer, before or after. He is nice. Like the other doctors there, he doesn't really explain why they are using the medications or such. I don't think most patients want to know as much as we do. I'm not sure any ivf doctors would explain much anywhere else either but I don't know.Very positive. Didn’t give up on me while others were directing me towards donor eggs he instituted I would have my own babies and I did. Twice!!! Very smart, very knowledgeable. Not easily accessible though. Recently he has been traveling a lot. Dr Zhang was knowledgeable and confident in his ability to help me get pregnant, but there was a language barrier that made communication challenging at times. I was part of a clinical study and most of my communication came through the coordinator.We only met and saw him for the initial consult. Everything else was done by nurses and other doctors. It's very clear he's a genius and we did t run into any setbacks so didn't really need to follow up with him. We were extremely lucky though and not sure how reachable he was if we needed him.He was friendly, personable, and cared about me as a patient. Flexible and willing to try things that I wanted, even when he didn’t think they would make a difference. Very responsive to emailed questions. Knowledgable and experienced doctor but overall care lack communication and interpersonal care.                                                                                                                       Seemed in a rush to get us to IVF and wanted us to fail everything until that point. Ignored my issues with a short luteal phase; always too busy to answer questions. Would leave us waiting in a room only to later find out she forgot all about us and our appointment was overDr Merhi was always pleased to see us. He explained with many details and examples about all procedures and risks. He was very positive and willing to help us with any doubt or questions we had. We never felt rushed to do any procedure and he was very patient listening to us.He was fine as a doctor, seems knowledgeable. But very very unpersonable. I was honestly very disappointed in the care I received. And he did not even do our Embryo transfer. Just honestly was really disappointed overall with the care that I received from himShe was very compassionate. I trusted that she was able to review past treatment files and understood why I might have changed facilities.  I trusted the facility as it was referred to me by  a friend but I also appreciated that they worked with woman over forty. After reading up about him I walked in there with my mind set. I was going to fully cooperate and trust he knew what he was doing. I have absolutely no regrets. Dr. Zhang helped me create life in the very same body I thought was broken. He is a God in my heart. It was very hard to get any information to Dr. Zhang.  He told us himself that it was like the waitresses (nurses) were not delivering the order to the chef (himself) correctly.  Information kept getting lost and messed up in the process.  We had won a free cycle through New Hope.  However, there were costs they did not let us know about until we arrived at the clinic and we now owe them over $10,000 and still have no baby.  Very impersonal. Never looked me in the eye when talking to me. Seemed like he was always delivering a scripted speech. He never felt warm or understanding. He made promises for follow up phone calls or check ins and never delivered on any of them.Dr. Zhang was very friendly and extremely smart. I got the feeling that he is very busy though and I my biggest fear with New Hope is that I would get lost in the mix. However, Dr. Zhang is very personable, kind and seemed confident with his plan for me. He does not look at every case thoroughly and adjust treatment accordingly. He changes treatment plan with high risk. In one of my cycles, he ignored a dominant follicle and gave me clomid to grow the other follicles. When the other follicles did not grow, he advised to retrieve the dominant one which was 30 mm and rotten Dr. Zhang is a medical genius.  He is beyond experienced and knowledgeable  in everything he does.  He explained things to me that made so much sense and able to understand everything in detail.  I put all my trust on him from the first meet.   She is a very good doctor and she took her time to explain everything to us. She not only shared the clinical aspects of the procedure but took the time to make sure we were feeling ok with the abundance of information. I didn’t feel pressured to make any decision and felt completely comfortable with the choices that we did make. She was excited for our success, which showed at every visit and ultrasound. Very compasionate and caring
Really wanted the treatment to work. Help me accomplish my dream of motherhood! Gave me free medications when I was unable to pay for it myself. I would really like to go back and try for baby number 2.
Good at follow up and full of passion. But he seems little pushing us to start 1st cycle even though medication and genetic testing stuff are not ready. He is also super optimistic but i am not sure that was his personality or being realistic. Very cerebral approach- not a hand holder but able to produce results- differentiated process from other big treatment places in nycPoor communicator. Zero compassion. He doesn't speak English very well. And is very blunt nonetheless. He has a very specific theory -- low dose meds for only retrieving a few eggs (what they say are ""the best"" eggs). May be a good place for poor responders.There were certain costs i felt were unecessary, but NH worked with me to adjust the bill. While my plan at the time was to freeze my eggs, I would have liked time for a one on one discussion on my infertility issues in depth. Dr Zhang is very knowledgeable and did not push any extra procedures. He was straight to the point. He explained everything that was going to happen. If i needed to speak to him in person he was usually around in the morning when I was having monitoring.It's hard to assess the doctor because so many things have gone wrong but it's unclear if they were her fault or caused by bad communication and poor planning by the practice. There have been times where we've felt jerked around, unprepared, and misled. Throughout it all she has been kind and caring but our confidence has eroded.Dr. Makarov was very knowledgeable and professional during my entire process. I trusted her and I got the results I wanted on the first try! I’m very satisfied. I would recommend her to anyone who is interested in doing the ivDr. Merhi is a wonderful and caring doctor. He made a very emotional and upsetting process more accessible and lowered my stress. He always made time to explain things, I would wholeheartedly recommend him! Any time I asked to see Dr. Merhi, I was scheduled in and able to do so. Only once was he not there and so his team scheduled a phone consult appt with him and he called the very next day. I specifically requested him to be the Dr. to perform my last/most recent IVF transfer with donor egg and sperm, and he made sure to schedule me with respect to his availability. He left no stone unturned to give me all the meds, scheduled appt.'s, consults, etc., to make sure we succeeded this time! I feel he took no issue with my age (47) and was 100% on my team with absolute assuredness we would succeed. If I had any questions, he would slowly spell everything out for me in a respectful way...even drawing pictures/charts for me in his office. We did succeed and he was genuinely SO happy for me!We initially began the IVF journey at the New Hope clinic with another doctor. However, my OBGYN doctor had recommended Dr. Merhi, and I had felt put off by some of the communication with the other doctor, so we decided to switch to Dr. Merhi. I am so grateful that we did. Along our journey, there were definitely unexpected twists and turns -- a smaller number of eggs than expected reacting to the stimulation medication, a need for me to have a hysteroscopy done, uterine lining not thickening up to the desired level by the scheduled date. While we had direct consultations with Dr. Merhi at only some of these junctures, with every one of these ""setbacks"", Dr. Merhi implemented some kind of solution-oriented strategy to try to obtain a better outcome. Sometimes this meant just continuing medication and waiting a few days for the situation to change, and in other times it was really about building the best possible conditions for a successful transfer. I knew that he was personally checking my charts after every monitoring session I had, so I felt personally cared for. 

I am a firm believer in doing my own research and making sure that as a patient, I always advocate for myself. I also knew that I could express my worries or doubts to Dr. Merhi and his responses were always honest, but comforting. Is the IVF science perfected for pregnancy to be guaranteed each time? Of course not. But having a doctor who is truly your cheerleader and doing their best to strategize the best scientific road to success is crucial.Dr. Merhi reviewed my history and on our first visit knew immediately what the challenge was.  He caught and diagnosed what was missed twice, by another very reputable IVF clinic.  It was confirmed during surgery and he corrected the problem.  We had gone through 11 unsuccessful IVF's and 3 IUI's at another facility and had just about every test imaginable.  We were told there was nothing wrong but there obviously was and hadn't we seen Dr. Merhi, we believe we would never have discovered the true reason for the infertility.  And now that is had been surgically corrected, we are pregnant!After being told by a different doctor that we would have to use donor eggs in order to get pregnant, despite me being 33 years old and having gotten pregnant with my 2 other children without a problem, we did more research and found New Hope and Dr. Zhang. During initial consult, Dr. Zhang went over the treatment plan, which was just going with my natural cycles and using Clomid to control timing of ovulation. Dr. Zhang told us we’d be pregnant in 6 months. We went through 6 retrievals with 4 viable embryos. Had the first transfer with a 5day frozen embryo and got a BFP! I am now 33 weeks along with a baby girl and have 3 more embryos on ice. I call Dr. Zhang our miracle workerDr. Merhi was always so kind and encouraging. Even when I got news that wasn’t so great (when I learned of my low AMH, failed iuis, etc) he presented information clearly but when a gentleness that made me feel like he always cared deeply about our goals of growing our family. When our transfer worked he shared in our joy and excitement.Dr. Merhi is kind, compassionate and very professional​​. He listens​ to you and proposes​ the best option. Dr. Merhi is confident and cheerful and I can truly appreciate that feeling of optimism.  Dr. Merhi, is a very skilled, knowledgable and attentive doctor. He listens to the patient and is not interested in personal results and stats but is genuinely interested in the well being of his patient. He has excellent bed side manners. He makes himself available to answer questions and is very reassuring. He also matter of fact and practical. I am now 13 weeks pregnant, I plan on returning to Dr. Merhi for my second pregnancy.After my partner and I suffered years of infertility and loss, I prayed to god that he send us an angel. That Angel came in the form of Dr. Olcha. If you go to NH, & you want a Dr. that is intuitive, compassionate, caring, motivated, & will tailor a fertility plan based on YOUR body, your hormones, your #’s, & the right timing, then I please advice you to go to Dr. Olcha. He got me pregnant my 1st round of a FET cycle. I am now nearing my 3rd trimester. I thank him for this rainbow baby that will soon be in our home. He responded promptly to all my emails and actually took the time to call when I needed answers. He is an amazing Dr. and an even better man. Dr. Merhi was very patient and understanding of my circumstance and ultimately what I had gone through and what I was planning to endure to have a baby.  He shared different information with me and had a sense of enthusiasm to work along with me, which encouraged me even more. I would have like to have had more one-on-one time through-out my journey. 
When I walked into New Hope I knew this was going to be different for me. I was treated like an individual and not like ALL the other women. Dr. Zhang recommended a hysteroscopy and when it came back positive we found why my three other transfer at another clinic were not taking. After taking antibiotics we proceeded with our transfer and IT WORKED!!! I have a beautiful healthy and strong daughter and now pregnant with identical twins and I owe it ALL to Dr. Zhang and his amazing team!!!! I’m so glad I went for a second opinion and I’m so glad I joined New Hope!! Thank you for giving me my perfect family! Dr. Merhi was very hopeful when we met him even though we’d had five failed cycles with two other doctors. We were surprised by his optimism but what won our trust was that he told us what he thought hadn’t worked in previous cycles. He had a completely different philosophy about medications. He felt I’d been given far too much medication and claimed he would not use one very standard medication that I’d been given in 5 other cycles.My doctor is the best there is, hands down. He is straight to business. He's also incredibly intelligent. When we had complex issues with how to create a value proposition to my insurance, he was nuanced and sharp enough to help me do that. her strength: Shes precise, knowledgeable , very skilled , very friendly, humble, and so passionate about her job.  She obviously knows her work and knows what she is doing. She is so quick to give details and handle the patient. She is never hesitant! 
Honest, compassionate and very knowledgeable about his expertise.
I never would have believed him if he told me I will get you pregnant but he did and was extremely gentle with the whole procedure.  He’s wonderful at his job.Dr. Zhang's clinic is running in a very efficient way. Professional and fast. He clearly told me and my husband what he can do or cannot do. He is very straightforward. He doesn't just say things to make you his patient. I have tried the other ""famous doctor"" before I went to him. I would say although the procedure itself is painful and lengthy, you will spend the least time in Dr. Zhang's clinic compare with the others. They are professional and have a efficient way to run their clinic as well. I highly recommend. He is one of the best doctor New Hope has. Very patient and when doing Egg retrieval he focus on retrieving max numbers. Also when transferring the embryos he is very delicate and ensures its placed in best position to implant The facility works very much like a mill. Your name pops up on a screen when you are supposed to go to one room or another and often when you arrive as directed, the nurses don't know why you're there.New Hope is great with being ""hopeful"" about their goals, protocols, volume and results. 
However, there have been several occasions with my care that I had to speak up in regards of the lack of clear communication, protocols not clearly communicated or explained, Not willing to try other protocols or explain why, The OR not getting proper communication before my procedure. Over billing, Labs not ordered, RX not called in, and getting a different RN who doesn't follow my case closely each week. 

I expressed my frustration and disappointment with several emails, and one of the sonogram techs had to pull me aside to tell me how things are done. And how to navigate to survive the process. 
Considering the volume, I felt like I was treated like a number Dr Olcha  treated us very nicely and always there for us whether it's a sonogram or consultation or any questions. He never hesitated to answer any question whether it was face to face or via email. Dr. Olcha is the best doctor.  I always felt like he was giving me his full attention - he was always in the office when I would go in for monitoring the mornings.  I think he works everyday because I would always see him which was so lovely.  He could always come in to my scans and give me feedback right there which was really helpful for me because I like to be informed.  Dr Merhi ALWAYS has treated me as a human, Remembered details about me and has been completely on top of my care at all times, even when he is not physically in the office.Dr Olcha has been an amazing doctor for me and my husband. From our very first meeting up to gratulating with babe at week 9 he has been thorough in every detail. We have always felt very comfortable with him and so happy we decided to have him as our primary doctor. Every step he been a breeze for us due to his calm, professional and very approachable manner. Without him we would not be where we are today. I would definitely recommend him to those many couples who are struggling with fertility. Thank you! Dr. Lipkin's pretty awesome. She's smart and a whip, was very patient, and answered any and every question I asked in our in-person talks. If it ever felt impersonal, it was due to the having to use New Hope's email service as communication between visits. Sometimes nurses respond instead of Lipkin for things that they could handle. But, for the important things, Lipkin made sure to call me in a timely manner and I always feel comforted afterwards. I feel like I'm in good hands and that I'm not broken.Like a # with her.

I had a consultation with her and she seemed cold, robotic, very factual which is fine, answering questions with a smirk (ego type of laugh)…I felt like I was just one more for her. She is not tactful, her answers are short & she wont tell you anything unless you ask. She gives you the minimum (information wise). I

When asking about retrieval & if she would do all my procedures she laughed and said “no there is a group of doctors here & depends who is assigned for it that day. But don’t worry (insert laugh)…’it’s a very easy procedure – anyone can do it really” (thought it was very unprofessional & didn’t like fact she thought this was a joke. For someone who’s never done this, it’s a pretty big deal specially the 1st time. She did not give me that comfort security feeling at all. 

On my consultations with her - I felt rushed & was trying to get as much in since I could feel her being annoyed. It was very clear to me every time I was just a body to her...didnt get the feeling a)she was doing her best for me or b)even believed I could get pregnant. He actually cares. I feel he is customizing & tweaking everything based on most recent results. he takes time to explain everything & make sure Im at ease & understand everything. When doing my retrieval (my 1st ever) he explained to me every step of the way which kept me so calm. 
I know the difference since my prior doc treated me like a #. Dr Olcha is night and day from her & Im soooo happy I switched to him. His team is very responsive and he has great bedside manner and remembers personal details about myself and my husband. It is a very busy clinic, I met with Dr. Zhang once and did not develop any relationships with the staff. If this were my first clinic or cycle I would be put off but at this point I just wanted results I did not need hand holding.I saw him three times so far, most information gotten from the nurses and ultrasound techs around me. Things felt rushed with him, not much of a personal touch in my opinion Dr. Merhi was wonderful with consultation. However he did not due my retrieval, didn't follow up with me whatsoever, and basically was almost non existent throughout the process. A Dr. Zhang I believe was the one to do my IUI and my retrieval.One of my main criticisms of New Hope is that you don't regularly see or speak with a doctor. You mainly work with the nurses -- via email. So it feels impersonal.  If you make a request and the doctor is available during monitoring, Dr. Merhi for instance would come into the room and chat with you. He is very personable and kind and treats you like a human for sure.  From all other fertility clinics we’ve been to, New Hope was friendly. Dr. Zhang and staff were friendly and organized. They saw me as a human being not an object of someone just coming in for treatments. They understand our frustration and our pain. We’ve also endured two stillbirths. They know the pain and heartache of losing two precious babies and trying again and not working. Dr. Zhang is there to questions that’s needing answers. He is always available to talk to without paying...he understands!I wouldn’t say Mr.Merhi treated me like a number but more like the clinic. Dr Merhi always addresses me by my first time each time he see me. New Hope is a bustling and big clinic. I had come from an experience with Dr. Joseph Davis at RMA which was intimate and human to human. Dr. Davis left his practice and since I had frozen eggs with NHFC, I am now with Dr. Merhi. I really appreciate his cheerful optimism and true willingness to try with me. Although the place is high paced and run like a machine, I feel confidence in the practice. You only spoke to her when you were there. She seemed very h concerned with the results. We have 13 eggs retrieved in our first cycle using the shots. None of them came back normal. She never addressed that, it was just onto the next cycle with no discussion. She was nice when you were in the office why her, but felt very detached from our success Dr Merhi is kind, communicative and responsive. He always gave me information directly l, and at times bluntly, but emphasized his belief that we will have success. She's on the 3rd floor, not the 4th which feels like a mall during busy times. People remembered me, and answered my emails. It’s a very busy clinic with a flat screen TV that you look for your name to get blood drawn, sonogram, and billing. They seem concerned about billing as they want you to pay first. If they made you pay last it would have a different vibe. They seemed to have a certain protocol and they often made mistakes. I would have to call in and they would agree it was an error then give me another protocol. also they were resistent to try different that what they do. for example I was not responding to oral or vaginal estarce. i was desperate to try the patch. they would not prescribe it. I awitched clinics and now my lining is perfect with the patch. I just need a good egg, still in process with new clinic.When we first came to New Hope, we had already been told by a previous and hospital affiliated clinic that the chances of us naturally having a family were slim, and to start considering other options, which we were open to.  However, as one last effort, my husband found New Hope Fertility and we were uplifted after our first consultation with Dr. Zhang.  He explained I had advanced low egg reserve for a woman my age, but that would not be a barrier.  I remember him stating that all we needed was one good egg.  He managed our expectations by explaining the process, how it takes time, their philosophy and approach to use minimal drugs, and their team would work with us to accomplish our goal.Dr Makarov was so patient and took as much time with us as needed.  I know that some other doctors in the practice do not always see their patients, but she saw us each time, unless she was on vacation or out of the office which was very rare.  She answered every question we had and was always friendly.Dr. Lipkin is personable and takes the time to answer all my questions clearly and thoroughly each time I meet with her.Dr. Zhang has regular personal check ins and provides adjusted treatment practices to make sure we are being treated personally and in a sensitive way.Talking to Dr. Merhi for our inital consultation, he was fantastic. Warm, personable and seemed to be very confident. After that, I was basically handed off to nurses and not allowed to speak to the Doctor anymore. Plus, the waiting room is like an upscale DMV. The staff and doctors at New Hope are just trying to process your blood work and sonogram. They don't take a look at your history and don't remember which medications you have been taking. Dr Liu was never available to answer my questions or guide me about the approachThis is a very busy clinic, which allows them to keep their costs low. They are much cheaper than any other clinic I have contacted in America and I have called many. Because of their high volume, I don't think they really have time for a lot of very individualized attention but they do their best. Dr. Zhang is really very nice. All their doctors are very nice. The nurses are hit or miss. Dr. Merhi always found time to speak with me whenever I asked. And he always responded to my emails quickly. I felt like my protocols were always specific to me and they never tried to fit me into a general protocol. Most of the nurses are great. Not every day was perfect but most were just fine and efficient. Dr. LIU is the most positive and motivated fertility doctor that I hve ever met. He passes along his enthusiasm and profound insight onto his patients. He is honest caring and very proactive always trying to tweak treatment to get the best possible results. As a woman in her 40's with DOR and tubal related infertility, I had gone to another fertility center where I was always left feeling discouraged and told on several occasions that I should consider donor eggs. I made a decision to leave this other reputable clinic and opted to give New Hope and Dr. LIU a chance. I'm glad I did. From the very beginning I was treated with the utmost respect and care and was told for the first time that I could have a baby using my own eggs. At first I was skeptical after all I had been told at the previous clinic but after 2 ivf cycles with Dr. LIU, I was able to create 3 embryos. Dr. LIU has encouraged me every step of the way and even when  I said that maybe I would consider donor eggs, he said no ..I believe you can have a baby with your own. This brought tears to my eyes and hope to my heart. Dr. LIU is very passionate about helping his patients no matter what their medical issues are. I appreciate him and everyone at New Hope they truly gave me my hope back when I was in a very dark place. I am trying to gather financing for 1 more ivf cycle/transfer  so that we can finally try for our baby. Dr. LIU is someone I would highly recommended to anyone. He is innovative and always encourages you to believe that anything is possible. 
Never got to speak w the Zhang. 
Nurses wouldn’t even call you. They send you an email with your instructions. If you have questions it’s impossible to get in touch with them Dr.Merhi, was so passionate, and positive, and that was one of the main factors, that made me continue with himThere was never a time that I could speak with the doctor and there were way too many patients at once. At times the nurses weren't helpful; which led to the feeling of not being satisfied.After the first appointment with Dr. Zhang, I was basically put on auto-track for the 3 cycles I did with NHF.  Never was there a change discussed after any cycle or summary/thoughts, unless I asked to do something different.  The office is very streamlined, and efficient, so much so, there is a lack of personal interaction.  Also, I had had a bad experience with the staff from my first clinic, without any thoughts to my feelings a doctor that treated me from that clinic should up at an egg retrieval at this clinic, since this procedure is timed, I felt I had no choice but to allow him to do the retrieval.  I almost did not go back for the next cycle I was so distraught.    I had hardly any face time with the doctor and was never given any explanation of my test results or prognosis.The nurses and techs working in the clinic were always professional and courteous. I understood the dr was very busy as the clinic was always quite busy and crowded, but I would have liked more face time with the dr since most emails and correspondence on next steps were always from nurses. I have been at NHFC for a few years..first egg freezing mini ivf then fertilizing my frozen eggs. Dr Zhang is more blunt and honest and well versed in the science.. but he could work in softening the delivery. I like that he doesnt sugar coat bc i trust him. Dr Liu is well just better at delivery, more empathic to what we are going through as older women. He makes me feel like a woman in his family and that makes me feel hopeful-while hes still remaining very honest. Hes a gentle soul. After my initial consultation I never saw the doctor again.  The waiting room was a zoo and wait times even with an appointment were crazy. None of the receptionists or nurses knew me. Dr. Zang was my original doctor I had received consultation and during the retrieval process. I was switched over to Dr. Liu last minute and he knew nothing about it me and it was apparent. Once I had an initial consultation, it was almost impossible to have a conversation with a doctor about my treatment. I once waited three hours for an appt with a doctor after I repeatedly requested an appt and was finally given a time. 1) Waiting for an appoint with Dr Zhang always took a long time.
2) A different nurse contacted me after every ultrasound result to provide instructions. At other clinics, it was always the same person. New Hope felt impersonal.
3) The egg retrieval was impersonal. I was just told to take everything off from the waist down. In two other IVF clinics I attended, you took all your clothes off under the gown. 
4) No anesthesiologist checked on me to ask about allergies or medical conditions. When it was my turn, they were running far behind schedule and they acted very rushed. It did not sound like they were going to be careful.
5) Dr Zhang was not the attending physician during egg retrieval. It was someone else. Dr Zhang never told me that it would be another doctor. I never saw Dr Zhang. This was a shock to me. I had never met this other doctor before, and he never introduced himself to me. He just asked me how many follicles I had and if I had IVF before. That was all. He never bothered to read my patient history. 
6) No doctor came to talk to me after the retrieval. No one else told me what happened. I was told that I can go home. They never checked if there was someone to drive me home. They never gave me any water or food. That was a horrific experience.Once I started my cycle, I had no routine physician interactions-- just interactions with the phlebotomists and ultrasound technicians. When I did interact with a doctor because I had questions or concerns, it was because I specifically asked and fought for it.Dr. Zhang seemed to be sufficiently attentive, and receptive to my concerns  (whether age, costs, immune issues etc). I actually think his idea of minimal stimulation works well for older women.Well, while some people didn't like how the clinic was set up (very structured) I found it calming. I always knew where I was in the process, everything was on site so there was no waiting for blood results, the nurses were freaking awesome and always used butterfly tiny needles to make it less painful, the women were always nice. The only drawback was sometimes I couldn't get through to the financial people. I mean, it's a clinic - not a hotel... but it went above my expectations with one disappointment when I told the Dr not to put me on the pill (hormones) and he did AND it was the only cycle that didn't work at all. Had they listened to me, the patient I could have had more eggs. It was stressful and it's hard and the waiting is not easy, but it is what it is. New Hope provides a typical big city medical experience. I wouldn't expect Dr. Zhang to recognize me in the waiting room - it's a busy place! His protocol was the most successful one for me, and that matters most to me.Dr. Merhi, as my main physician, always made me feel well cared for, but at his clinic, they had an on call system and I never knew which doctor I would see on which day.Dr Merhi did not even recognize me when I saw him in the clinic after the first initial consultation. When the transfer ended in a chemical pregnancy, he did not reach out to discuss next steps or share condolences. During the initial consultation he assured us that he would be the only doctor performing any procedures (transfer, water sono, practice transfer) on me. He didn't care to tell me the week before my transfer that he was not going to be in the clinic. Neither did he return my email after he returned to the clinic (which was after my transfer).I like Dr. Liu. Like Dr. Zhang, he has a kind and respectful demeanor and he does not have the big ego that a lot of doctors have. He has a lot of patients so it’s hard to get personalized attention from dr. Zhang. He is also always traveling but he is a great doctor.  Very knowledable and positive. When others told me I will need donor eggs he never gave up on me having a baby with my own eggs. And it happened twice!While I had limited time with Dr.Zhang, he spoke with me cordially and exuded a confidence about my treatment and prognosis for success. He seemed to genuinely care that I was successful.We had success on our first try so hard to complain about anything but our biggest challenge with the clinic was calling off hours to get info. Sometimes the nurse would leave a voicemail with instructions that I'd have questions about and it was seemingly impossible to get anyone live on the phone. Very stressful at timesDr Mehri was always familiar with my case and what was going on when we spoke.  He was personable and empathetic.barely saw the doctor, only came into the clinic to do blood work and ultrasound and communicated with others such as RNs through email. Communication through email was not always responsive. I needed to know why after each cycle, I still haven't conceived yet and if there were any concerns in regards to my fertility health but was not communicated to me. Poor communication and not an interpersonal clinic. Mixed up our blood work. Didn’t seem to understand my historyI was always called by my name and Dr Merhi always replied my emails promptly giving me detailed explanation of what I asked.I've never felt more like a number than at the clinic with Dr. Merhi. I literally met him one time while walking in the door to the procedure room to do my egg retrieval. She explained each step in laymen terms.  She was able to repeat things so that i completely understood them and was very empathetic to my feelings.My treatment was catered to my need and everything was clearly explained. Not once did I feel like a number. I was treated like a person and my feelings were very much considered. We were just shuffled through the doctor’s office.  My monitoring results got misread and it was very, very hard to get a nurse or doctor to respond to our emails or calls.I saw doctor zhang for initial appt. Then I never saw him again, until I waited 2 hours one day to see him, even when I had an appt. His focus is on getting new patients in the door. Not care of existing patients.I got the impression that New Hope is a very well run factory. I felt shuffled along and sort of lost along the way.Not looking into each patient case.I felt like a human because Doctor Zhang and entire staff cared, listened and answered all my questions.  She took her time to explain all the options we had, told me the options she would choose and shared personal stories of her own pregnancy.I was able to use donated medications after I was unable to pay for it myself. So grateful for all the support provided! They spent a good deal of time with me during the appointments and during follow up calls and emails  I never waited very long to be seen.  Dr. Zhang and New Hope Fertility was the worst medical experience of my life. You wait endlessly. There's no compassion from the staff. They continually forgot about my medical conditions. bedside manner, eh.My doctor took time to sit down with me and address any concerns i had, and followed up with a direct phone call to see how i was doing and If I had further questions or concerns. I felt like a human because I always had my questions answered through emails.Dr. Merhi was always attentive and made time to answer all my questions. While monitoring can feel more like a number, I always knew Dr. Merhi was behind my care and available to speak. With Dr. Merhi, I felt listened to and respected. I felt he took the time (never rushing) with me to help me really understand every step. He helped me feel like no question was too ""dumb"" and he was very positive and encouraging. I read folks' energy very well and he was very sincere with me. He was not in it for the money and taking me for a ride. I felt supported and nurtured.Speaking directly with Dr. Merhi always felt very personal -- he is honest, but also has excellent bedside manners, which I believe is super important during the entire stressful IVF process (especially since I found myself very sensitive every step of the way!). Dr. Merhi is one of the most in-demand doctors at the clinic, which means you'll always have to wait a while to consult with him and he doesn't have a lot of time. However, my husband and I ALWAYS felt that we were respected and treated well by Dr. Merhi. It always felt worth the wait just to be reassured by him, and to really feel that he was (is) genuinely determined to help us obtain success in our IVF journey.Dr. Merhi was very kind, easy to speak with and made himself available when we had a question last minute on the day of the transfer.  We felt and knew he had our best interest at heart from the moment we met him and were confident in his knowledge, experience and diagnosis.Dr. Merhi always explained the process clearly and compassionately. He listened to my questions and answered them with care and thoughtfulness. Any time I wanted to see him he made time for me. He was kind and gentle with his delivery of all types of news.Dr. Merhi was kind, compassionate and very professional​​. He listens​ to you and proposes​ the best option.He responded promptly to all my emails. Exhibited Very compassionate & caring Behavior. The nurses and doctors were quick and thorough with their responses, which allowed me to not stress about the process.Unlike my previous doctor, Dr. Zhang treated me as an individual and not like all other women. I liked that very much.Dr. Merhi was extremely warm and attentive with us whenever we saw him. I don't care if I'm a number or a human. I now have a baby. All I care (and cared about) were results. They could do a better job treating me like a human - but it didn't bother me. She is very friendly and always shows up with energetic smile. She is so humble and knows her patients. The only negative thing I can say is the employees having clear communication between all parties patients and within their environment.He is very knowledgeable and understand every person different based on their situation ",6.899999999999998,6.899999999999998,"Dr. Merhi is jovial, and seems knowledgeable about general IVF. I had a consultation with her and she seemed cold, robotic, very factual which is fine, answering questions with a smirk (ego type of laugh)…I felt like I was just one more for her. He managed our expectations by explaining the process, how it takes time, their philosophy and approach to use minimal drugs, and their team would work with us to accomplish our goal. But he is not for someone that wants a gentle bedside manner. He was committed to my care despite my age (43 at the time we started treatment).Dr Merhi was very warm and provided a lot of details on the day of the initial consultation. Dr. Zhang recommended a hysteroscopy and when it came back positive we found why my three other transfer at another clinic were not taking. She is so quick to give details and handle the patient. He clearly told me and my husband what he can do or cannot do. Considering the volume, I felt like I was treated like a number Dr Olcha  treated us very nicely and always there for us whether it's a sonogram or consultation or any questions. I mean, it's a clinic - not a hotel... but it went above my expectations with one disappointment when I told the Dr not to put me on the pill (hormones) and he did AND it was the only cycle that didn't work at all.

8,New Hope Fertility Center,advice,"Stay on top of him, and make sure you go to monitoring 7am-9am if you need to talk with him. Other than that you're left to random Dr's or RNs sending follow up emails. Make sure, you are open to Dr. Olcha and explain him all your concerns and questions so he could treat you accordingly. My advice to a prospective patient of Dr. Olcha's would be NOT to worry.  He's the best!  You can't go wrong!  Book in with him as soon as you can. You will not regret it.

Expect that at New Hope the doctors often work as a team effort so know that even if it doesn't seem that you see him often, he is still always reviewing your results and making decisions.Please pick him as your primary doctor. He is simply the best! If I needed fertility treatment again: he is my number 1 option! You won't see her all the time, so take advantage of your meetings and calls with her. Have all your questions prepared. She knows her stuff.She has no bedside manners, not compassionate. if you care to have someone who has your best interests, actually cares, is compassionate - I would NOT go with her. 
Advice - schedule consultations once a month or whenever you need them since she wont....she relies on nurses to send email with recommendations but not much personal touch/interaction from her side. Ask him anything. He will explain and you will feel so much better after. He has great bedside manner but I am unsure that he really has the best course of action as a physician. He is willing to try unconventional things. Do your own research, bring your own questions and take a chance!Ask for a full explanation of the pros and cons of each step or procedure Be prepared to not see him, he will not follow up with you. Do your research, ask a lot of questions, demand that a specific doctor follow your protocol. To always trust your gut feeling. Listen and ask millions of questions. Email! Email! Email! Would be your best form of communication with him. Prepare yourself for a big clinic. Alter your expectations if you think this will be a more personal exchange. I am having a very different experience than I had with Dr. Davis of RMA but I believe in the clinic’s competence. Keep on top of everything. Make sure they are giving you the proper information and that you get it on time. Be persistent. He will make time for you but you need to stay in front of him or connect with his coordinator to get on his schedule. He is very busy so don’t be afraid to push!Keep notes of questions you want answered at the visits. After monitoring she has to run elsewhere, and doesn't have time to discuss side effects, make predictions etc. On one hand, it's nice not to have a ""performer"" giving false assurances, on the other, it would be nice to hear some positive thoughts on the process. Make sure you have the time to put into the process because right before egg retrieval you have to go to the office for daily monitoring which is time consuming. The office runs well like a well machine you can be in an out and they have great refreshments. It’s a very comfortable and nice office.write everything down keep track of what is working and not working and compare what protocols they give each cycle so you can make sure you are getting the best result.I've learned the entire process takes patience: between waiting for your cycle to start, bloodwork, sonogram, egg retrieval, success of fertilization, success of embryo going to Day 3/5, the ups and downs during any of those steps mentioned, patience & perseverance is necessary; surround yourself with the best possible support team - from Dr. Zhang and team of doctors and those in your personal life to support you during this journey.Make sure to ask all of your questions and ask her to be honest with you--she will be and will answer any question you have.You need to advocate for yourself at New Hope in general. If you have questions or want to meet with Dr. Lipkin, ask. It was not offered as often as I would prefer but whenever I requested to meet, I was able to do so fairly quickly.The mini IVF process is a more gentile process than standard ivf and can take more cycles however it is less intense.  I would suggest patients visit New Hope Fertility Center first before they go for a full IVF round at another clinic.Dr. Merhi seems like a very nice person, but DO NOT GO TO THIS CLINIC. What they do and what they say are two very different things.Do not waste your time to see him. This is a busy clinic. It can be frustrating sometimes as a patient because you can feel like a widget on an assembly line. On the other hand, there are some ways that they automatically personalize the service in ways that other clinics do not. For example, you get to decide for yourself whether you want to use sedation for egg retrieval or not. I prefer not, which saves us $500 each time. I also do not like sedation so I am happy I can choose not to use it. Most ivf clinics will not allow you this choice. I have inquired at many clinics and 99% force you to use sedation even if you are only retrieving one to three eggs. I do not think that is a reasonable approach and I think it is disrespectful to the patient to take away their right to make medical decisions about things that are not truly a necessary part of a procedure. I think allowing the patient this choice is part of the general approach of respecting the patient so this is one of the things I love about New Hope.Be clear about your priorities. Dr. Merhi will make best efforts to accommodate. When visiting Dr. LIU it is best to be as informed as possible about your specific needs and concerns. Dr. LIU will answer all of your questions with detailed explanations. He almost gives you a mini lesson in such a sweet way if you truly want to understand something more in depth. Bring all your questions no matter how insignificant they may seem he will be happy to answer them.Listen to their concernsIf you have a problem with fertility, please do not shop around, big names can fool you sometimes, go to Dr.Zaher MerhiNot to expect too much communication. That you will have to do a lot of your own research. Make sure that all of your tests are done and be your own advocate. Be prepared for a very academic discussion, and don't expect any type of handholding.  There is very little direct communication with this doctor, the rest of the team will be your main contacts.I would not recommend this doctor.Ask all your questions, be straightforward, dont expect hand-holdinglisten carefully,,he has an accent so speaks slower..Demand better  and more personalized care.Ask for Dr. Zang instead. Push for information and check your bills very carefully. Go somewhere else, if you are seeking treatment with doctors that can provide regular, and clear communication.  Go somewhere else.Make sure you understand the clinic's approach to egg freezing (i.e., low stim) and it aligns with your own expectations and priorities.I became worried by the end that they do not monitor closely enough and I think they don't. It might make sense to come a bit more frequently, especially in the beginning of the cycle, so they adjust the drugs better.I would say - just relax and ask questions. If he seems hurried or distracted (because he does have a lot of patience) it's OK. He'll take the time. Also, don't expect one doctor to solve all your problems, this is something you need to take control of yourself and get educated. What you want is a good treatment and good caring team. He's got so many ways to get you want you need, tell him your concerns and listen to him. I did seriously the most non-aggressive treatment and it worked for me. He listened to my problems with hormones and the fact I don't take the pill because of it and didn't make me do the intense treatment. That was MY choice and he went with it and gave me options. It may not be an option for everyone, but I met with 5 other doctors and he was the ONLY one willing to think out of the box and offer different cycle treatments. I love how he puts focus on one good egg, not a bunch of bad ones... that is all that matters in the end. One good egg can come from just three oocytes. Remember that. Advocate for yourself. If you have questions, keep calling and asking until you get a response. The nurses are extremely helpful. The office is digitized and nurses provide instructions via email. Email is not a good way to contact the office with questions though - call and keep calling if you aren't getting a response.Ask lots of questions and request to see Dr. Merhi for consults and updates between cycles.Find a different doctor.I don't know.Don’t be afraid to tell them you disagree with their protocols or if you feel uncomfortable with a dosage you can tell them to adjust it. They listen to what the patient wants. They are flexible and they have an amazing lab!!He's a fabulous doctorfor difficult cases, mini IVF or other unique circumstances. He doesn't turn people away. And I was confident in his ability to help me achieve my goal of pregnancy Ask all your questions up front, do your research and come prepared. make sure you request that he (and not the general team) follows your case. dont expect to be updated about course of treatment and explained why certain procedures are done. Don’t leave the room until you have all your questions answered. Request some medicated cycles first, especially if your insurance doesn’t cover IUIAsk questions, be honest and sincere and Dr Merhi will help you the best he can. He’s very knowledgeable and will follow up with you along the way.Try someone else.Be completely open and honest about what you want and what her expectation for you are based on how you present.Trust he knows what he is doing. Never question and the instructions . Do your research!Go somewhere elseKnow that you will be seeing ultrasound techs and not the doctor very often. Don’t put lots of hope.Listen!Ask whatever questions or concerns you have and she will give you an honest answer.Listen to what he says. I know from personal experience that we don't want to hear the word no or it may take time, but the journey is long and you need to be prepared to deal with the setbacks Go here if you have an aversion to over medication or if you want to try a less aggressive ivf approach Don't go. Find out your numbers (AMH, FSH) before deciding whether New Hope is for you because they won't deviate from their protocol.Clearly communicate with the doctor regarding short and longer-term fertility goals, and about any issues you might have. NH is flexible and can work with you. He is straight to the point.Ask lots of questions. Ask in the beginning what days Dr. Merhi is at the office location you prefer. He goes to two (I think) different locations every week. Be bold with requesting exactly what you need and ask every question you have! Make sure you ask to specifically meet with him. When you do monitoring during their daily hours (7am-12pm), I would get there on the earlier side if you hope to catch Dr. Merhi after your meetings with bloodwork/sonograms. It helps if you do your own research and have specific questions for him re: your own protocol and needs.Dr. Merhi is busy, busy, busy. There is always a line out the door of patients out the door to see him. If you choose to be treated by Dr. Merhi, I would suggest:

- Communicate! Be open about what are your concerns are with your cycle.

- Do your own research and always advocate for yourself! Prepare your own questions so you can best make use of the time at the in-person consultations.

- Don't be discouraged if you can't always see him in person. We would occasionally see other doctors for consultations just for questions or concerns, if we couldn't see him.
Dr. Merhi is kind, compassionate, funny and extremely knowledgeable.  He may not always be available as most doctors cannot be, but his staff is great at getting back to you. He does call and reach out which was great, as our previous doctor  didn't typically do that.    We felt he was also on point with all the new technology, studies, standards of practice etc and did not subscribe to anything that was not proven or did not have statistical significance.   Be patient with the treatment planDo not feel the need to interpret every test result- Dr. Merhi will let you know if levels are abnormal or of concern. When monitoring you may not see him as often, but he is still absolutely pouring over the data and making smart decisions based on what he sees. Trust his judgement.Follow the instructions and advice from Dr Merhi and the outcome of your expectation will be great as expectedAn amazing Dr. best Doctor at the practice. You may not get enough one-on-one timeTrust him and his team!He is very trustworthy and truly cares.Trust the process but if something feels off then ask and ask until you get an answer. To keep up the good job she is doing! Have faith in your doctor and follow what he tells you and trust the process.He will make it happen. Have hope in his regimen they really work",6.899999999999998,6.899999999999998,"Stay on top of him, and make sure you go to monitoring 7am-9am if you need to talk with him. Alter your expectations if you think this will be a more personal exchange. Find out your numbers (AMH, FSH) before deciding whether New Hope is for you because they won't deviate from their protocol."
9,New Hope Fertility Center,nurse,"Oksana and Joanna were my primary nurses and they were so helpful when in explaining next steps and answered any questions that I have.  They were always so knowledgable, kind and compassionate.After I asked about communication improving, they seemed to make an effort. But, went back to their old ways. I don’t like how they run their clinic. You wait for your name on a board and go in to get your blood then back out and wait for your name on a board and back into a different person for the sonogram and then back out and the nurse talks to you and the doctor if you request. The nursing staff there is fast and efficient. Monitoring is a breeze. If you go early youll be in and out in no time. The coordinator sometimes responds a little late but she is very nice.Limited contact with my assigned nurse. The nurses generally communicate via email which is convenient, though it can be very difficult to get someone on the phone at times. Oksana was the main person I met with, but quite often emails would come from whoever was on staff, even if I never met them before. They would try to be detailed and when they would send emails missing information, I would have to ask for clarification, and they would send it. This part was frustrating, just send an email with everything a patient would want to know. Disorganized and awful. The nurses (there are more than I can keep track of) all send you different emails. You ask them a question and the all give you different answers because there's no communication. Terrible!!! Awful!!!! I would expect the doctors to be cold, and nurses to be warm but frankly it was the opposite here. They send you a generic email with instructions. It’s a template. If you have questions they won’t answer you. And if you call them the receptionist (liliana) will never connect you. 
While I was miscarrying in the ER, I’m hysterically crying, in my stretcher and I call them to let Dr Zhang know ... Liliana answered (the receptionist) and said “you are no longer a patient here”. (I was 7 weeks and never discharged to my OB). As I’m crying in the phone, begging her to connect me to my dr she continues to passive aggressively tell me “I graduated” and was no longer a patient there. 
Long story short —- after that traumatic experience, I made a formal complaint the following week. The supervisor told me liliana had put in her resignation the week prior so “that’s probably why she was behaving that way” .... fast forward two months, Liliana is back. I speak with supervisor as to how she can work there with how she treated me and refused to connect me, a patient, to my dr while I’m in the ER miscarrying. The supervisor said “we gave her extra training afterwards”

Terrible. Need I say more Nurses were great and skilled at blood draws. I have tough veins and they were good98% of the nurses were extremely helpful and responsive to my questions and concerns especially after my egg retrieval and embryo transfer.  Joanna Tudisco by far was the most accommodating and thoughtful nurse when I emailed her over 5/6 different times concerning my bloating.  The team as a whole is one of the best and I would surely recommend them to my friend/family member.All the nurses who work were very understanding and compassionate ",6.899999999999998,6.899999999999998,Oksana and Joanna were my primary nurses and they were so helpful when in explaining next steps and answered any questions that I have.

10,New Hope Fertility Center,clinic,"convenient location, flexible monitoring time, staff are friendly. Weakness are some time they are little careless when it comes to treatment/ medication/ testing.  Billing department is so difficulty to communicate.  You have to be your own advocate. They routinely give contradictory information, give you urgent instructions to take medication they haven't bothered to prescribe, and leave you teetering on the brink of messing up each cycle.The nurses and staff were very helpful. Always there to assist in any questions or issues. They were very kind and knowledgeable.professional and friendlyThey do everything by email which is fine unless you have questions. often times questions go unanswered, i had meds not called in, and problems not addressed because you dont have a dedicated nurse. The volume is too high and they are not responsive via email and i have often called 3x to get someone on the phone to only be told they will call me back. I went into a procedure without having antibiotics or anxiety meds i requested  more than 3x. It was totally unpredictable whether you'd wait for 10 minutes or 30.Clinic is very clean. Staff are very knowledgeable and helpful. They are equipped with everything you need. The hours of operation work perfect with my work schedule. The medication I was able to get right at the office.Dr. Zhang's clinic is running in a very efficient way. Professional and fast. I have tried the other ""famous doctor"" before I went to him. I would say although the procedure itself is painful and lengthy no matter where you go, for the same thing, you will spend the least time in Dr. Zhang's clinic compare with the others. They are professional and have a efficient way to run their clinic as well. I highly recommend. Nursing staff doesnt have the best bedside manners. Emails are detailed and easy to follow (its a clinic thing not linked to the doctors per se) but did notice Dr Olcha has a separate nurse support group (smaller group so more hands on vs all the nurses for the full clinic)The facility was clean and the staff was clearly competent. However, there were frequently billing errors so that's something patients should focus on. New Hope was not in my insurance carrier's Center of Excellence so I paid for all care out of pocket.Pro- high tech, convenient location, smaller, more friendly than other clinics, sat hours for cyro and other appts
Cons - Disorganized billing, no dedicated dr or nurse, you never see a dr, Waited 3 HOURS for a transfer once with little updates or sympathyI got to know the nurses the best at all the fertility clinics. They are very skilled, knowledgable and professional and can answer most questions. The team of nurses were always prompt to send my monitoring results with instructions. Any questions I send they always respond within a day or 12 hours. clinic with experienced doctors and nurses. they try to be professional and compassionate. the clinic site looks well maintained. But truly lacking in interpersonal communication and you will be left in the dark about the plan of treatment even if you are in the medical profession. The clinic feels like a 'baby mill'.Most of them did not speak very good English, they were very hard to understand, and they didn't understand me very well either. They were very very unpersonable, and very very uncompassionate. The language barrier was a huge problem, but their lack of caring and concern was almost worse.Always got a different nurse. Not one nurse knew who I was, even after 4 rounds. At the time of treatment Dr. Luk was actually working at a different clinic. She was part of New Hope Fertility and I had a great experience there. They were great at communication about all the test results and ultrasounds. The nurses and staff were friendly and polite which makes a big difference.Compassionate, responsive and personable.  They all knew my name, story etc.  loved them all. The clinic seems organized despite all of the other failures of New Hope. very busy never had same nurse.Nurses at New Hope went above and beyond in terms of communication and procedures. The monitor hours at New Hope are really great! I found it really hard in my previous clinic to only have monitoring hours early morning, but New Hope has until 2pm and are usually pretty quick. Don't get thrown off at the New Agey decor, it's a great place, plus great location.  All of the nursing staff were very friendly, compassionate and responsive to questions and concernsThe nurses that I dealt with were very compassionate and kind. And great at their job!!I had positive and negative experiences with the nursing staff. Most communication is via email and it was hard to get an actual nurse on the phone to provide clinical advice.You will be called within 10 mins of your check in time. They were very gentle while drawing the blood or while doing the sonogram. They made sure, we are comfortable at every step.The nurses were AMAZING.  Everyone was so friendly and helpful.  They really helped me with any additional questions I had.  They were so patient in showing me how to inject myself, etc.  All of the nurses are amazing at New Hope!  New Hops nurses are a wonderful group of women. They are thorough and attentive and always pleasant to deal with. Sometimes it can be a challenge getting a response from them but you can always call and speak to someone or send another email and that always does the trick. They are a very busy clinic some days.The nursing staff are a great reflection on the clinic. Each and every nurse are super nice and attentive. Any time I had the most simply question they were are very helpful. My emails would also be responded to in a timely manner. I must say the nurses are a great contribution to the clinic and the great work that takes place there. Well done! I will miss seeing your familiar faces! It's a mixed bag, but overall good. Some phlebotomists could be gentler and have more experience with lighter veins or darker skin. The nurses answer questions in a pretty timely way over the email portal, but there were a few times that were frustrating. I've had to email for further clarification on directions given by nurses. Strength - very organized, efficient, great billing department, great front desk staff, great hours/opened weekends, 

Weakness - nurses bedside manners are lacking. 
Advice - do your research on the doctors & maybe have a consultation with a few to figure out best match for you. I stayed too long with Dr Lipkin. I've understood more & been taken care of more by Dr Olcha than I did with Lipkin. I usually deal with those who draw blood + the sonogram. Nurses usually just email the instructions (after you leave). the ones I have dealt at the clinic, some are very dry/no bedside manners....one told me I was pregnant (instead of letting doc tell me...it was a chemical pregnancy)...i saw her again 2 weeks later & she didnt even remember me (even do she did a big mistake). Aside from getting my blood drawn at the first consult, retrieval and transfer, the only interaction I had with the nurses was with email. During the stim cycle they are very responsive. During transfer and ongoing pregnancy the email communication isn't as responsive, could due to the number of patients, vacation time, patient priority.  The nurses are all very professional in person and email.Very clean and calming atmosphere. Things move very fast there. There's a whiteboard which flashes your name and also guides you on where to go. Everyone is courteous but it tends to feel very impersonal since they have so many patients. They also communicate mainly by email which can be a good thing. Questions are answered promptly. I would also say that costs are very reasonable there.The relationship with the nurses at New Hope is quite odd -- mainly just via email.  You hardly ever get to see them bc they are not drawing the blood or doing the sonograms.  Generally difficult to get a nurse on the phone.  I have had it happen on a number of occasions where I receive conflicting emails info from nurses.  Also it has become a big hassle to get your prescriptions called in. They email the protocol to you with your meds and you say, please call into X pharmacy and they respond ""please email [insert email] regarding prescriptions.""  Seems like we shouldn't be worrying about this and that the calling in of prescriptions should be handled better.  Caused a bit of stress for me bc I had to repeatedly follow up on prescriptions being called in. We started seeing Dr. Zhang back in 2016 and we are still doing that:) the staff are wonderful. When I come in they know me and don’t need to tell them my name. They input it on their computer and they know I’ve already arrived. During blood work monitoring, they know I have thin veins and they are careful. Nurse are available to talk to and few I’ve met and talked to. They are super nice, cordial and you ask them anything even if it’s embarrassing or disgusting. The sonographers I absolutely love. They know our loses and they are so sweet. They talk to me about how I’m doing and how my day is going. They always try to lift my spirits. Other doctors on site are fantastic. They are friendly and you can ask them anything and they are there to help you. Nurse after my transfers, super sweet. You feel comfortable and they don’t rush you to get up and leave. The staff during transfers, they give me instructions what to do and they are caring too. The embryologist I meet during transfers, super nice and friendly. They show me my embryo on the screen and they really check to make sure it is me and I understand exacting what is going on. Doctors who performs the transfers are friendly and I can ask anything even though he is busy doing what he needs to do. Sometimes the provide incorrect instructions or dose mix ups and drug mix up. Also I received my email really late in the day Nursing staff is more communicative through the patient portal. I was slow to understanding this and therefore felt frustration when I wasn’t getting phone calls. Generally the staff is kind, one junior doctor (a female) is not compassionate. The ones they took your blood were very nice. They had the most compassion out of any at New Hope. When ever I had questions they were always available to answer in person or via email They are very compassionate and kind. but the disconnect was waiting f or your protocol instructions it always took way longer than they said it would sometimes the next day. it was frustrating, sometimes they gave me a protocol that I felt was off. I would have to call in and every time I did they did say they made an error and would correct it. It was difficult because I felt like I should be able to trust them but it was maybe too many patients. I don't know.When we were ready to try for our second child, the doctors and nurses were helpful at helping my body re-adjust, as I had just finished breastfeeding and was not consistently in a menstrual cycle. I trusted their advice.  Also, seeing the same nurses from our first time, and the fact that some of them remembered us, we could sense how invested they were in our journey as well.  
Overall, I was very happy with the clinic.  Aside from the great care that I received, It was always so clean, and well organized.  Karen at the front desk was always so warm and sweet.  I never experienced any doctor or staff member to be rude or nasty.  Of course when you are going so often for monitoring and treatments, you may have a bad experience at some point but that's normal.The nurses have been great about walking me through the IVF process and helping answer everything from the “is this normal?” vein of questions to helping me schedule travel around upcoming IVF steps. While it can be difficult to get hold of nurses on the phone at times, they are great with email response and also in person. We have had several nurses really go above and beyond to help explain things and take time with us during this processThe nurses are available to discuss treatment and review directions or protocols.  There are a lot of nurses at New Hope and there is no 1 single nurse you will communicate with. I had a different nurse every time I went there or someone who sent me a protocol for medications. If you have any questions, the nurses are not very fast to respond to/ get in touch withThe nursing staff seems very busy. Some of them are nice but a couple are uncaring and downright rude; these ones may not have much empathy for the amount of money the patients are spending or the mental stress of being infertile. In our case, we have spent all of our savings and then had to stop making attempts and then saved again for almost a year to try again because for us it will be a numbers game. The doctors said that my fertility is unusually good for my age but our chances of a baby are better if we can freeze several embryos. We will never regret using all our savings for this and all future savings. However, it is a big sacrifice and it is an all day round trip drive for us every time we go there. I also suffer from extreme motion sickness so when we arrive at the clinic, I am always feeling very ill. Everything about undergoing ivf on a budget is extremely difficult. The doctors seem to understand this but some of the nurses often seem to lack the maturity to understand what the patients are experiencing.Many are great. Some are more chatty & personable than others. New Hope does a lot of monitoring, so I definitely had favorites. I have found the post retrieval nurses to be my least favorite. They are inattentive & occasionally rude. This may be due in part to a language barrier and cultural differences. The nursing staff is very diligent in answering questions ordering medication and making sure that you have everything you need to undergo treatment. 
The Nursing staff, were compassionate, positive, very responsive, and makes you always feel, that things will workMost were nice, and competent. There were a couple that were very responsive and got back to you quickly; while the others were more curt and I felt viewed me more as a box that they needed to check off by the end of their day.The nurses were all very pleasant and all had good beside manners.  However, because you are not assigned to a particular nurse, there is no one to directly to talk to if an issue arises.  One nurse, Gina, was quite attentive and compassionate. The rest were somewhat robotic.Nurses were very friendly and helpful in clinic, but were a little slower in response via email. One time they emailed me regarding medication dosage and I replied back to them and needed another refill and did not hear back until the next day, which was a problem because I needed the medications the night beforegreat professional women. i like them-but they could be a bit better at talking a bit more with patients. But i guess since the place is always busy they dont have much chit chat timeThis one. It’s did help me once when I began to cry because no one would tell me what to do with the needle the handed me and told me to give myself for trigger.  She was so sweet.  All the other nurses seemed coldThe office itself operates like a well oiled machine. There was no consistency with nurse staff. I was passed around and couldn't depend on any one person to answer my email etc. Monitoring was easy. The hours were very expansive so you didnt have to rush to be in line like other clinics to be seen in a small window.  There are no assigned nurses, just a rotating group who will work with you when you arrive for monitoring, etc. They leave you emails with instructions and follow up, and if you try to ask a follow up question, you may not hear back from the same person. The ultrasound and blood work were okay. The problem is that I was contacted by a different nurse every time when the communicated the ultrasound and egg retrieval results. One nurse did not write English well. It was hard to understand. 

During the egg retrieval day, there were no nurses to take care of patients. She just put on my patient bracelet and left me to wait for my procedure. They did not take my vital signs. No one took my blood pressure.  Afterwards they did not give me any water or food. They just told me to leave. They did not ask if I came alone or if there was anyone to drive me home. There was minimal communication and it was all impersonal.I had minimal interaction with nurses.Most of the nurses are very good and compassionate. 
However i had problems with nurses, 1) they would not give me clear answer about medication/consequences -- as a result i had unexpected reaction etc; 2) one of the nurses, who does not seem to work there any longer, advised me not to take a pain relief medication before procedure -- i came into the office for prescription. As a result i suffered great pain during a procedure and after the procedure, for about a year various pelvic floor problems The nurses varied from day to day, but all of them were nice and helpful. Some got me in on days that were difficult. The clinic has monitoring every day from 7am-2pm. You just show up when convenient for you. This was a HUGE benefit in dealing with my work schedule. However, be prepared to wait as long for monitoring as you do at other places (budget an hour if you need bloodwork and ultrasound).Competent and efficient.The clinic's environment is very nice, calm and bright with daylight. There is a big electronic screen that shows you when your turn is up. The office is also conveniently located across the street from a subway stop. The appointments with their doctors are always over 1 hour wait. NO RESPECT for patient's time. When you ask where the doctor is, they tell you the doctor is in the OR. They are busy. Some of them are nice and some seem to not to have much empathy or understanding of the sacrifices and difficulties of being infertile and paying for ivf.they are friendly and helpful but can take a while to answer your questions because they are so busy. Very busy, not particularly empathetic, and hurried with relaying information. Still kind and professional though.Bloodwork and ultrasound nurses were very pleasant. There were some communication issues (protocol mix up) when emailing with nurses for instructions. Lots of people, they never spoke to us unless it was to tell us to hurry to the next roomQuick and efficient! Very friendly and helpful.Very few of the employees including the doctors spoke very good English, the culture and language differences were huge barrier in my opinion. My husband and I were treated like strangers, outsiders... Honestly more like cattle being loaded on a train than human beings trying to have a baby.I had a very hard time finding my veins. they were excellent and patient.Always respectful and kind. The nurses were very disorganized and made me feel like just another patient they had to shuffle through.Strengths - innovation. Weakness - everything else. Go here if you want zero compassion and empathy and want to be treated like cattle. They dont treat patients like humans, but like a number or a bank account. No quality of care whatsoever.They seemed very confident and kind.Well organized but not much of an emotional supportI absolutely loved the entire nursing staff.  Any questions I had (and I had many) they answered it with a smile.   Very nice and professional
 Made me feel very comfortable every time I had an appointment You sign in on a computer when you arrive-   very pleasant room with nice music lots of light snacks  etc     always was seen fairly quickly less than 20 mins typically The clinic was very clean and had state of the art equipment and procedures were run with the utmost professional staff. I am completely satisfied and highly recommend this clinic to anyone that is looking for top quality service at an affordable price. The nursing staff answered each and every question I had. They were helpful with the entire process.It took many, many visits to realize who my favorites were, honestly. Some of the blood drawers weren't great (read: painful needle insertion!), and others - I felt nothing! Some of the sonogram technicians (NOT nurses) liked to pretend they really new a lot about medical needs/advice - which was not great for a ""newbie"" like me in the beginning of my journey. Make sure you are talking to a NURSE when you have questions. Also - if you get the feeling the nurse does not know the answer, ASK for a meeting with Dr. Merhi! Also- Dr. Merhi has a specific nurse team! Ask for the Merhi-Nurse Team email for emails communications (merhisupport@...). I definitely had my favorite nurses there. Sometimes, the nurses' lines re: my specific protocol were crossed and I had to confirm something 2 or 3 times with DIFFERENT nurses before getting Dr. Merhi's actual correct answer. This was mostly through several email exchanges and strategically CC'ing different nurses. Never apologize for needing an answer if you feel you're not getting what you need. Call! Email! Again, some nurses are way more experienced and clearly-spoken than others. You'll start to realize as you go along. Never hesitate to ask for a meeting with Dr. Merhi if you really need.You'll see the nurses for your regular monitoring -- drawing blood and sonograms. The nurses are often rotating so on occasion I would see a few nurses that I recognized and had grown friendly with. Some nurses are not as friendly -- some are colder and just trying to ""get it done"". However, this made me appreciate more the few nurses/sonographers who were just more sensitive to my situation, taking care to look carefully at the results, and to answer my questions. One definitely develops preferences for some of the nurses over others. I am extremely grateful to one sonographer who managed to carefully inspect my results and discovered that I would need to have a hysteroscopy to remove a growth before the FET.

The nurses are very good and there are several monitoring your progress.  Most of the communication is via email.  They are very responsive on email and if/when you prefer or need to speak live, they are there for you. Since I've gone through many cycles previously, I knew what to do, aske and expect.The clinic’s strengths are:

1. Convenient hours for monitoring 
2. Cost - cost of IVF cycle is the same as cost of IUI cycle in other practices
3. Treatment plans are truly based on the patient
4. Clinic is very well organized (everyone is on the same page)
5. Easy access to doctors 
6. Clear and concise treatment plan and instructions 
7. Facility is clean and well maintained 
8. All parts of the treatment, from consult to embryo transfers are in the same location

No weaknesses The nurses were incredible. Responsive, thoughtful,  and detailed in responses. The nurses drawing blood in the lab were the best I’ve ever worked with. Now when I get blood drawn elsewhere I realize how truly special they were.The nursing staff were great and very supportive, but in some cases their email response never happened, a follow-up phone call yielded no response until I went to the clinicNursing staff was ok. I love how they treat us women as individuals.  The office is warm and inviting and a true positive space. I don’t have anything negative to say about this facility.... and I’ve recommended New Hope to many people and I will continue to do so!We are grateful to New Hope because it is the one clinic where we got a a healthy Embryo and did a successful transfer. That being said, there was far less interaction with doctors than at other clinics and much more with ultrasound technicians and nurses via email. They're great but understaffed. very organized, friendly and humble Friendly Strength: 
Rates for unlimited monitoring good.
Time to get monitored good.
Ultrasound Techs Nice
Volume 
Egg Retrievals are done in both phases including Luteal-so that no eggs get left during retrieval.
The OR team very efficient, compassionate and nice.
Billing Team very efficient.

Weakness:
Bad with communication

Strengths would be: The clinic is well staffed. Whether it is for blood work or sonogram or Insurance and billing help. I don't think they have any weakness. Al the doctors are well experienced and really helpful.I have nothing but great things to say about New Hope!  The offices are beautiful - right on Columbus Circle - it's large and spacious and very calming (I love the fish tanks!).  They really know what they are doing and are so professional.  I researched other places before deciding to go with New Hope.  What they do their is so impressive!  I really think they are the best at what they do.  I have not one bad word to say about New Hope and I have (unfortunately) been a patient for a long time. as I am doing mostly natural cycle, which can take time.

They are busy, clean, well located and run like a well oiled machine. Some people could feel overwhelmed at such a busy clinic but I do not at all. I am familiar with many of the staff now and it is a pleasant experience going there. Excellent daily monitoring hours.Everything in the clinic is amazing, from the doctors, nurses, staff, waiting area, soft music in the back ground and even the light scent in the air makes coming to this clinic very easy. I have always felt very comfortable coming to this clinic and enjoyed every visit. Also knowing they have teh bat staff and technology I never had a moments doubt that our treatment here would be successful.Strengths: They're efficient, overall friendly, and many of them genuinely feel like they want the best for us. Their numbers as far as pregnancies and IVF cycles are great. Their operating hours are unmatched, even during COVID in the city. It's right next to many trains in Manhattan.

Weaknesses: The scent of the office is strong, too perfume-y. The ads on the televisions should be more diverse, not just white babies. Some people may feel their efficient way of meeting patients feels assembly line-ish. Their billing department could really use more help.Strength - 
Very efficient. You are in & out in 30-60 mins. I have time to get to work before 9am. Never a long wait
You come in, check in, then look at monitor which tells you chair to draw blood or sonogram room. After you get email with instructions & next steps. 

weakness - some of the nurses & Dr Lipkin (no bedside manners)....need a little bit more compassion. My doc is great so it's worth it for me. The way they treat patients through a cycle. You check in and then wait for your name to show on the Tv screens and go in for blood then back out to wait for your name on the tv to see a different nurse for ultrasound and then back out to wait for the nurse (coordinator) to call you back to discuss and the doctor if he is available. I don’t like this approach it makes you feel like a number. But Dr. Merhi’s team is very responsive through their email portal. Location is good however the first time I could not easily find the building. Also, the security needs to know the difference between floors 3 & 4, a few times I was directed to the wrong floor. Clinic itself is large and clean. Nice refreshment station and the best part is the salt water fish tank. The reception desk individuals are very welcoming.The clinic is amazing as a whole. The monitoring is very self explanatory and easy. You go in and wait for your name to come out in the screens, and they tell you exactly where to go. I liked the facility and the ease it hasThe wait time for regular monitoring and sono is pretty short -- they run like a well-oiled machine in this regard.  They also have good hours 7-2, so it doesn't interfere with work too much. I do believe that the lab / embryology dept. there is quite good and the folks working in the lab are top of the game -- you can email them as well with questions and they are responsive.  Herminio (in embryology) is really great and compassionate and helped us through some stressful times. I wish there was more interaction with your primary doctor - -in fact, I didn't even feel like I HAD a primary doctor at all. I sometimes felt like maybe nobody was really focusing on my protocol.  Again, I did have success at New Hope in 2015/2016, and it is more recently that I've grown concerned about the level of care I am receiving. NH could potentially be a one-protocol kind of place -- not sure how customized the treatments are.  The cost at New Hope is also much more reasonable than other places, so that's a plus (assuming of course you are getting the care you need and want). The clinic is amazing. There are more patients than ever. The clinic’s atmosphere is friendly and open. The only weakness I have to say is to really be a bit more organize on some areas. For example, I had done bloodworks already and they kept asking me for particular blood work reports which I had given. They’ve asked me Numerous times and I keep being copies for them. Whoever scans the documents, they need scan better and put it in my file. At one time only, a nurse emailed me my blood work result and protocol. The meds she told me was to take clomid. But that’s for retrieval. I was doing transfers. So one nurse emailed me and corrected it. Also, I keep getting ask if I’m
Allergic to medications. I did tell them so many times yes and gave them the name and still keeps asking me. It’s ok. I learn to answer each time:)Billing sucks, they don’t get back to you ever. You literally have to harass them. Communication with the nursing staff isn’t the greatest. But the clinic is a well oil machine in a good way. You can be in and out of monitoring in 30 to 45 mins which is great for people who have to work. Very clean facility and the staff is nice. It’s very conveniently located too. I wish that someone had provided a personal orientation to the clinic! It’s so hard to navigate these places under high stress and alone. I didn’t understand processes and felt overwhelmed by self advocacy and confusion. You are a number. Especially if you are upstairs. The receptionists do not care that this is one of the most sensitive things someone could go through. The actual office is lovely. 
You must keep on top of them and insist on the treatment that you want. If you call and want to speak with a doctor they will tell you it’s not possible. You have to insist and make a scene. They almost had me cancel a cycle because on my retrieval day they had a mistake in their system saying we owed money. We didn’t, we paid the full amount the day before. They were causally looking into it until I insisted that I get my sonogram so they can do my retrieval. One tech said sorry, if you haven’t paid we can’t do anything. She was so rude. Especially because we did pay. They never apologized. Nice facility where treatment is MUCH more affordable than other NYC area facilities. They bill as you go, so you don’t have to plunk down the full cycle costs when you start. Very flexible monitoring hours - 7am - as late as 2pm some days.  It can be a bit of a factory at times, and there have been a few days where I’ve had to wait 45-60 min for monitoring. Clean, beautiful, conveniently located, organized and modern. On-site lab. Cookies or banana bread with coffee and infused water for people waiting. I disliked how hard it was to consistently take my blood - multiple people fumbled this.Frequently caused pain that would last the rest of the day and into the next for the next draw. Only 2 people could consistently successfully find my veins. The 4th floor had an inexplicable air freshener that was so strong, it filled the elevators. It stung my eyes the first time I visited. The billing ""cashier"" is off putting and has a very disinterested and bored attitude, and is in the same room as the rest of the people waiting their turn to make their dreams come true. They need to change that. The wake up after egg retrieval was so harsh - the chair kept falling backwards and I was jolted awake from the anesthetic. Not cozy or warm and the person dealing with me seemed to hate her job and made me sign something when barely cognizant. No doctor or nurse to talk to you afterwards to help you feel any dignity. I left with blood on my hand left from the anesthesiologist and just feeling incised. Instead of heading home to relax and recuperate, I asked for a meeting with the client care coordinator and submitted my complaints. The good is that they do care about their client experience and want to grow and expand. So they seemed interested in how they could do better. Strengths. - they will work with women in their 40s using their own eggs, they have a smooth system during Registration and Monitoring, nice office, great refreshments, the staff working in egg retrieval are very supportive during egg retrieval.
Weakness- Billing is always done before a procedure giving you the feeling like they think you’re going to run off without paying, they prefer cash rather billing your insurance. It’s a business but they’re too money hungry.They can get you in and out quickly for routine monitoring. easy check in system and billing. clean and beautiful spacious office. The nurses are all kind and will try to give you any suggestions they can to help with your success. Dr are not always available but you can wait to see them or ask a question just need to be patient.Strengths: 
- Throughout our journey, the nurses were great at answering all our questions, and were accessible via their email portal.  The staff we met were patient and understanding, especially during the multiple appointments for bloodwork/sono, and doctor check-ins.  
- Very clean, open, bright facility

Weaknesses:
- On very busy days for bloodwork/sono, wait times can be extended.  We always tried to get their very early 7:30am/8:00am to avoid long wait times.I would go between 8-9am on the day that they would tell me to come in.  I would check in, and then wait for blood work and monitoring. Some days would take longer than others, but it really just depended on the day and the amount of people that were there. It was a very easy and straightforward process.New Hope has very experienced, smart doctors and their mini-IVF protocol, which I believe they pioneered there, is a great fit for our needs. It can sometimes feel like a bit of an infertility factory (ie impersonal, crowded waiting room, conveyor belt feeling when you go in for monitoring). That said, they are a well oiled machine and pretty much everyone there has been friendly with us, and occasionally gone above and beyond to bring the human touch to our experience. We are generally pleased so far with our experience there.The strengths are definitely the gentle treatment option and the efficiency of the practice operations.  The only weakness I would say is that any of the doctors can provide input on your protocol and the treatment could be inconsistent.  You can request to have consistency and limit your response to a couple doctors which has made a huge difference for us.The lobby is nice, and they seem to be well organized on the surface. But they are flashy with no substance. The nursing staff is disorganized, with too many cooks in the kitchen. You have to just know what to do. You wait for your name to flash on the screen to get bloodwork done (it says your chair number). Then you go back to the waiting room to wait for your name & the ultrasound room. To go to the ultrasound room, you walk through the bloodwork area and through a bunch of nurses, who say nothing to you. They do your ultrasound and just leave. Very impersonal, you're just a number. Strengths: Mini ivf for anyone looking for less invasive IVF
Weaknesses: Majority of staff is Chinese here, so it is very tough to understand what they are saying including Dr Zhang. No communications about treatment plan/ changes in protocol. Billing is very slow as well. They would keep sending me bills instead of getting it from insurance and would never respond to my emails. Almost feels like a mill..too many people and no personalized approachThis clinic is open seven days a week for monitoring, which is great. Unfortunately they only do egg retrievals before about 11:30 so that means doing a natural retrieval is impossible and you have to use a trigger. I think this is common for most clinics. At least they are open seven days a week. Many clinics close on Saturdays and/or Sundays. As I mentioned, they allow you to do retrievals without sedation if you want, which also saves you $500 and in my opinion is healthier for your brain. They have an in house lab for the standard monitoring bloodwork. They get good prices on outside lab work. Monitoring is much cheaper there than at other clinics I have researched. I don't like the smell they pump in to the clinic. We call it the New Hope smell and our clothes/coats/hair reek of it after being there. We are both very smell sensitive so we wish they would not use any fragrances in the clinic. I have not done any cycles at other clinics so I do not know what the differences are in how much individual attention you get. They see a lot of people. Unlike other clinics that have limited monitoring hours, New Hope offers monitoring from 7am - 2pm, which is great. I have definitely felt like a number there, but sometimes that's fine. Sometimes I just want to get in & out as fast as possible. The best days I was done in 20 min. The worst I wasn't properly input into the system and waited over an hour just to get the blood draw. Many of the doctors are not native English speakers and some have challenging accents. I appreciate that this clinic is independent and values new research. The clinic is the most comfortable atmosphere I've ever been in. As soon as you walk in you smell relaxing scented oils and hear beautiful meditation music playing in the background. It's very bright and spacious. Plenty of comfortable seats and a large beautifully lit fish tank that you can gaze upon. They have big tv screens where your first name and last initial pop up so that you know it's your turn to go in for either blood work or sonogram. The front desk staff is always helpful and pleasant . They offer wonderful refreshments such as coffee tea and cucumber lemon water as well as healthy snacks such as fruit and oatmeal cookies while you wait. It's such a relaxing place.Strength: they don’t give up on you and don’t tell you to go for donor egg. They have an amazing lab. 
Weakness: they too won’t change protocol and they treat you like a number. AWFUL nursing staff. No contact with anyone when you have questions. No one is accessible. The clinic have these big boards to tell each patient, were they need to go, for US, or blood work, every one is so organized, and empathetic, and makes you feel home, and they ban any one to talk over the phone, which is great, as there is a dedicated area where you can use your cell phone, and a small as it may seem, they make sure, always, coffee and crackers, are available, and well taken care of, basically you never feel that you are not attended to strengths  - his protocol is more rogue than most. Non-traditional and the costs are less. The phlebotomists are good.

weaknesses - You end up paying just as much, if not more, than you would at a traditional facility. The staff is not great, some of the nurses are inexperienced & do not know how to administer an ultrasound, et al.,NHF's strength is their efficiency, you are not waiting for blood work-ultrasound more than 30mins ever, results from that days monitoring is emailed, with all vital information and instructions within 2 hrs of leaving the clinic.  The cost for mini-ivf is great if you have the time to go slow, (ie younger patients).  
The weakness is the lack of contact with any direct person, you are talking to various nurses, doctors, and admin-financial staff.  At one point my payment was put on someone else's account, although I had just handed them my credit card with my name on it.  I also had to fight to get balances removed for treatment that was not performed.  I had by chance caught the mistake because I asked for a ledger with all treatment that I was charged for because the bill for the 2nd cycle was more than the 1st, even though I did the exact protocol.  

The clinic itself is pleasant enough except the waiting area has a very strong perfume/air freshener that was hard to tolerate. Strength: everything is on site. Weaknesses: One size fits all treatment model, lack of transparency, genetic screening is not thorough, there is no personal attention, treatment is dragged out over many many weeks unnecessarily.Strenth: everything is done in house so blood results and sonos are quick. They have really flexible hours for monitoring, between 7am-2pm, which is amazing compared to many other clinics.  The retrievals/transfers are also done in the same facility so you dont have to pay an extra hospital fee of $1005 like over at Cornell and NYP. 

Hated the billing department!  Took them 4 months to correct an insurance payment and apply the credit to my account. Strengths-their bread and butter is women over 40 and difficult cases. It has excellent flexible monitoring times 7 am-2 pm-perfect for the working woman! Large welcoming space. 

Weaknesses-they are getting quite big and heavy traffic. Maybe add more doctors..Maybe also facilitate a way for existing patients to have a forum to meet up and discuss (through their own volition) their issues to know they are not aloneThey overbook so expect to wait a very very long time for iui procedures and other procedures.  I can’t think of any strengths I was very unhappy at this clinic.  They do have a  communication portal but it was always someone new that I was talking with which felt very odd and impersonal.  After 2 failed iui’s the random doctor who was there that day just asked if I wanted to skip the 3rd iui and just move onto IVF and I was like, yeah actually I do but I am 100% not doing IVF here.  It seemed so weird how casually it was mentioned.  Pretty traumatizing for a newbie.  Now that I’m an IVF veteran I have no problem with a doctor speaking so bluntly but it wasn’t even my doctor!! And he was making that decision for me.New Hope is a clean, well run office. The Mini IVF approach works for those that want a low stimulation that mirrors most natural cycle. Communication is what this office lacks as there were a few disconnects in our journey. Most of the challenges were in the implant stage vs retrieval. They are conveniently located and take many forms of insurance. They may work effectively with younger women, but do not seem to have any particular strength working with women who need more customized protocols. Scheduling time with Dr Zhang is hit and miss. Sometimes you get to see him soon, other times it is a long wait of up to 2.5 hours.

The clinic is new and clean.  Utrasound and bloodwork is efficient and the wait time is short.

The problem is on egg retrieval day. It was the most horrific experience of my life. The assistant checking me in told me not to be scared about what I see in the waiting room. When I entered the waiting room, I saw the same room doubled as recovery and waiting rooms. There were no beds. A patient was sleeping on a sofa, recovering from her retrieval. Another woman was left to walk out of the room on her own with no help. She did not have anesthesia. Another woman was in so much pain, she had to be wheeled out in a rolling bed. It was so busy that I had to wait in the recovery area as patients came out of their retrieval. I saw patients coming out like this one after another and I can see every one was not feeling well. There was no privacy. I could see and hear the nurse telling every one about their retrieval results. I had to wait two hours for my turn. I was very upset and scared, sitting there watching all of this happening. I was just told to take everything off from the waist down. In two other IVF clinics I attended, you took all your clothes off under the gown. Here, they just wanted you to drop your pants for a quick retrieval. It was a rushed factory. No anesthesiologist checked on me to ask about allergies or medical conditions. When it was my turn, they were running far behind schedule and they acted very rushed. It did not sound like they were going to be careful. Dr Zhang was not the attending physician. It was someone else. Dr Zhang never told me that it would be another doctor. I never saw Dr Zhang. This was a shock to me. I had never met this other doctor before, and he never introduced himself to me. He just asked me how many follicles I had and if I had IVF before. That was all. He never bothered to read my patient history. He started working on me before the anesthesia took effect. I had to tell them to wait. They never put any blood pressure cuff on me. The room was dark. The operating room in two other IVF clinics I attended were brightly lit. How can they see in the dark? There were no nurses in the operating room. In other IVF clinics I attended, there was a whole team of people helping with egg retrieval. This made me worried about my treatment. Everything felt careless and dangerous.

When I woke up, the nurse told me they could only retrieve 4 eggs. She also told me 2 of those 4 eggs were broken. I was devastated to hear this. No doctor came to talk to me. No one else told me what happened. I was told that I can go. They never checked if there was someone to drive me home. They never gave me any water or food. That was a horrific experience. It was traumatic to hear that they broke my eggs and then they just asked me to leave. Afterwards, I could not find any information anywhere about how eggs can be broken. I emailed the nurse to ask. She told me that this can happen when they use high pressure to aspirate the eggs. I contacted other clinics to find out if this can happen and they told me that they have never heard of eggs breaking. I scheduled an appointment to see Dr. Zhang. He explained that it might be the fault of the doctor or maybe they retrieved my eggs at the wrong time.
After the anesthesia, I felt nausea and dizziness. I never felt like this when I recovered from other procedures under anesthesia. I also had pain and inflammation for 1 week after the procedure. I never felt this bad with the other two retrievals I had in other clinics. It felt like they were not careful with the anesthesia and they were so rough during retrieval that there was probably scarring and that was how my eggs were broken. Since I don't have many eggs, every egg counts. I was devastated to hear that they broke 2 of my eggs. That IVF cycle was not a success. I will always wonder if those 2 eggs were not broken because of New Hope's carelessness, I would have had a successful procedure. I would not recommend anyone to go here. If this happened to you, you will always be left wondering if your broken eggs was a lost opportunity. Strengths: affordability, convenience (for those in NYC area) 
Weaknesses: lack of communication, lack of physician contact, physicians did not seem to care about me as a person (e.g., physician who did retrieval)Good location, easy monitoring, lighter protocol -- which i think is still effective. I liked many of the nurses, embryologists. Sometimes, nurses don't get back to you, or seem to be not be very knowledgeable or experienced -- that is troublesome, as it adds to stress. Strength: is the variety of options for different people. It's not a one size fits all solution.  The fact everything you need for the procedure is ON SITE is really a profound difference from other clinics I visited. Everyone understood what needed to be done and while it wasn't perfect, there was a structure and if you can deal with that then you'll be fine. 

Weakness: poor financial coordination and communication that end. It was always hard to understand what I needed or if a payment wasn't made or when it wasn't made - what to do to help it go faster once paid. I got a feeling the ladies in the department were overwhelmed. New Hope is a large clinic with a ton of patients and many doctors, and a very strong embryology department, which is really the most important thing. They were committed to my care despite my age (43) and didn't discriminate to protect their stats. They are very good at what they do, but there is very little hand-holding or bedside manner. You have to be proactive as a patient and do your research and ask lots of questions. I saw many different doctors and nurses, which was fine because they were all good, but it very much felt like I was on an IVF conveyor belt. An wonderful, effective conveyor belt, because I did end up pregnant at 44 and now have an amazing baby!The clinic is very busy but does monitoring and retrievals every morning seven days a week. They are very economically priced compared to most clinics in America. I like it that you can choose to do egg retrievals without sedation. Most clinics will not allow the patient this choice.New Hope is very flexible with protocol and listening to what you want. i have on numerous occasion requested less of a dosage, questioned  when they were triggering and even changed freezing embryos into an IUI which resulted in my first son's conception. They are open to suggestions which is a big plus. The clinic had a comfortable, relaxing setting. It felt like a spa. The embryologist were amazing and I loved Dr. Zhang's positivity. It made my treatments feel less stressful. However, the billing department was an absolute nightmare. I have never seen such incompetence in any clinical setting in my life. I left the clinic solely because of the billing department.It's a very organized, top notch, modern, Has latest technology (I watched on giant flat screen tv when they took egg out of me and again when they put it back in). Truly amazing. I trust these guys.Very efficient monitoring system. Never waited longer than 1/2 hour for monitoring. Great monitoring hours (7am to 1pm).  Not all patients opt for general anesthesia (most do local).  I did general and the anesthesiologist that they hire from an outside agency was late which caused my retrieval to be delayed by 45 minutes and caused me a lot of anxiety. The worst finance department I’ve ever encountered. Very unorganized and unprofessional. Also the lab messed up our charts. It was a terrible experience and I’d never recommend New Hope to anyone. I was so distraught after this experience that I had to take a break from trying to get pregnant Results are efficient and accurate. Their forms and systems are very clear and easy to follow. As a new patient always ask questions to any staff and they will kindly help out. At time is very hectic due to the hours and you might feel rushed specially when having sonogram, but they’ll explain all they’re doing so you can leave satisfied.The clinic is very large- lots of available times and you would never need to wait longer then 10-15 minutes.  
I really don't have any weaknesses other than they were not able to retrieve a healthy embryo as of yet :( Very clean and visually appealing facility. They always had coffee, tea and fresh fruits and snacks in the waiting area. Not once did I feel uncomfortable or disrespected. There was never a prolonged wait time. I was generally in and out which was great for me since I went before work. I never felt rushed or judged. The strength of New Hope is that it is very clean.  The weaknesses outway the strengths.  It was unorganized, stressful to deal with staff, horrible communication, and the people were not trustworthy. 
There would be 40 others in the waiting room. The wait was usually 90 minutes +The biggest strength I believe is their very reasonable pricing. Also, they have a strong belief in natural/low stim IVF cycles especially with older women as they believe it helps with egg quality. The weakness for me was the factory like feeling there.Good condition, toilets are sometimes dirty, hygiene ......
Accounts are difficult to communicate with... laboratory is quick but they don’t process blood work after 2 pm in case of emergency. Bad communication between NHFC and genetic test labsExcellent wait time. Even at it's most busiest hour, you are in and out in a timely manner.   Clinic is extremely clean.   Entire staff is beyond warm and friends.  Everybody has a smile on their face.   No weaknesses. Very centrally located. Easy to find, friendly staff. Compassionate care, the cost of treatment is competitive and producing the best results. The doctor and staff walk you to the entire process and helps you choose the best course of treatmentThey do not sugar coat things, they say exactly what and why and how things are happening. They communicate mostly through email. Their are a few different departments but you mostly deal with the nursing department and the prescription department. You can feel assured that the Dr.'s at this clinic all know the latest techniques and strategies for protocol for each person's needs. There's a chance you'll feel a bit like you are on an assembly line at first. I can't stress enough - make your voice heard! Ask questions, and if someone doesn't know the answer, make a consult appt. with your chosen Dr. there. In my case, I chose Dr. Merhi - hands down. Sometimes - the billing dept. can be a bit cold and treat you like a number. I recommend taking care of billing stuff before the day of a major procedure (IUI, egg retrieval, IVF transfer, hysteroscopy, etc.). It can be a bit unnerving to deal with billing dept. the day of those emotional procedures. If your name comes up to visit billing - hopefully it's not on a major procedure day. If you know you need to pay for something and a major procedure is coming, just be proactive about taking care of it early. They WILL call you in on a procedure day and make you pay before the retrieval/transfer. Feels a bit cold, I must say. But - it's not free after all. Just recommending you take care of it before the DAY OF. It really helps if you read their website re: all the different levels of IVF, etc., and then make your list of questions going in for the very first consultation with a Dr. of your choice. If you need to, meet with 3 or 4 different Dr.'s in the beginning to see who you gel with.Strengths: 
- More friendly pricing (we found it cheaper than other clinics)
- Flexible monitoring windows that can accommodate different schedules
- Convenient location at Columbus Circle, emailing instructions (instead of calling -- really awkward to take those calls in public!).

Weaknesses:
- You won't see your doctor each time you come in to monitor (unless you wait after monitoring) as you are monitored by the nurses
- No one explains what to expect for normal procedures prior to that day (ie I wanted to know exactly what to expect on egg retrieval day or transfer day) so if you're interested in knowing beforehand, make sure you schedule a consultation to ask a staff member directly what to expect.
- Sometimes we would be waiting for a consultation with the doctor, and the doctor's nurse support staff (not the monitoring nurses) would try to field our questions instead of letting us see the doctor directly... when this happened, we often felt really dissatisfied with the nurses' answers -- and often they were not consistent with the doctor's answers! Again, my advice is to always advocate for yourself, and insist on seeing the doctor even if the nurses are trying to get you out the door. If you advocate for yourself, then I believe you will have a good experience. 

Notes:
The clinic is, as are many of the doctors, busy busy busy. You can be a human, or you can be just a number. I think that part of it really depends on how you advocate for yourself. New Hope was very different for us versus the previous clinic we worked with.  It is very fast paced, technologically advanced, and reminds me of the military in the respect that they have everything down to a science. Most communication occurs via email.  Additionally, New Hope was fairly priced and more reasonable than other clinics (which we GREATLY appreciated) and offered more advanced care.  It can feel slightly cold or isolating, however, we didn't mind as we weren't there for the experience.  We were there for results.  And that is what we got!Monitoring hours are 7am-1 or 2pm. Was in and out every time I went in. You get the blood work done, go back into the waiting area and are called in for sono moments laterThis clinic runs like a well oiled machine. It is organized, sparkling clean, and incredible accessible to patients. The downside is that sometimes it is so busy it can be overwhelming. I would tell new patients not to be intimidated but the wait screen or sheer volume of patients. Expect waits that are not terribly long, but be prepared to make exceptions sometimes. If you go early in the morning you can turn around within 30-45 min.NHFC, is a good clinic, in some clinics the success rate is based on multiple attempts. ​The clinic has great facility​ and skilled staff.  The place is clean, they provide snacks for you while you wait! I highly recommend this place if your having issues getting pregnant! It's not a easy process but the reward at the end is well worth the fight! Thank you Dr MerhiWith the exception of Dr. Olcha, the clinic tends to treat you more like a # as opposed to a person. The clinic is sometimes organized when it comes to monitoring appointments. Dr. Olcha brings a human side to the clinic as opposed to a factory setting. My overall experience was great and I do not really have any complaints.  From the setting to the ambiance to the service to the state of the art equipment, I was really impressed and pleased. I would not change anything about the clinic. I do not see any weaknesses as of today.Great - spacious, accommodating, great hours. Trust the process. Don't worry about seeing a doctor each time - it will take them away from what they are really good at, which is studying the data to determine the best course of action for your cycle. It is very nice and welcoming clinic. It is so clean and set to have patients feel relaxed and comfortable. I like that they have easy to reach location with a nice view. They are in a very quiet and nice neighborhood Use new Hope fertility clinic their approach and their protocol I feel it makes      alot more sense as far as the alternative choices that you have.  I’m very pleased with my options.  They have very updated resources than conventional Very organize. Will not change nothing. Continue doing what you do every day to make miracle happen. Taking blood and doing sonogram is super fast. Their system really works and has helped me achieved my 2nd pregnancy Well oiled machine. Sign in, Screen Monitoring, and name appears on the list.I loved going in for monitoring!  It the highlight of my weeks!  The lobby/waiting area is so lovely and spacious.  Tons of seating and really open and bright with lots of windows.  I visited other locations with waiting areas that are dark and depressing with women waiting packed together in a room - that does not work for me!  After checking in with the receptionist (who were all so friendly), I'd sit and wait for a few minutes before being called in for bloodwork.  I don't love getting my blood taken but everyone at New Hope was so gentle and I survived every time and it barely hurt and they made me feel at ease.  Then when I would get called in for the ultrasound, it was so fun and informative to see everything on the screen and how my follicles were progressing.  Dr. Olcha works so hard everyday so every morning that I would go in for monitoring, he would be there!  It was nice to have him in all of my scans!  Chelsea, the physician's assistant who works with Dr. Olcha, is also a star.  She is so lovely and I am so thankful she was there doing most of my scans for me.   All the nurses and staff were super nice and very friendly. They always remembered me and made feel comfortable. Thank you! I will miss seeing you. The monitoring happens at every visit or appointment. Your name will come up next to its own monitoring room number on the television, so pay attention!super well oiled machine. Window is 7am thru 1pm....7-9am if you want to speak to a doctor. I would get in 7:45 and be our by 8:30-8:45 in time to get to work. Super easyMonitoring was the best part of this experience. Everyone is so nice and efficientMy monitoring experience is great. The ladies who gets my blood has no problem. Although I have small veins, they still manage to get it done. They always ask me if I’m doing ok. 

As for sonogram, I love the ladies there. So respectful. I get along well with them. They know how hard and how long and our loses. They’ve become my friends there. Always smiling. :) which I love. Makes my day. No complaints Generally, these guys are a well-oiled machine. Only once, after many monitoring experiences that went well, did they have an admin issue and make me wait even though I had been cleared by Finance! The nurses providing the sonograms are generally nice and competent. This was actually great. You had a large window and rarely a long wait time. The Dr did most of the sonograms, if she was there. She only came in 3 days a week. In 3 retrieval she never did ours Monitoring hours are very flexible here. Weekdays are 7am - 2pm, weekends are 7am - 12pm which was huge selling point for me. Scans are done by techs and not MDs. Some of were much better than others but nearly all were quite competent. The 3rd floor monitoring experience was nice. There was a screen for the 4th floor appointments with people's names coming up that were not in the room. Not sure why that was there. There was coffee, tea, water and snack. It was quiet and intimate and not as perfumed as the 4th floor. The upstairs monitoring is sometimes standing room only and a well oiled machine. But still can mean a wait for over an hour some days. Well oiled machinemonitoring was the easiest and best part. no stress in and out within 30 mins and they really watched out for you if it was taking more than 15 minutes they were back there moving things along. it was the results and protocol that took til the end of the day or next day to get the info.- Best to go in early (7:30am/8:00am) to avoid extended wait times during busy morning cycle.
- Nurses and tech staff for blood/sono were great; I was always seen by a doctor afterwardsGenerally, monitoring is smooth and runs like a well oiled machine. Occasionally, it will take a bit longer on busy mornings. I have noticed a range of thoroughness among the ultrasound technicians. Several times the people didn’t seem to look very carefully or thoroughly for follicles, but others are more methodical. The office is open 7 days a week including holidays and the monitor lists your name after you check in to see where you should go.  We have a condition which requires the phlebotomist be very sensitive and they definitely comply with that.  The sonograms techs are always up front with results and will sometimes bring in a team leader if more information is needed.It felt like an upscale DMV. You checked in, and waited to see your name come up on a TV screen in the lobby that sent you to bloodwork or the ultrasound room. They have monitoring hours from only 7am-3pm. You cannot book an appointment and sometimes the wait time was almost an hour to get blood work and sonogram. They don't handle special requests such as if you have to leave early, etc. For instance, one day I needed to get out by a certain time to catch the train and they were like-""we can't do anything about it, you have to wait""Monitoring is very efficient. You go when you can get there and the wait is usually not that long.It's fairly well-oiled machine. Some days were better than others. Some times of day are better than others too. Monitoring is set up in the most efficient and caring way. You check in and then look for your name to pop up on the screen signaling it's your turn. Nurses nd staff are always friendly and efficient and they get to know you personally. I loved how efficient and easy monitoring is. They were very convenient and easy to know My monitoring was pretty simple. I did appreciate the large window of time that was allotted and I was able to usually be in/out within 45 mins.Monitoring was very efficient and the window of time to go in was very reasonable. Relatively fast and simple.The clinic had monitors on the walls that called your name up when it was your turn to get blood drawn or to go inside the the sonogram. I appreciated this aspect of their monitoring system, instead of relying on someone calling out my name. I was able to go to the appropriate station as I saw my name come upmonitoring appointments themselves were easy but the communication disconnect came into play when determining my lining was Ok to move forward with implant. It was very quick and efficient, but there was no interaction with doctors. Monitoring was no problem. It was efficient and the wait time was short.they have very wide monitoring window, so it is very convenient.Very efficient, but also very impersonal.I like the monitoring here. It is very efficient and you come when you want to (mornings and maybe afternoons?)A bit of a cattle call - busy at early morning (pre-work) hours and lunchtimeAn efficient well oiled machine. Your first name appears on tv monitors in the large waiting room letting you know when to go back for bloodwork, ultrasound, or billing dept. Cattle callMonitoring was from 7am-1pm which was very convenient. I would go right before work and make it in time. Results of blood tests were given within 4-5 hours and clear instructions were always provided.  Monitoring hours are very convenient! It is a well-oiled machine. Hours are 7am-12noon. The sooner you arrive, the less time you'll wait. The longest I've waited was about 30 minutes. That was only because I went in closer to 11-12pm time. They are a well-oiled machine. Once you arrive and check-in, you're in line in the order you came.It's a pretty efficient monitoring system. Most of the time I was able to be in and out (bloodwork and sonogram) within 20-40 minutes. 

Once in a while, the wait was so long and I had to check in with the front desk again to make sure they didn't forget about me. Make sure to not be afraid to check in again if you feel that you've been waiting longer than 30 minutes for bloodwork. Monitoring hours were a little tricky for me because I had to be at work by 8:00 am as a teacher. However, if I arrived around 6:45 I was never late to work and ready to leave the clinic by 7:40.Monitoring at nh was good. If you come in early, you are in and out. No CommentEverybody would wait in line based on clinic arrival time. It was very convenient and their schedule works very well with working patients",6.899999999999998,6.899999999999998,"convenient location, flexible monitoring time, staff are friendly. It was totally unpredictable whether you'd wait for 10 minutes or 30.Clinic is very clean. At the time of treatment Dr. Luk was actually working at a different clinic. Doctors who performs the transfers are friendly and I can ask anything even though he is busy doing what he needs to do. Very nice and professional
 Made me feel very comfortable every time I had an appointment You sign in on a computer when you arrive-   very pleasant room with nice music lots of light snacks  etc     always was seen fairly quickly less than 20 mins typically The clinic was very clean and had state of the art equipment and procedures were run with the utmost professional staff. Some of the sonogram technicians (NOT nurses) liked to pretend they really new a lot about medical needs/advice - which was not great for a ""newbie"" like me in the beginning of my journey. I don’t have anything negative to say about this facility.... and I’ve recommended New Hope to many people and I will continue to do so!We are grateful to New Hope because it is the one clinic where we got a a healthy Embryo and did a successful transfer. The front desk staff is always helpful and pleasant . ,NHF's strength is their efficiency, you are not waiting for blood work-ultrasound more than 30mins ever, results from that days monitoring is emailed, with all vital information and instructions within 2 hrs of leaving the clinic. They do have a  communication portal but it was always someone new that I was talking with which felt very odd and impersonal. I could see and hear the nurse telling every one about their retrieval results. She also told me 2 of those 4 eggs were broken. - Nurses and tech staff for blood/sono were great; I was always seen by a doctor afterwardsGenerally, monitoring is smooth and runs like a well oiled machine."
11,New Hope Fertility Center,protocol,"We did three cycles of Clomid, only two of which we completed with IUI. A fill-in doctor convinced my husband that the risk of multiples was too great during our first cycle so we didn't do IUI. However, given my age, the chance of pregnancy was so low he needn't have worried we'd end up with multiples. The second cycle the dose of Clomid was lowered and we didn't get pregnant. The third cycle, the dose of Clomid was returned to the original and we didn't get pregnant. However, Dr. Zhang forewarned me that the placement of my fibroids made pregnancy very unlikely.Dr. Zhang used Clomid with me for all of the cycles I was never told which specific agnostic or type. Just learning this myself via research. 
They wanted to do Natural IVF, But I reminded them that I wanted to do Mini IVF. 
I started with half of Isisbloom BCPs, Monitoring, Chlomid, Letrizol and then Trigger and retrieve. 
I have to do more rounds of retrieval.
I was prescribed a medicine for the follicles to grow. 20 eggs were retrieved. Among them, 18 were fertilized, and 11 reached the blastocyst stage. Others were abnormal so were discarded. I was prescribed some other medications to make sure the 2nd FET to be a successful. And one of them was stopped on the day of FET and others were continued till 10 weeks of pregnancy. For both cycles, my treatment was pretty similar.  Before my first cycle and before the second cycle, I took birth control to baseline everything.  Then once I started, it was a Follstim injection every night for the whole time with Clomid for the whole time as well and Letrozole for the first 5 nights.  Orillissa before I triggered, and then the retrievals!  It was really easy and pain-free - the injections did not hurt me at all even though I was so scared in the beginning!  I would go in for monitoring early in the morning and he would always have instructions for me on what protocol to do next right away and I never had to wait long.  The results were good both times - he seemed really happy with it - overall, 18 eggs retrieved and 17 frozen.   Many natural cycles (usually producing one eggs)
Few mini ivf cycles )usually producing one-three eggs)Dr. Olcha made sure I didn’t need too much IVF injections and was monitored on a daily basis. Once my eggs were at a good size; in one simple procedure he was able to retrieve 26 eggs! And 8 embryos were then then frozen. We also did genetics testing as we hoped our first born be a boy along with checking for diseases. The entire process was well communicated at all times. In my next cycle he performed our chosen embryo transfer. Everything went very well and I am now 9 weeks pregnant thanks to Dr. Olcha! First cycle: birth control pills for a week, 300 units of Gonal-F per shot until they later reduce, Clomid, Letrozole, and Cetrotide taken in separated parts.

Second cycle: the same, but the Gonal-F units were smaller.1st retrieval was a cyst so we grew the remaining follicles. He tweaked the Clomid dosage (from 100mg from prior doc to 50 mg)...not sure if since I was in lutheal phase. Next cycle he might do clomid + injectables (Im doing ""mini ivf"")He had me try a 14 day course of BC pills in an attempt to lower my FSH. The last BW I had done 2 months prior was 79. I had to stop after 11 days as I had gained 9 lbs. Coming back in after that my FSH was down to 10 and I don’t remember the last time it was that low. At the ultrasound they thought I had two cysts. I had a period. And came back in for more BW and ultrasound on CD 9 after taking estrace for 14 days and they said I was good to go and rushed me in for an egg retrieval 2 days later. Turns out as I suspected they were still the two cysts from before. So we got nothing. Mini ivf using clomid, letrozol, cetrotide and very small doses of follistim.We did an ultra mini IVF cycle which involved clomid and femara tabs only. I was able to produce 4 mature eggs which all got fertilized, however I ended up with one very good grade blastocyst.
We also did PGS testing for aneuploidy which came back aneuploid. I think I shouldn't have done PGS testing on my only blastocyst especially since I have never had a miscarriage.
I was able to get them to do a saline sonogram which showed i had a possible polyp and was then scheduled for hysteroscopy.Dr.Merhi began with a natural IUI cycle since I already ovulate on my own. I dont know why I dont get pregnant. After it failed he didnt call me or follow up. I called the clinic and told him I wanted to do IVF which his answer was ok no problem and just sent me to a coordinator to explain meds for IVF. I was on clomid 100mg and Gonal F for about 10 days. Again, didnt see him or hear from him. Retrieval was coordinated by nurses and another RE in the clinic was the one to do the procedure.Mini-IVF:  clomid, letrozol and follistim, followed by Ovidrel as a trigger shot. For the transfer, progesterone suppositories and estrogen pills.  I was preparing for retrieval’s of my own eggs (one or two he sees), he uses minimal meds. Trigger shots when it’s time for retrieval in two days , I don’t remember the meds I had taken. 

For preparing egg donor transfers, I have been taking estradiol, promethium....depends on my blood work result if it needs some adjusting I had taken prednisone, progesterone shot on my butt, baby aspirin, enoxaparin injection on my stomach. Sometimes my lining needs to be thicker so they up my use to progesterone sometimes. Dr Merhi is trying a more natural approach. I am currently on estradiol. He also had me take hgh for an 6 week period. Also he provide me with a free trial of ozone therapy for 8 weeks. I also had an ovarian rejuvenation done as well. After six month of not ovulating I finally ovulated two eggs but the second one was too small.  They received one egg and that a lot because the first time I had egg retrieval I had no eggs. But my embryo did not make it to blastocyst. I am now back for my second go at it and it has been 5 months since my last egg retrieval. Initially, I went in to freeze eggs. Dr. Merhi suggested I fertilize them as he instructed embryos had better survivability.  My status with my partner did not allow the confidence to move ahead so I froze eggs. I tried, several months later (after my relationship ended) two donor sperm IUIs (one with Dr. Davis-RMA and one with Merhi’s staff). IUI was unsuccessful and I wasn’t thrilled that the Merhi’s clinic kept me waiting, delayed in the reception area bc of some administrative error. I made a written comment but did not receive a reply. Now, I’ve moved on to create one embryo and one mosaic embryo. I am on the verge of meeting with my doc to talk about the viability of the mosaic. I am surprised I wasn’t told about mosaics in my first fertilization round / genetics testing, but Merhi says that it wasn’t available then. She never explained why did anything. First cycle started with pills, and didn’t have shots til the end. Resulted in 3 eggs. Next she started with pills and shots. Resulted in 13 eggs. Next round she did pills and 1/2 the amount of shots. Results 8 eggs. Never discussed why the change. Finally after the third round I asked her why she thought we were getting numerous eggs but no normal ones. Her response was she basically didn’t know. It felt like she just hadn’t thought about it. Mini IVF (clomid, letrozole, 150 follistim)
Conv IVF (clomid, letrozole, 225 follistim)We did mini ivf both times. The second time around we used more GonalF per dose, so that we could get more follicles and more chances for successful embryos. The first 2 that made it to blastocysts were complex abnormal and not recommended for transfer. Low dose birth control pills (1/2 a pill for 14 days) 5 - 7 days of Clomid 50mg 1/2 a pill, lupron trigger shot then egg retrieval for MINI IVF. THIS PROTOCAL WILL ONLY YIELD 1 or 2 eggs for retrieval however as a more natural cycle it will yield quality over quantity He was a strong believer in less is more which I get and agree with. But I had a specific issue of thin lining that did not respond well to the estrace they were giving me and we did cycle after cycle where I had to cancel because of poor lining. when I told them I had met people who had great success with using the patch they were not receptive to that so after years of trying with them Left and that was good because now my lining is perfect and I just need to get the right eggs. - adjusted pills/hormones based on cycle prior to egg retrieval
- hormones/pills in preparation for egg transfer
- hormones/pills after transfer (successful transfer and pregnancy prior to being released to regular OB)My first cycle and my current cycle have both been with a mini-IVF (low dose) protocol. This cycle, in response to issues from the last, Dr. Lipkin made several changes including lowering the dose of the injection and (planning to) leave a full 36 hours between trigger and retrieval instead of the 34 hours that was done last time. DR. Zhang's mini IVF strategy uses less medication, more regular monitoring and a less invasive procedure.  This procedures were done to adjust to our egg reserve and quality which have resulted in positive retrievals however no quality fertilization.He wanted to do mini-IVF, as I have low ovarian reserve. First cycle, birth control pills, then half a clomid for 7 days. Second (cancelled) cycle, birth control pills and 1/4 clomid for 7 days. He said that my previous clinic had been ""overfeeding"" my eggs, and he'd had much success with this method. No results produced whatsoever. I was given Follistim for about 10 days before egg retrieval. Post embryo transfer, I was taking Progesterone in oil shots to help the embryo implant and increase progesterone in blood. My endometrium lining is also on the thinner side, so I was taking estrogen supplements every dayI mostly did natural cycles with mini or ultra mini ivf a couple times. This is because I am at an age where I don't have many eggs to conventional just would not do anything beneficial for me and would have some negatives. We have two five day blasts frozen. We did not pgs test them so we do not know if they are aneuploidy. We were told that at my age, the likelihood is that they will not have normal chromosomes. The clinic let us decide whether to test them and did not pressure us either way. We are trying to collect and freeze several five day blastocysts while we can and implant later.He used birth control pills to prep cycles. He, like the other doctors at New Hope, is comfortable with low or no dose protocols. I also used clomid at the beginning of cycle a few times. I've never made more than 6 eggs tops, but that's fine there. They aim for quality over quantity, which fits my body better than traditional treatments. Dr. LIU prescribes 1/2 dose of bcp's prior to starting a cycle for 10 day only as to not over supress my ovaries.
I was also put on Clomid and Letrozole to stimulate multiple follicle development which I responded to nicely.
I used a mini ivf protocol with minimal gondateopin injections ( gonal f) 75-150 for about 10-12 day.
Cetrotide was used the last 3 days of stimulation in order to prevent ovulation. 
Lupron 20 mg was used as a trigger shot along with 1/2 dose of Ganirelex. 
This cycle resulted in 7 eggs retrieved
5 fertilized 2 made it to Blast.Dr Zhang originally said it would be mini ivf. But it wound up being ultra mini ivf with clomid only (one cycle he used letrozole).... each cycle I only produced one follicle. And I pay out of pocket. I asked if we could stimulate me more, given I’m Paying for a retrieval for one egg, but he kept saying no Dr.Merhi, used the minimal stimulation technique, and that was one of the very big pitfalls, other fertility doctor stick to, and even when the 1st cycle, did not work, Dr.Merhi, added the steroid and aspirinI do not remember the name of the protocol that he put me on. The first round was more aggressive than the other ones; but I used the following medications

Birth Control pills - - which I told him that I was nervous about, due to the fact that they can make fibroids grow...he (or the nurses) would tell me they weren't anything to worry about
Clomid 
Ganirellex 
Follistim Because I had had several cysts with my first doctor, I sought NHF because of there mini-IVF protocols for patients with PCOS.  I did 3 late luteal phase mini-ivf cycles using letrozole, clomid, and gonal-f, with lupron after the first retrieval to allow for a second retrieval in one cycle.  The rationale was that we could stimulate the lagging follicles to get more eggs per cycle.  I was able to get two embryos during the first 2 cycles, they were sent out for PGS testing and came back abnormal and per the labs protocols, they were discarded.Two months on BC pills with weekly monitoring (waste of time and money). Clomid and Femara. Lupron injection.Mild IVF - started with estrace priming, then clomid, letrozole pills, and follistim injections starting at 75iu. Continued with a mix of clomid and letrozole pills, and varying dosages of follistim(from 75-150iu) up until lupron trigger and then retrievalmini ivf, luteal phase, as this is what my body reacts to better. I have had several rounds of mini IVF and egg freezing..20 eggs fertlized with donor sperm, made 7 embryos, of which 4 were mosaic, and 1 embryo which remains untested. He recommended mini IVF for me due to high FSH.  They never even tested my AMH which was so weird, but I did 2 out cycles with him and he did clomid ok both.  I saw a technician for follicle scans and they couldn’t talk to you and a different doctor for both iui procedures.  One nurse helped me with a trigger before the procedure because I became overwhelmed by the fact that they told me to do it but no one ever showed me how and I was standing in the office and actually started to cry because it was like being 100% alone yet surrounded by medical professional. . Mini IVF that included estradiol pills daily and follistim injections. Ovidrel was  used to stimulate the final follicle(s) maturation and to initiate the trigger before Egg Retrieval.There was consistent blood work done at their facilities.  New Hope recommends a ""natural"" IVF approach that is low dosage and involves fewer injectables. They claim that this is equally/more successful than traditional approaches, but they do not take into account age or diagnosis in personalizing a protocol. I produced very few eggs, and none matured far enough for transfer. He prescribed minimal stimulation IVF. I started on birth control pills: two pills a day for 2 days, then 1 pill a day for 3 days, then half a pill a day for 3 days. Seven days later, I started clomid: 50 mg/day for 5 days then 25  mg/day for 4 days. At the same time I started clomid, I took letrazole 2.5 mg/day for 6 days. One day after starting clomid and letrazole, I started follistim: 75 IU/day for 7 days. One the last day of follistim, I injected half a syringe of ganirelix. The trigger was 10 IU lupron and 150 IU ovidrel.

The rational for the procedure was not explained, other than to say that this is the minimal stimulation protocol. Birth control pills (Desogen, Apri, Reclipsen): HALF a tablet by mouth daily for about a week before the cycle began
Letrozole 2.5mg tablet, 1 tablet. Clomid 50mg, 1 tablet. Both for 5 days. Follistim 150 units for four days
At this point I discontinued the Letrozole and continued Clomid and Follistim for ~3 days
nasal spray and Ovidrel the night before the retrievalHe uses minimal stimulation estrase/chlomid/femara/fsh/ganorelixI can't remember the dosage, but I took Clomid and did a trigger shot and that was it. What I loved is he followed my natural cycle and we didn't force anything. We would take my blood about 10 times a month to follow my cycle and after the first time, we learned what it was fairly easy. By the 4th retrieval, it was easy. The goal was to do multiple retrievals instead of one big one with lots of eggs and stay with my natural cycle.  I could have probably done a few more, but I stopped at 4 due to cost. 

The Clomid made it so I had some extra unfertilized eggs under my natural cycle, as my blood tests came back and I got closer to the ovulation date he would set a date and I'd do a trigger shot the night before and go in for retrieval at a specific time the next day.  

I got 3 unfertilized eggs each treatment, for a total of 12, only 3 of the twelve made it to DAY 5 and then we had genetic testing and of the 3, ONE was good. And we now have a really beautiful, super healthy boy. Mini-IVF. Considered more effective in women my age (43 at the time of treatment).We've done natural and mini ivfs at the clinic. I really can't remember specifically which times we did what. I don't have many follicles but we do have a couple of frozen blasts after this that we did not choose to pgs test because of finances and other reasons.Since I have low amh levels dr zhang didn’t force a lot of stims. We did a lot of natural cycles. This is one clinic who is okay with taking out only one egg at a time. Mini IVF with FET for first transfer, and FET for second transfer. Both were SETs.We did natural cycle IVF - no hormones, just the nasal spray trigger shot and a shot upon egg transfer. Rest was blood work and scans. Didn't use anesthesia for egg retrieval or live egg transfer. We did it all in same cycle, worked first time.Mini ivf - 150 gonal F, 50 clomid, 2.5 letrazole. Goal was quality over quantity. It was ridiculous! We did an IUI without an medication and then one with. We paid out of pocket. She wanted us to fail so we would move on to IVF. They never diagnosed us with anything. First we tried several cycles just being monitored for ovulation. Then we were suggested to take Clomid and letrozol 2.5 and we got pregnant with triplets!She wanted to go about with a mini IVF cycle- she told me that she preferred to get less eggs upon retrieval but with a better chance to get healthier eggs. I originally wanted to go with natural cycle IVF, but went with his recommendation to use the fertility medication because of my age. We did Mini IVF protocols for both my wife and myself.  We then did Reciprocal IVF.He recommended a mini IVF because of my age (39) with PGD testing and then eSET. I’ve done mini Ivf and natural ivf. The procedures were good. However there were a lack of proper data analysis to customize and alter treatment I did the mini ivf.  Less medication and better results.It was a long time ago, very I know for a fact I was very happy with my doctor We did Mini IVF and ICSI because of male factor infertility I started at New Hope FC in 2016! I met with whomever whenever they were available as I had no idea what I was doing nor what to expect. For a while, I felt I was just a number and on an assembly line. That is, until I met with Dr. Merhi. I started in 2016 with mini-IVF protocol. The plan was to use my own eggs w/ donor sperm. I'll skip the methods used by some of the Dr.'s & go right to Merhi. The meds used for cycles, etc., were pretty much the same w/ all Dr.'s I was using along the way. However, with Dr. Merhi, I began to feel supported and listened to. I began to realize I that if I brought more to the table (the right questions, etc.), he took the time with me, too, to explain things more clearly. When it came the for the egg retrievals, it was ONLY Dr. Merhi's that I felt ZERO pain. The other Dr.'s techniques, etc., I had a lot of pain during the procedures - no joke. After all the cycle efforts using my own eggs (always MY decision to make), I am the one who came to the hard realization that perhaps my eggs weren't viable. I took a break (mid-2017 to Fall 2019). When I returned to my efforts, I came in already knowing I was going to use a donor for eggs (& donor sperm). I only requested Dr. Merhi (after prior experiences w/ other Dr.'s there). Full disclosure: after the time away, new Dr.'s were there as well. I have NO idea how some of them are. I can only attest to my comparison of Dr. Merhi with about 4 others there. I ONLY worked with Dr. Merhi this time around. And - to GREAT SUCCESS!! I am pregnant...1st trimester almost over. :-)During the retrieval cycles, we used birth control pills, letrozole and Clomid pills, as well as Gonal-F and Cetrotide injections. My second cycle (which was when we had switched to Dr. Merhi) produced better results than the first cycle (with another doctor). I actually asked to be placed on a higher medication dose because I felt that the dosage in the first cycle wasn't stimulating enough follicles -- Dr. Merhi prescribed a higher dose of the Gonal-F and added in some of the other pills, and we were able to retrieve more eggs and create more embryos the second time around.

Regarding transfer, I had one failed FET and one successful FET. Leading up to the first FET, I was taking Prometrium (progesterone). After the first failure, Dr. Merhi expanded the medication protocol to include Progesterone in oil injections, a small dosage of Prednisone and baby aspirin. I believe that these medications helped my body to be more prepared to successfully accept the second FET.We did donor egg cycles  What was different vs. other donor cycles I'd done at another facility was: addition of low dose prednisone, progesterone suppositories, no lupron, no lovenox, no birth control pills prior to cycle initiation, Estradiol throughout.  On the second transfer, addition of 1 ml of progesterone sub q.  In my protocol for egg retrieval I was on gonal f, cetrotide, and clomid the two weeks leading up to my retrieval (all low doses).

For my transfer I followed the procedure with taking estradiol orally and suppositories of progesterone.IVF: clomid, letrozol and follistim, followed by Ovidrel as a trigger shot. For the transfer, progesterone suppositories and estrogen pills.tailored a fertility plan based on YOUR body, your hormones, your #’s, & the right timing, then I please advice you to go to Dr. Olcha. I underwent a mini-IVF, which we utilized letrozole, Chlomid, and injectable hormones prior to the egg retrieval.  After the retrieval I was placed on a low dosage of Estradiol and progesterone.Zhang didn't say we'll use this protocol or that one (and honestly, I didn't ask) other than mini-IVF. she used mini IVF treatment with minimum medications I was in lutueal phase cycle when my eggs were retrieved because my first attempt was not successful.  During the luteual phase cycle two eggs were retrieved and one genetically tested embryo day 6 blastocyst was transferred on January 20, I’m 7 weeks pregnant and extremely grateful with outcome.Natural cycle before transferring the embryo. Then taking Estrance and progesterone before the tranfer They told us clearly that we will have higher possibility to succeed to transfer more embryos at one time however we may also end up with twins. We said we absolutely don't want twins so we choose to do single embryo transfer. The mini-IVF was a waste of time for me. We only yielded 5-6 per round and had to cancel a few due to lack of stimulation. Was expensive and only one egg made it to blastocyst and was day 7. We were not told not to try and transfer it, but having spoken to other clinics now, i realize that was a waste of time and money. New Hope only transfers 1 embryo at a time.Dr Zhang and Dr Olcha suggested single embryo transfer to avoid any complications or birth defects. SET only for tested blasts
Willing to be flexible for 3 day untested embryosNo comment.Dr. Merhi transferred 2 normals for me -- ended up with one baby. Dr Makarov's preference was for us to transfer a single embryo, as she felt there was more risk with multiples.N/a I only had one embryoHe preferred one good egg for me, but I don't know what he preferred for others. Honestly, if I had more than one egg and demanded more than one be transferred he would have been against it but if I insisted would have listened to me, that's the feeling I get. Dr. Zhang was very clear on his preference for SETs, citing his ""one good egg"" philosophy. I was fine with that, and understood the research behind that approach.He was very much in favor of eSET due to risks of multiples.Yes, 1 embryo.  He suggested only 2at the timeThey prefer one embryo at a time but we chose two and they let usDue to my age, Dr. Merhi advised on single embryo transfer.  He educated us fully on the risks so we could make an educated decision.  Dr. Zhang recommended a single 5day embryo transfer and that is what we did.Dr Merhi had a strong advice for one embryo transfer due to the risk associated with multiple pregnancy but I suggested a multiple pregnancy so that I can finish my child birth sooner. Three embryos were transferred however two succeeded giving my twinssingle embryo transfer No we did not have elective single embryo.  My request was implant the healthiest embryo for implantation They recommend single embryo transfer. I am not at that stage. When we did our transfer in Cancun Mexico, the doctor there transferred four embryos all the time. Out of three cycles, I was pregnant but resulted in 10 week miscarriage. 

Dr. Zhang and his colleague transfers one embryo at a time per rules. He picks the best embryos for transfers. Didn’t get to the point Merhi will move one at a time. Although, and I will find out, he may move 1 normal and 1 mosaic together. They prefer single He prefers PGS tested blasts, eSET but is very open to multiple transfers of day 3 or mosaic embryos. We didn't get to that phase. Not yetDr Zhang really likes to implant only 1 embryo at a time he wants that embryo to have the best chance. he will implant mosaics too.When we first met Dr. Zhang, he stated they preferred to do single embryo transfer.  However, we were given an option to do up to 2 embryo transfers, but we agreed the single was the best for us.I have not made it to transfer yet, but New Hope in general and Dr. Lipkin specifically are highly supportive of a single embryo transfer as the default as far as I can tell.We have not experienced this as of yetThe reason why we went there - they bank embryos. I'd previously only done fresh cycles, and it wasn't working. They do multiple embryo transfer, but I think that was because of my age. My doctor recommended single embryo transfer as he thought I had a smaller body frame and we should avoid any risks with twinsIt seems that the doctor and clinic overall prefer to implant one embryo because they feel this gives the overall highest chance for success. But I think they allow the patient to decide this within reason.Dr. Merhi is very against multiple embryo transfer. Dr. LIU recommended multiple embryo transfer due to my age in order to increase pregnancy chances.Dr.Merhi, showed us, detailed studies, that it's in the best interest of the mother and the baby to have single embryo transfer, and we agreed.I never got to the transfer stage with his facility, so I can't comment on that. Had I, I would have preferred to transfer more than one at a time. Dr. Zhang whom presented himself as handling everything only to later pass me on to Dr. Lui explained that he felt confident that this Mini IVF would yield about 4 eggs. He suggested I run PGS genetic testing to ensure only the best embryos are selected. 4 were actually retrieved and 2 passed PGS. New Hope was opposed to having implant both at the same time but we went ahead with implanting both (5 day/PGS tested) embryos at once. I'm not sure. We have not planned any transfers yet.1 PGS embryo. Multiple embryos if untested. I never talked about this with Dr. Merhi because my wife and I agreed that we'd only ever opt to have ONE embryo transferred at a time. We did not want to risk multiples. It was not ever a topic for Dr. Merhi and I.I was told that it was safer for a woman at my age to transfer one embryo. Personally, my husband and I weren't interested in transferring more than that at one time, so we were already on board with Dr. Merhi's approach to eSET.Dr. Olcha preferred a single embryo transfer but was understanding if I wanted a multiple embryo transfer. No commentNoneBoth my pregnancy were singleton single embryo transfer ",6.899999999999998,6.899999999999998,"We did three cycles of Clomid, only two of which we completed with IUI. Dr Merhi is trying a more natural approach. But it wound up being ultra mini ivf with clomid only (one cycle he used letrozole).... each cycle I only produced one follicle. Considered more effective in women my age (43 at the time of treatment).We've done natural and mini ivfs at the clinic. I actually asked to be placed on a higher medication dose because I felt that the dosage in the first cycle wasn't stimulating enough follicles -- Dr. Merhi prescribed a higher dose of the Gonal-F and added in some of the other pills, and we were able to retrieve more eggs and create more embryos the second time around. Regarding transfer, I had one failed FET and one successful FET."
12,New Hope Fertility Center,cost,"mini ivf total cost $1500 with medicationThe grant was very helpful. I would not have been able to proceed without it.It has been over 2 years. I don't recall the cost. Our insurance covered most of it. We might have paid 6-7K out of our own pocket. Approximately $800/IUI cycleit was definitely expensive for just bloodwork and sonogramtrigger shot $100
never got to retrieval since I ovulated. before my next cycle/retrieval I switched to Dr Olcha thank God! Reasonable. My ultra mini IVF so far has cost about 10kI have benefits via my employeer so I shouldnt have paid anything other than for meds. Every bill had to be scruntized with Blue Cross as this clinic made assumptions about my plan. They ended up cutting me a check for almost $1000.00 of which i was over charged. I'm pretty sure i still over-paid but was so annoyed with them, I moved on. Too stressful and they're so rude.$3800 for FET. $350 for initial consultation. $500 for water sono.The egg freezing procedure costed me around 6k per cycle - much less than the 10k on average. To be honest I do not remember 75% was covered by our insurance for all fertility treatment and copay of 20$ for diagnostics and 30$ for doctor visit was charged. I have no fertility insurance coverage so everything for me is self paying.

Monitoring unlimited $800
Egg Retrieval $1250I think in total the cost was ~14k. The part that was annoying was since I was doing outside monitoring it cost me an additional 1k each month for NHFC to review the results.Egg retrieval & fertilization (excluding monitoring and drugs) ran around $4500 (with anesthesia).  This was pretty reasonable comparatively.  It's expensive.  No way around it, but if you're insurance doesn't cover IUIs and IVF, it's expensive.  The costs at NHFC seem to be comparable to that of other clinics in NYC.affordable 
Retrieval $1250 moderate...$2000 for extraction and $800 for monitoring (when not covered by insurance) $1000 freezing, $1000 fertilizing 2K for procedure; 500 for anesthesia; 2K for monitoring and bloodwork. Medications were ~2-3KI barely remember this now... but I think it was $18K total for all 4 retrievals and the transfer And then an additional for the genetic tests... $2500? pricey but not exorbitant. Second FET was approximately $3500 with additional $200 per appointment, plus meds. None were covered under insurance. First FET was part of a clinical study and I only paid for meds - appropriately $1500.IUIs were $800Costs were reasonable. Even though My insurance covered, they have plans to help out.They accepted my insurance Total costs were about 15kAt first it seemed like costs were reasonable. Realized later, all the individual charges add up and end up being more than rounds at another popular clinicMy insurance covered everything.Each cycle is about 5550 without medicationCosts were very economical. It was around 12-15,000The costs for self pay were more reasonable and fair than other clinics in other states.  Also, I was delighted that we did not have to pay for everything up front all at once as we had to do at another clinic.  They have a fair pricing and payment structure.The cost can’t be beat. Cost of an IVF cycle with Dr. Zhang is close to cost of IUI cycle at other practicesI don't have the exact amount but it was expensive even with insurance, For instance genetic screening I paid $100 as my out of pocket cost at my ob/gyn clinic with a group that they work with but at New Hope the clinic was charging over $700it was normal costsI was not informed of some procedures but the doctor said he would take care of it for me.A little over $6 K total, not including meds $150
The costs were in line with what was originally outlined - I did my research so I pretty much knew what they would be.  I think it was well worth the expense.  Costs were very good and way within budget. We were very happy. Roughly 10k, give or take. Much cheaper than the competition.retrieval - 1,250
fertilizing egg to embryo - 1,500
Trigger shot - $100
Monthly monitoring - 200-250/month (my health plan covers 80% so I guess cost would be 1k if not)IVF-4000
Medications- Gonal F and Clomid- 1500
Monitoring per month 800
IUI 800
Egg Transfer 3000 (Havent done this yet but we have to pay it soon)
750 PGS Testing per embryo... we are doing 3 embryos 2250 in totalWe’ve been doing fertility for 9 and half long years. My husband and I have seen numerous doctors. 

The billing at the Dr. Zhang’s office is very organized. There’s always three there. They know your name and what needs to be paid. They even tell you what it’s for and if the insurance paid or not and explained why. They even have online service to pay online now too. They are friendly. 

My husband and I pay out of pocket fertility for nine and half long years. For donor eggs we have $13,200 for 6 eggs. Then they tell us how survived. For example, embryologist will email and tell me they get 5 out of 6 ready to be sent out for genetic testing. Before sending we have to pay $750 per embryo to be tested first before being sent out. Ones we do that we have 7-10 days to wait and they will email with results. Then they will email again and tell us how many survived and how many healthy with grades on them and explanation of their grades. 

So imagine having failed donor eggs many many times $13,200 x 5 times. We are financially medically in debt. We need help! Fairly reasonable Insurance is mercifully covering monitoring (I still pay $40 copay). 
The genetics tests is expensive $2-$5K. The retrievals are $1500-2000. It’s was about $6000 plus medication. This was only retrieval. We never got to transfer. Consult $350
Unlimited monitoring for 30 days - $800
Retrieval + ICSI + freezing + PGS - 4000
For the first egg retrieval we were covered by insurance. The second time, our plan had changed and it was out of network. 2750 for egg retrieval and fertilization (ICSI). 550 for anesthetic. 750 for NICS PGS testing (which includes free ICSI) and 1200 for freezing...some additional costs as well.$800 per month unlimited monitoring 
$1250 egg retrieval
$800 for genetic testing 
$2700 for embryo testing it was very expensive and the prices kept getting higher and higher. when i first started a transfer was 1200 when i left it was 2500. - We were lucky that my husband's insurance assisted us with cost.
- We had a co-pay that we always paid upon check-inWe are currently under insurance (2 cycles) so it has just been co-pays plus about $500 for mini IVF medications. Monitoring was about $600, retrievals and testing would be about $7kIt was covered by my insurance. My insurance covered most of it but i paid around $2k for genetic testing, medications and copayIt depends on what you do. It is much cheaper than most clinics if you are paying for your own cycles. We have never had insurance which covers ivf so I have no idea how that would work.The cost is significantly less than the other clinics we looked at. The procedures are less costly and they prescribed fewer medications at lower doses. A typical IVF cycle for egg retrieval and fertilization under a mini ivf can cost up to $4500-5500.
Depending if you are doing a frozen 5 day or fresh 3 day transfer. There is a separate flat rate monitoring fee of $800 
Medications is separate and I acquired it through my insurance with co payments.They were quite reasonable, and definitely lower compared to peersA good portion was covered by my insurance. However, I spent roughly 10,000 OOP (between medications, costs of retrievals and the anesthesia)Mini-IVF costs were very reasonable at nearly less than half the cost compared to conventional stimulation protocols. Also, out of pocket expenses such as PGS and ICSI were less than at institutional clinics. Genetic screening $199 (useless), monitoring flat monthly fee of $800, egg retrieval $4,000 (even one egg)I did not have insurance coverage so it was put of pocket. Mild ivf cost about$6,000 which included cost of medications. Luteal Phase retrieval cost $250. And PGS for one embryo clst $750Dont recall all the costs but the biggest thing to consider is that its $200 per lab appointment. You can pay $800 a month for unlimited. This was what we hadnt planned would be most expensive as they constantly had me come in to determine whether my levels and lining was ready for implant. Took too long and too much money. They creatively use insurance, to minimize uncovered costs. My out of pocket costs were probably about 5K. I did not get any bills yet, except the anesthesia bill for $500. I think the rest might be coming later. I also had to pay for the lupron trigger: $10 or $25 in cash, I don't remember. This was a lot of money for 10 IU in a syringe that they filled, considering that an entire 2.8 mL vial  of luprion is $10 co-pay, which I know from my other IVF procedure.about 4K per retrieval + medsApproximately $5,000 per mini-IVF cycle. We dod 9 cycles.It depends on what you are doing. The clinic is much cheaper than most US ivf clinics. We didn't use insurance so I don't know about that at all.I had insanely generous Cigna insurance which New Hope accepted. Again - we were very lucky. Will never see insurance like that again$4000 for a retrieval freeze all cycle plus $800 for 1 month of monitoring. It was supposed to be a free cycle and we now owe over $10,000 dollars.The billing dept. is VERY good/trustworthy at trying to submit everything to your insurance first. Depending on what your coverage is, the costs of all procedures, monitoring, etc., are comparable to most places. They are reasonable in relation to other places, depending on what you're having done. Not going to lie -- it's EXPENSIVE. But - I feel we're a special case: in the end, after several efforts using my own eggs w/ IUI donor sperm and IVF, we chose to also go with an egg donor. I mean - I could have put this child (the one I'm pregnant with as I type!) through its first two years of college! Some of the meds were covered by my insurance - not all of them. Some of the procedures were covered by insurance - not all of them.We paid out of pocket for costs as our insurance would not cover any of it. Costs, with medication, ran around $10,000 - $12,000 per retrieval cycle. The FET is around $3000.

It helped to get medication for a pharmacy recommended to me by a friend (Medcal Pharmacy), which had a special discount with patients from New Hope and also delivered the medications straight to my door, free of charge.We’ve paid under 3,000 in total for both the egg retrieval and transfers.Costs were affordable for an iui and ivf treatment protocol. My costs equated to approximately 5K between doctor visits, actual IVF, medications, and copays~$20k all inApprox 10k ",6.899999999999998,6.899999999999998,"mini ivf total cost $1500 with medicationThe grant was very helpful.

14,NYU Langone Fertility Center,doctor,"As a patient, I had an exceptional experience with Dr. DeVore and cannot recommend her highly enough. She is by far the best doctor I have ever been to. There are a few things that really stand out:

I always felt like Dr. DeVore cared about me personally -- she respected my personal values and my comfort zone, and she made recommendations that were tailored specifically to me. 

She is compassionate but also fully candid and honest. She never sugar coated any of the facts, and just as importantly, gave me ALL the information that I needed to feel comfortable about the decisions that we were making. She is extremely thorough in her analysis and detail oriented. I felt empowered and fully understood the process and next steps. After every appointment, I would walk out of the room, feeling like we made the right decisions. Not everything we tried worked out in the beginning, but the decision-making process and information was so clear and upfront, that we were able to pivot as needed. The entire IUI/IVF process can be extremely complicated, so this piece was HUGE.

Dr. DeVore always went the extra mile. In December, Dr. DeVore let me know that in Jan 2020, there'd be a new law which meant that some New York companies would need to provide full coverage for IVF treatment. Dr. DeVore did extra research on this, guided me through the process, and even helped me follow up with billing (and insurance) to make sure we had the information needed. She even wrote a personal letter to our insurance company to ensure everything was organized and in order before starting IVF. This was HUGE and such a stress relief as the process can typically feel very overwhelming given the potential costs. 

I really felt like Dr. DeVore cared. I know she has a busy schedule and tons of patients, but you would never know. Dr. DeVore gave her FULL attention and dedication to me at every appointment. Even if I had questions outside of appointments, she would get back to me right away too! I've never experienced that level of personal care and can't thank her enough!

Dr. Grifo is all about numbers.  He is extremely smart, continues to do research and I find him to be candid and honest with me. After three transfers and no successful pregnancy, he is not only encouraging me to continue but ensures me that this process will result in a baby it is just a matter of time and numbers (at some point it will work).  He understands how frustrating that is and is constantly encouraging me and letting me know how well I'm doing despite the anxiety, fear, pain, discomfort and hormonal roller coaster.  I find him open to working with other doctors (even when he doesn't agree with their ideology), he is willing to try different things than what his normal protocol allows for. He is open to my suggestions and patiently answers pages and pages worth of prepared questions I have presented him with after doing my own research.  In dealing with autoimmune issues he has been particularly accommodating and his ongoing work on Chronic Endometritis has been extremely informative. Dr. Keefe is kind, warm and compassionate, and takes time to explain and answer questions in great detail. I've only seen hime twice, both times for consultation. My only negative is that I wish I would see him more throughout the process. I only saw him for initial consultations. The rest of the time you deal mainly with the nurse coordinator and other doctors and technicians. Dr. Wertz is direct and clear, she provides options and leaves it up to me to decide. I like it, because with unexplained infertility there is no one answer, no one solution and personal instincts and statistical numbers are the only two things to rely on. I had a polyp removal with Dr. Wertz, she mastered it perfectly. She didn't give me false illusions that this will solve my problem and it didn't. I had 3 IUIs and, again, I new the numbers and understood that chances are not very high. Even though I did have hopes, still my heart didn't break when this didn't work. I appreciated doctor's manner and support during this time, it helped me stay strong and avoid emotional rollercoaster. Dr. Hodes was kind when she had to deliver bad news, but it was hard to get her on the phone. I felt I had to advocate for / educate myself on a lot of the procedures and ways to supplement fertility.Dr. Grifo does a great job about running through the statistical odds of pregnancy success while also maintaining a level of compassion / acted as a quasi therapist during my treatments. He is well respected in the industry and I feel comfortable in his care.I would recommend Dr Licciardi to someone with a simple case. For someone with a more complex case or poorer prognosis, needing more customized care, I would NOT recommend him at all. I changed doctors after my cancelled retrieval and I am extremely happy I did so.Dr. Licciardi is great. I still have his voicemail saved from when our transfer didn't work. He was honest and compassionate about what had happened (""I wish I had better news, and I know how disappointing this must feel."") but was still optimistic about the future (""Give me a call when you are ready and we will go over next steps."")  Dr Berkeley is a professional, highly informative doctor. My partner and I both appreciated his honest, straightforward explanations and approach to our situation. He is not overly optimistic about the odds of success. He gives you the facts and I appreciated that as a patient.Dr. Licciardi was my doctor but I saw him only twice during the process. We met at the consult and then he preformed one ultrasound. I was surprised when I learned he wasn't the one conducting my retrieval but he called me and put me at ease about who was doing the retrieval. I really thought Dr. Licciardi's care was excellent during the process. He was always accessible by phone and email, and he called me several times to keep me updated and to check on me. I definitely felt that he cared and I wasn't just another number in the factory.

. I think Dr. Licciardi wanted to manage my expectations because he told me to expect 10-14 eggs, but 22 were retrieved and 20 mature eggs were frozen (age 36). What this actually means I really don't know because Dr. Licciardi made it clear that there are no guarantees. Dr. Grifo is very straight forward with his communication. He is blunt when delivering statistics and probabilities. However, he has his own story of infertility with his wife and children and he has compassion for what his patients are going through. He is invested in figuring out why things aren't working and provides comfort and hope when needed. He is extremely knowledgeable and respected in this industry. Dr. Grifo was recommended to us by a very close family friend. After starting our journey with another doctor, when IVF became the best next step, we had to switch for insurance purposes. Our first visit with Dr. Grifo was comprehensive and very informative. He asked us a tone of questions, talked us through the science of the process in ways that we could understand and was sure to create space and time for any questions that we might have. My husband and I felt very comfortable with him and were eager to get started. Throughout my treatment, I  was fortunate to visit the clinic on his ""days"" which always made me feel better. He was always very thorough and would talk us through the implications of anything that was going on, offering encouragement and support. When our first transfer failed, it was very evident that Dr. Grifo was upset for us. He called us and scheduled a face to face to talk through options and next steps. He assured us it wasn't our fault and that there was hope in terms of next steps both traditional and more innovative, and even offered ideas based on his latest research. He suggested further testing to help inform the course of action. I  saw him for a biopsy, which was uncomfortable, but I always appreciated how Dr. Grifo would talk me through the procedure to help pacify any fears or discomfort. Lastly, we were very fortunate that Dr. Grifo was able to transfer our second embryo, which was successful! It was so great to have him there, and provide us with the confidence and calm that we needed. He told us it was his birthday, and that he had a good feeling about it! When we saw him at one of the first ultra sounds after being pregnant, it was clear how thrilled he was for us. He expressed his joy and confidence in us as parents, and allowed us to hear the heart beat as many times as we wanted! We simply could not have done this without him and we are so thankful for his knowledge and expertise. Dr. Hodes is blunt but warm. She did seem to be quite rushed each time my partner and I met with her and I ended up scheduling a second consultation with her because I left my first appointment feeling overwhelmed and confused. Dr Licciardi has great bedside manner and very personable. He seemed interested in getting to know us as a couple and he explained our test results to us in ways we could understand. He was thorough in all the tests he recommended and always told us his expert opinion, not just what we wanted to hear. He also listened to me and my concerns while going through IUI and I felt that we came up with my fertility plan together, which helped make me feel more involved and in control. Dr Licciardi never pushed IVF on us even though he believes that will be our best route, but knowing we weren’t ready and wanted to give IUI a shot, he was supportive and helped us to try and make that happen. After 4 failed attempts we decided to take a break and I started acupuncture. He was supportive and even encouraged it. We will be starting IVF in May. The only weakness I see is that I only saw dr Licciardi twice. Once during consultation and the next when he performed one of my IUIs. I’m not sure if that’s normal in all clinics but he is responsive and helpful over email which really helps ease my nerves when I have questions or concerns. My two friends have had success with Dr Licciardi so I’m hopeful and excited to see what happens. He is just wonderful. I had an experience with one other doctor as a consult and another for treatments, Dr. Grifo was the first to treat me like a human. He adjusted my plans accordingly. He was compassionate and empathatic and while I didn't see him often, he called and we spoke on the phone as long as I needed to to feel comfortable. He also shared tips outside of the treatment protocol to help give us the best chances possible.Dr Fino is great. We did not see her every visit as the clinic's schedule rotated. Certain doctors did certain procedures on specific days. But our consultations and appointments with her were always great. She took time to listen to our concerns and fully explain things. It was never rushed.Dr. Fino was very thorough and professional. She patiently explained the whole process to me including risks and benefits in great detail. I took down notes during my consultation, and by the end, I had a whole page of notes. The most important thing was that she got me an amazing result for my egg retrieval. I was 37 yo, and she managed to retrieve 23 and freeze 21! I was thrilled! I was expecting about half the number of eggs given my age. On top of that, I had requested no anesthesia to save on the cost of an anesthesiologist. Basically Dr. Fino just worked with me throughout the procedure. If it was too painful, she would pause and then continue when I was ready. Even with the pausing, she worked fast and was done in 15-20min. I'm still amazed that she retrieved that many eggs and with no anesthesia!Our takeaway was that had ICSI been performed at the outset we would have had a successful experience.   We were told NYU waits 24 hours to determine whether it's necessary ""to save costs"" - at $40k / IVF pop I'm pretty much all in already . . . trying to do everything possible to achieve a successful outcome and wish I'd been educated further upfront and been allowed to make my own cost/benefit analysis.  Instead, we were left with ""try again and go ahead and do ICSI upfront, sure"" or ""go somewhere else"" or ""give up"" - not ideal choices but then again nothing about  this process is ideal.   Punchline - I liked Dr. Grifo but didn't think he ""dug in"" the first round to maximize its success so couldn't recommend him to anyone.   Perhaps upon further tries it would become a more tailored, personal process but we won't try there again - felt factory-like. I was diagnosed with a full thickness intramural fibroid that was pushing into the uterine cavity, preventing me from conceiving. Dr. Fino initially recommended that she remove the portion of the fibroid pushing into the cavity via a hysterscopic myomectomy. After my first surgery with her, she suggested we go back in and clean the cavity one more time before proceeding with IVF. I agreed. However, I should have followed my gut. The remaining fibroid continued to be a problem and Dr. Fino continued to suggest 2-3 more hysterscopic myomectomies. In this day and age, women successfully have lap procedures to remove fibroids before conceiving. I do not think that Dr. Fino had my best interest at heart. I sought a second opinion with a fibroid specialist who removed the remaining fibroid via robotic myomectomy. I healed well, transferred my care to RMA and am now 9 weeks pregnant after a successful IVF cycle. I am so happy that I listened to my gut.  I would have appreciated her referring me to someone who knew how to properly manage and remove intramural fibroids; instead of performing procedures that put my uterus at risk for scaring. She is money hungry and that's the bottom line. With Doctor Hodes I finally feel that I can drop my guard and trust the advice that I'm getting.  She is compassionate, smart, patient, communicative and understands the importance of fertility treatment. She's a great doctor and I felt so comfortable and safe under her care.  Dr. Hodes was very honest on our first meeting. I was expecting her to turn me down with my numbers but she explained age is the underlying factor and we still had a chance. She did express that we were quickly running out of time and needed to jump straight to IVF. I was not immediately made aware that I should try and bank eggs.... I found this out at a later appointment. To which she also said I’d probably need a few cycles until we were successful. She gave honest expectations but was never hard about it. I feel she truly cares for the success of my cycle and was excited when we started. I was lucky to see her for all of my week day appointments and she even did my egg retrieval. After receiving the results from genetic testing I requested a call with her in which I heard back in 2 hours. She assured me I can set up a call whenever I need to answer any questions. Doctor Brooke is warm and i believe a great physician but i think the NYU set up is not conducive to spending time with any of their patients.  Communication is hard since you have to go through a portal or an email.  Answers most always come via a nurse and that nurse will be a different person every time.  This combined with perhaps a complex case, makes a recipe for a lot of confusion.He was compassionate but After the initial half hour consultation there were no follow ups. I would have appreciated a closer relationship with my doctor, especially having gone through 3 unsuccessful cycles. Dr. Goldman is smart and patient. She walks me thru every step and every outcome. She is direct but kind, and in my case has been cautiously optimistic, which is just what I need to push thru the IUI efforts. When I have asked for additional testing, she and her team provided it as well as analysis of the results. She also hears me when I am weighing the costs of IVF vs continuing to do IUIs, and never pressures me about IVF. She is wonderfully steady, warm, upbeat and quick to laugh - every single attribute I personally need on this journey.Spotting Grifo in the clinic is like spotting a celebrity. You see him once in a while in the corridors, and if you are lucky, he'll see you for 1 ultrasound out of 15. When you catch him, in your first appointment or a consultation call post PGS results, he is indeed a star. He will give you his full attention, the full truth, and will be blunt about your chances, which I appreciate, but I can see some women not being a fan of. He knows his numbers inside out, which is great, but that in itself can make you feel like another number compounding that average, that median, and keep you on your tip toes secretly hoping for the moment he will pull you aside and say ""look, I followed your case day by day, I know a lot about you now, and you are not part of this statistic anymore... you are you and this is what I think!"" It's not going to happen, but emotionally I'm in that phase now, as I wait for for my 2nd IVF cycle yet (I'm banking after 1 PGS-tested euploid embryo already frozen).
The retrieval is performed by the doctor in attendance that day, so if Grifo is there 1 out of 5 days, your chances of seeing him are 20%. 
I just went through the embryo transfer course from Fertility IQ and am now freaking out about the performance variances across different doctors within the same clinic. Looking forward to touching base with Grifo to know his POV on this.One person who knows Dr. Berkeley well at his clinic described him to us once as a man who can look at a set of numbers in front of him and explain patterns that he immediately sees amongst them.  There is no doubt that he is has an extraordinarily scientific brain.  But along with this, he is compassionate, honest and caring with his patients.  Though NYU is large and sees many daily patients, not once has Dr. Berkeley or any of his staff made me feel like a 'number.'  In truth, Dr. Berkeley spends more time with us one on one that any other doctor I've ever known.  He always wants to make sure you fully understand what is going on in your treatment, both before and during any treatment course.  One very positive thing I will also say about Dr. Berkeley is that he is very pro-patient in his patient counseling.  I am sure many of us have experienced well meaning partners at times who have wanted to do treatments that require less financial risk, at the expense of not working as well.  He reminds partners in the room that it is, in fact, the female patient undergoing treatment that has to undergo the procedures, and that they should really be the ones to consult carefully before making any hard and fast decisions.  Dr. Berkeley is always in the patient's corner - and this is very reassuring.I felt like she had hesitation when I asked if any of the fertility treatments were linked to causing cancer.  Once she told me no, other times she would say ""well you wouldn't want to do 10 cycles""! And it left me feeling very uneasy and unclear.  I also somewhat felt like a lot of her recommendations were a shot in the dark guess rather than specific to me and my needs. She also hasn't followed up with me in months. I feel like she only wants to push IVF because it's most profitable for her.  Another reason why I felt like just a number in all honesty.  She might not be characterized as overtly warm & friendly - her manner is more grounded, straightforward, blunt. I really appreciated this about her. Her direct manner and her honest, thoughtful input (as I made the decision to try this) was what I wanted and needed. I never felt rushed with her but also her directness cut to the heart of the matter so we were not wasting time in our meetings either. I found her to have an intelligent, dry sense of humor which I appreciated. She is very no-nonsense and can seem a bit distant as a result; however, she clearly cares about her work, her patients and helping them make a baby. I like a straightforward doctor, which Dr. Noyes is. That doesn't mean she lacks compassion, just that like me, she gets to the point and I feel confident that she understands my situation and is committed to helping me get the results I want. While I am only about a third of the way through my overall fertility plan, my interactions with her so far have made me feel heard and given me hope that this process will be successful. Dr. Noyes has created a plan that perfectly aligns with the desires I shared with her, and as we've hit bumps in the road (like a miscarriage after success with my first IUI treatment), she's been compassionate and adjusted our plan accordingly. I liked her because she doesn't show any emotion. She tell you what she thinks right directly. But I felt that she didn't give me numerous options. ""It's only one thing that you should do is this"" something like that. She is not bad person, she is good person but not friendly person. She tells me what's happening and what's going to happen to me without comfort. If you want just get to the business without emotional support then she is right for you.Dr. Fino is exceptionally knowledgable, practical and compassionate.  She spends at least 20 minutes with me every call we have and thoroughly answers all of my questions.  She's also exceptionally open to hearing what research I have done or approaches I would like to consider.  I appreciate that after my first failed transfer of a PGS tested embryo she gave me information on a reproductive immunologist to further explore additional options.  There is nothing constructive to say about Dr Fino. She is a great communicator, pays attention to every detail in our paperwork/conversations and is extremely compassionate. We just did retrieval earlier this week and our numbers were good. Dr Fino noted that my wife was at risk for OHSS and carefully adjusted her medications and schedule to get the best possible results with minimal discomfort (even though this information was usually relayed to us by the nurses).Dr. Hodes-Wertz is very kind and patient. She is also very smart and professional. This balance is very comforting as a patient, especially when dealing with a sensitivity of fertility. Dr. Hodes-Wertz took the time to call me on a couple occasions when she needed to provide unpleasant diagnosis and spent the time to answer my questions on the phone and in person in follow up appointments. She never made me feel judged for asking many questions about the diagnosis and treatment. I felt comfortable moving forward with a Salpingectomy because she made me feel comfortable and confident about the surgery and outcome. After getting pregnant from my first cycle of IVF and later experiencing a Pprom, Dr. Hodes-Wertz provided treatment that my OB did not offer such as an Endometrial Biopsy. I am currently in my second IVF cycle with Dr. Hodes-Wertz and I have a very hopeful outlook on a successful pregnancy due to her care. kara was one of the best doctors I have ever interacted with.  She was compassionate and realistic.  She advised where required and told us when a decision had to be ours.  She was patient with us and always willing to answer questions and spend the necessary time.  She made a difficult situation as comfortable as possible.My husband and I went to Dr. Grifo for an initial consultation. He spoke to us for about an hour without focusing on our case - he just kept referring to statistics, graphs, and numbers. We told him that we had a fertility doctor who had already done all the standard tests on us, but that we had decided to also meet with him to be confident that we were comfortable with our decision. We couldn't have been clearer that we were there to gather information. He then proceeded to show me to a room and asked me to put on a robe so that he would examine me. Not understanding at all why this would be part of an initial consultation, and even though I asked him repeatedly about it, in an effort to do everything I could to have a baby, I ended up submitting myself to an ultrasound and a swab. I was confused, felt completely taken advantage of, and left that place feeling like a machine. A few weeks later, I received a bill, as my insurance was not covering the tests he did on me that day, something I have no doubt he knew. So I ended up having to pay for those completely unnecessary tests that I had never asked for. Dr. Hodes has an excellent bed side manner because she replies promptly, listens fully to concerns and takes the time to explain her answers. She never seemed overly worried and was honest and transparent about things like the risk of engaging in exercise throughout the process. I don't think Dr. Hodes could have done anything better at all really. I recommend my friends to her. 

On the doctors, maybe what specifically made her bedside manner so good. How did she adjust the protocol from the first to the second treatment. Did she air on the side of conservatism or do you think she was pretty aggressive. Anything she could do differently that would make her better.Dr. Grifo is very straight forward and says it like it is. He is very into his statistics and its all about the numbers. He provides you with the different options for you to make the decision. To me he basically admitted that he has no idea why I am not conceiving and said its a luck game. He even said ""If you tried naturally for 5 years you would probably get pregnant"". He said if I want to rush he would do IVF(which is costly) but then also suggested I try 3 letrizole IUI cycle after having 3 failed clomid IUI cycles.  With Dr. Grifo I tried 1 letrizole cycle which unfortunately failed. I suggested to try an injectable IUI cycle as I wanted to try something new; however, he did not agree with that and said that he would want to do IVF instead of injectables. I did not understand from him or his nurses why it is a problem to try injectables before IVF.  Also I have an autoimmune condition; however, he does not believe it affects my infertility; however, he was open to me being on certain medications such as blood thinners if needed during a cycle. But they would have to be prescribed by another Dr. such as hematologist, rheumatologist , RI.  Right now I put a hold on treatment as i am moving apartments, i am looking into a Dr. who will try an injectable IUII think Dr. Licciardi is a very caring doctor and has a lot of patients and I appreciated his attention during our appointments but wish I had called him more often during actual treatments to see how he would have responded. As I wrote earlier, he does always call back within a reasonable amount of time but doesn't always seem to know why I would be calling and he would answer questions that I think are significant pretty quickly, so that I wondered if he was considering all of my own unique information or just answering generally what he would tell a patient in a similar situation.Dr. Berkeley was great in the initial consultation.  He was also great at reviewing the probabilities of women my age being able to conceive using my own eggs.  He is very knowledgeable and experienced in this field, so we trusted him completely.  He knows what he's doing.   The only critical feedback I would give Berkeley to date is communicating better with the patient 1) he didn't mention during the initial consultation how many rounds of ovulation induction and retrieval this might take, especially for someone in my age group. 2) Each failed cycle, we would have appreciated a sit-down face-to-face meeting rather than a follow-up phone call.  Since the initial consult and the first retrieval, I haven't really met with Berkeley, other than the occasional ultrasound during morning monitoring.  Depending on the schedule, I was able to see other doctors at the clinic during morning monitoring, retrievals, transfers, and other procedures.  Those other doctors, during my short and limited interactions, especially Grifo and Hodes-Wertz, exhibited greater empathy and compassion, which I viewed as a plus.I felt she showed compassion on my initial visits. My first retrieval yielded 7 eggs. My second only 2. When I came out of moderate sedation, i was very tearful that only 2 eggs had been retrieved. In their make shift PACU she seemed rushed and didn't really console me. I guess she was busy, but it did put me off a bit with her. I also didn't feel like she really adjusted my hormone dosages the second time to yield more eggs. I felt like she kept the same protocol sh had for my first retrieval. I wish she would have altered it and maybe I would have gotten more eggs.Dr. Licciardi is one of the top in his field, but does not have the arrogance that sometimes comes with that. He is patient, and caring. He takes the time to listen and explain. Though we did not see him at most appointments, we spoke to him often and felt comfortable that he was overseeing our treatment throughout. We were not from NY, and Dr. Licciardi worked with us, to enable us to do part of our cycle with my local Dr. Dr. Licciardi does lecture around the world so he is not always in the office, but even when traveling his staff can usually reach him,Dr. Berkeley is not an easy man to reach but when you have an appointment with him, he takes all the time you need to explain every details of the treatment options and answers patiently all your questions. He never made me feel like my questions were stupid or like I am wasting his time. He is compassionate and understanding.I am so happy I saw Dr. Grifo as my first fertility doctor as he was so great at explaining everything. He explained the science and numbers but in a compassionate way. He's clearly seen it all and would give advice, but also understands that every experience is individual and personal and deserves that attention. My only complaint is that I would have preferred to have seen him in person during my iui'sDr Grifo was transparent from the get go about our chances of success. He used data regularly to supplement his commentary. He was so, so human and made us feel like heroes for undertaking IVF, as opposed to failures who couldn't conceive. He shared his own story of infertility and all of the associated feelings. I felt so comfortable from that first visit; I was depressed, angry and confused, and Dr Grifo was understanding of each of these emotions and offered suggestions to help. He never made me feel like just a number. He was patient in person and by phone, always answering our questions and personalizing his advice.I only saw Dr. Hodes-Wertz 3 times during my treatment, but found her to be very informative with good bedside manner. After our first meeting with her we felt very confident that she knew what she was doing and we were in good hands.  As a patient I met her once- after that I was thrown into the NYU system. I can't really rate her as I was her patient because I hardly ever dealt with her at all- when I would finally be able to pin her down on the phone I had good clear candid conversations with her- I think she was clear and understood my perspective and honored that- but I did not get any sort of follow up from her and no human communication- even when I got pregnant- My interaction with her was limited other than determining a plan of action pre- and post-cycle.  I never doubted her abilities, but did not have direct contact with her during the course of treatment to explain why certain decisions around timing and hormone levels were being made.Dr. Grifo's strengths: his success rate, his expertise, his compassion. The only weakness is that it's hard to get in touch with him directly and sometimes his assistant does not respond for a few days. Dr. Hodes was by my side during the lowest point of my life, and I don't know how I would have gotten through that time without her.  She was honest with the chances of success, but she never wavered in her commitment to my case.  I was not an ""easy"" case and the odds for success were not in my favor, but I felt safe and cared for in Dr. Hodes' care.  She always took the time to explain things to me and answer all of my questions.  We found Dr. Licciardi to be smart, experienced and to the point. I would recommend him without hesitation, but perhaps not to someone who wants a doctor to be extremely warm and compassionate and hold their hand throughout the process. I wouldn't say that Dr. L was NOT warm or compassionate, but I also wouldn't call him a warm & fuzzy doctor. That was not important to us – we only wanted a doctor who was very experienced with a track record of success – so we were very happy with him.I really like Dr. Berkley.  I had seem Dr. Stein at RMA before and found him to be on the cold side and he jumped right to IVF as my only option. Dr. Berkley on the other hand was compationate and thorough. Spent almost an hour chatting with me about all of my options and recommended that we explore several less invasive (and less expensive) options first.  He explained a great deal about infertility and made the whole process easier to understand.   he spoke to me like a person and his equal and never made me fell silly about even my most basic questions.  He ordered tests that were needs and did In face uncover some medical  issues I didn't even know about - specially scars tissue in uterus from a D&C.  I would recommend him to everyone. Dr Noyes is a competent doctor and is a good diagnostician. She was on target with her predictions.  Her demeanor is not for everyone.  She is blunt and some people take offense at her bluntness.  I appreciated it and had no fertility issues (I froze and when I was ready I conceived) so it worked for me.  But I am not sure if I were looking for hand holding that she would be the first doctor to whom I would go. Again, Dr. Berkeley is a fantastic physician, but NYU's program is simply awful. After a failed cycle, we were told our only hope was a donor egg cycle. It took 1 year and 4 months before we heard from the donor program. By that time, we had switched clinics. I ended up hospitalized with severe OHSS but was able to maintain a healthy pregnancy.... I saw Dr Liccardi when I first went to the clinic and spoke to him numerous times before my course of treatment. When my husband and I were given all of the information about Tammy specific treatment it was reviewed by a nurse in a room with other couples. I saw dr liccardi infrequently during treatment. He did not do my transfer or retreval. He did however play a more active role in my care once I was full of fluid- and eventually hospitalized. ... this should never have happened. Dr. Berkeley knows what he is doing.  He is a veteran that is VERY up to date on the latest protocols and procedures.  His office is equipped with all that he would ever need to stay on top of current trends and successful procedures.  But more important than that, his bedside manner gives you confidence that you have somebody in your corner to even the odds when you feel like everything is against you.We loved Dr Grifo. He was upfront with us and extremely empathetic abut our case. He knows what he is doing and is confident in his approach, which turned out to be the right one for us-- we got pregnant on the first try. He made sure we were fully educated every step of the way.  He was understanding and supportive of my anxieties in the operating room at the hospital and during treatments at the fertility center. Dr. Fino is an extremely intelligent and humane doctor who is well-versed in the latest research. She is collaborative and not paternalistic. At NYU you definitely don't see your doctor every visit but I always knew she was looking out for me. Dr. Fino let me try IVF with my own eggs three times even though my results were always atrocious (bad eggs). When I switched to donor eggs my donor had her best cycle ever and I'm on my second successful pregnancy from that cycle.I came to Dr. Grifo after having a bad experience at another, very highly renowned practice in NYC. I felt like a number in that office, from the way the billing office and office managers dealt with me, to the nurses whom I saw each morning and even my own doctor. I felt that my doctor had a terrible bedside manner and moved me very quickly through the process with little regard to my feelings or what I was ready for. When I came to Dr. Grifo, I was upset and confused, and he very clearly communicated to me my situation, how difficult it is for anyone (not just the 'infertile') to get pregnant, and how it is important to give it time, but also to be smart about it and maximize your chances for a healthy pregnancy, using all of the available data that we have. My other doctor had seen me through one chemical pregnancy, one frozen embryo transfer which failed, and suggested that I seek surrogacy options immediately. I felt as though she was speaking more to her numbers than me as a patient, and a person.Experience was very satisfactory. Staff was very professional and attentive, very keen for detail and always took care of any issues and addressed any concerns right away. I was surprises to learn that my phone calls can be answered so quickly. Very efficient communication between staff, any issue or questions raised with one staff, always been addressed and responded by appropriate party without initiating same concern twice.  I was very impressed with the efficiency and precision NYU Firtility clinic ran. I never had to wait for longer than few minutes to be seem, despite the large volume of patients treated by this facility.  I have ben seen by different Providers during my monitoring cycle, yet the communication between all staff was superb. They knew exactly where we left off and where to pick-up and where to go next. Very impressed.  No regrets. Only wish it would be cheaper procedure.  My results were not as great  as I expected, however in the process I found out that I have a medical condition that would make it hard for me to conceive naturally and egg Freezing was a great decision on my part. Hopefully some day it will be worth all the expenses. Dr. Berkeley clearly has good credentials and a prestigious post at a well-known university fertility clinic.  I thought he was professional the one (!) time I got to meet him (at my consult).  I was taken aback by the fact I did not hear from him again until after my missed miscarriage/D&C at 6 weeks.  My tissue from the D&C had been tested, and it was triploidy, which he explained to me over the phone.  I advised him that Dr. Noyes, who had seen me during this very brief pregnancy mentioned during a monitoring appointment (as it began to become clearer that this was a missed miscarriage) that I had a uterine fibroid and had been incredulous as to why no one had pointed this out to me before.  While my fibroid didn't cause the triploidy, of course (which he pointed out), I felt that missing such a thing at my initial consult the month before (which included an initial ultrasound) was pretty inexcusable.Dr Berkley is a funny guy with great bed side manner. He went through a rigorous initial consultation with us.making sure we covered all details.  He is also a brilliant dr. He is well experienced and knew exactly what should be done. He also pushed the limits to maximize results. His short comings is that he is so busy that it could take a long time to set up apts or get return calls. Also his medicine is pretty conventional he didn't discuss any naturopathic options Please see previous description. During the procedure it felt like a mill - there were back to back appointments - I felt that I received great treatment.I partially answered this with the ""number or person"" question.  Dr. Licciardi was very upbeat with my initial assessment and FSH levels, and quickly got me started on testing and polyp removal to make my chances as high as possible (I had never tried to get pregnant and was doing this with donor sperm).  When my FSH levels subsequently elevated, he was sympathetic but to the point that I might get lucky with IUI and he would support that for 2 or 3 cycles.  I think some women might have taken that as uncaring, but I felt like he was only being honest and not judging me nor did he want to mislead me.  When I failed at IUI but my FSH and estrogen had improved I met with him regarding IVF.  He was not in favor of it, but said we could try and then he had a positive, supportive attitude throughout that process.  When it failed and I cried, saying I felt stupid for trying at my age (I was at that point 44 years old), he told me I shouldn't feel bad at all about that and he seemed quite genuine with his supportive comments.  I commented that I had a family member interested in donating eggs and he was very positive about it.  Overall, I think he is neither mushy-concerned nor cold about his assessments.  He seems genuinely interested in his patients and in helping them.  And when I pushed a little to do something he did not recommend, he quickly took my side.  This was important because I think being very downbeat about the process or feeling like your doctor is annoyed or unsupportive because you don't agree with him can make it all too hard.  I never had that kind of negative experience with him.  But he also was honest and ""to the point"" about the process at each stage, which might seem uncaring to some women.  I am not the kind of person who pushes hard to get my way, and I think that had a positive effect on my interactions with him.  I do not know if that aspect of my personality may have hurt my chances, such as when I only had 2 follicles with my IVF cycle (at a high level of hormone treatments) and he said we needed to convert the cycle to IUI.  I now feel pretty confident he made the right call.  First consult he was kind, encouraging and listened.  He explained everything and made a plan that workedfor me. On important appointments, for sonos and pregnancy tests he was present.  Always asked how I was doing and made the visit very personal.  He was genuinely happy for me when we got the positive results. I chose Dr. Licciardi based on the very thorough way he explains everything and his detailed approach. He may be more ""scientific"" than some patients prefer it I knew I was in good hands. The nurses in the practice are very hands on and knowledgeable.She is a guru in the field and has special expertise around protecting women like myself who are also undergoing treatment for breast cancer.  It was disappointing to me that I only saw Dr. Noyes though at the initial consultation and then at the egg retrievals.Our initial meeting with her lasted almost an hour.  She spent a lot of time asking me questions about myself, family, job, education, social life etc. She really wanted to know who should could be working with. She made me feel like I was doing the right thing, and that I was light years ahead of my counterparts. It was obvious from this meeting that Dr. Noyes's compassion and bedside manner matched my needs.
Once my cycles started I did not see Dr. Noyes very often. I saw her an average of 2 times per cycle, and Dr. Noyes did not do either of my two retrievals. I saw Dr. Noyes a long time ago -- 1999-2000.  I was 42 years old and had failed a number of IUI and IVC rounds with injectable hormones, as well as two previous donor egg attempts at a different clinic.  Dr. Noyes was straightforward, candid, warm but a bit brisk (I am OK with that), and made it clear that she would give you as much or as little detail as you wanted.  She told me at the first visit that she thought she could get me pregnant ""one way or another,"" and she did. She originally planned to go straight to a donor egg cycle, but while waiting for a donor I unexpectedly got pregnant the old fashioned way (courtesy of my husband) for about ten minutes, until I had an early miscarriage. Still, that was enough evidence to prompt Dr. Noyes to suggest one more cycle using my own eggs.  We tried that, but it did not work.  Next, a donor became available and we had a long talk about how many embryos to implant.  I wanted to be aggressive, in light of my age and history.  Dr. Noyes eventually agreed to 4, with all kinds of contingency plans if I ended up with too many.  As it turned out, one took.  Dr. Noyes discharged me from the fertility clinic at 3 months but sent a lovely note when  my first daughter was born.  Somewhat amazingly, I got pregnant again -- also the old-fashioned way -- when daughter #1 was 6 months old.  Even though Dr. Noyes had nothing  to do with that (except, perhaps, in the karmic sphere) and she sent another lovely note when my second daughter was born.   Both girls are now in high school.Dr. Maxwell is easy to talk to, involves you in the treatment plan, and is on the conservative side, which I like. She gave me the pros and cons of doing IVF immediately, but also gave me the reasons for trying IUI first. She gave me her recommendations but also the choice to do what I felt was right for me and my husband. Dr. Grifo is a truly caring doctor, and it is clear how much pride he takes in being able to help so many couples conceive. He's one of the pioneers of IVF in the U.S. and his expertise is apparent. He has a very warm bedside manner, while remaining candid in his explanations. Dr. Goldman should have told me more about the painful procedure to diagnose a polyp and what it entailed given my sexual abuse history. She also should have told me about the egg donor option given that my time for egg retrieval was limited due to cancer treatment. Finally, I lost four eggs due to attrition because she did not time the retrieval properly.During the consultation Dr. Licciardi was very personable and thorough in reviewing the IUI and IVf statistics with my husband and I. He was available following my unsuccessful cycles for any questions or concerns I have. Warm bedside manner. Takes her time during initial consultation. Difficult to get a hold of in between visits. No guarantees you would see her for follow-up visits due to the structure of the clinic which involves seeing any IVF doctor who is doing monitoring or procedures on the day you  need to come in.I think Dr. Fino is very kind and explains all of your options well.  However, in my 9 months of treatment, I only saw her twice.  She does seem very busy nonetheless so your time with her is limited.She's the right doctor for me. She's just the right mix of facts and optimism. I didn't see her often, though, and sometimes I didn't know what the next step in the process was. (Though in her defense things didn't go according to plan).  Dr Fino is knowledgable and kind.  She is realistic but also supportive and encouraging during a time that can feel hopeless and frustrating.  She wants what's best for you and you can feel that she is completely behind you.  He's extremely knowledgeable. He's honest. He always told me all the pros and cons to each option and there was never any pressure. He pretty much lets you decide how you want to go. And he has an excellent personal manner. I definitely would recommend him to a friend.Dr. Berkeley was easy to talk to and very knowledgable. He rattles off a million statistics and can tell you your chances of getting pregnant based on x, y and z. We saw him three times. The initial consultation, the second consultation when IUI didn't work, and lastly when I was pregnant. I found him compassionate, trustworthy and would highly recommend. She is smart, and tells it like it is. I appreciated her sense of humor. I didn't ask alot of questions, because I didn't feel the need to. I'm not a doctor, but I am smart, and I trusted her expertise.  If you are older, she indicates that will work against you. She did follow up with me. Dr Berkeley seems very competent, however the clinic takes a conservative approach towards trying IVF.  We likely wasted 4 months waiting for better FSH results.  When we got a 2nd opinion, at age 42, it really made sense to try IVF as soon as possible.  Thus, one might conclude they are interested in keeping their statistics up; on the side, they may be acting ethically in not performing expensive IVF procedures when success is unlikely.He is very hard to reach and you barely ever see him. Having said that, his assistants are incredibly responsive. During our first consultation I felt he had all the time in the works for us and was going to do all he could. He also responded to us on an emotional level in a way that deeply resonated with me - something our previous doctor could not do. Dr. Keefe is a caring, knowledgable doctor who thoroughly explains the available procedures, explains the data clearly and is careful with the patients' emotions. We've always felt we were receiving the best care with him.Dr. Berkeley always listened to everything we had to say and answered all our questions. He was up to date with our file and honest with what we should or shouldn't do when we brought something up on our own. He was clear with our next steps and always treated us kindly and we never felt rushed.He was patient and explained everything in a way that I could understand. I never felt like a number or a statistic. He was knowledgeable and compassionate. He called me during the cycles and afterwards to discuss next steps or to congratulate when cycle took. Dr. Goldman knew all the details of our file/case. She had confidence in our ability to become pregnant, she was always positive and looking for new methods or tweaks to our plan. She performed almost all of my treatments, including surgery for an ectopic pregnancy. I thought Kara Goldman did a great job.  she was forth coming and explained everything in full detail.  she would explains things multiple times if needed.  she always seemed to care about her job and the patient.  Dr. Licciardi was recommended to us by my OB/GYN. He was very sympathetic to our specific challenges, and at first I felt in great hands. But after many months of poor results, I never felt like he went above and beyond for us, or was willing to try new, different, or outside-of-the-box ideas/treatments. She is very knowledgeable, adjusted my treatments when one is not working, and honest with the results and prognosis. When I got results that I didn't want to see, she is compassionate, warm and has suggestions for the next round.Dr Alan is very knowledgeable and he does try to get as much of your background history as possible. He does follow up on you if you call or if you have a question. 
I would say the weakness is that he follows a protocol and doesn't feel that he ajusts the same to the patience needsDr. Grifo provided excellent care and clearly made us aware of the process and managed expectations appropriately.  He made himself available for phone consultations during each step of the process.  Dr. Grifo is a very knowledgeable doctor.  My experience overall with NYU was positive, as far as it went.  The process itself was straightforward.  However, it was unclear at the end of it whether I had enough eggs to be a true insurance policy.  Additionally the hormone dose used was higher than at other clinics, where my results were similar.  Grifo is a straight-forward communicator, meeting with my husband and I a few times to talk about options and setting up a treatment plan. I felt he was doing evidence-based (rather than anecdote-based) medicine, and I got great results. Dr. Grifo is a highly professional, honest and caring doctor, who doesn't try to 'sell' you on any fertility services. In the several meetings I have had with him, he has always been very frank yet warm, ready to share with us data from his years of research and work, and also understand how that understanding should be applied to us.First impression was great. My husband and I felt comfortable within a few minutes of meeting dr Licciardi. He clearly explained all of our options and helped us every step along the way. He was always available to speak with and answer questions, concerns etc... 
Dr Hodes was completely candid from the get go but very confident of a positive outcome.  She did everything necessary to prepare me for transfer and adjusted the course if things weren't working, always communicating why and what she was trying to achieve.  I felt like I was her only patient!I found her to be extremely competent and realistic. She also had my best interests at heart and was very ""real"" about how to proceed. I didn't have many choices because of my situation- but she was very optimistic about my course and everything turned out positive for me. I was very lucky!He spoke Portuguese, as do I so it helped that we had something in common . What I loved the most is that he described very complicated things in a basic way so that i would understand. Instead of a patient, he made me feel like a WARRIOR! See previous feedbackHe was very personable and always was around to schedule a call if we had questions.  I do think it's important to always read up and be on top of your own care. My thyroid kept spiking and I felt I needed to be on top of it bec no one else was.  This may or may not have contributed to infertility as it wasn't that high (3-4 max), but I had read that fertility doctors did need to see it below 2.5 in order for treatment to be effective.  So that's my only complaint... But I truly think he is the best. We got the results we wanted and were always treated compassionately.  I had had a previous bad experience with an HST test and he redid it in a much better way and made me feel like it was the other doctor's fault and not mine.  At a time when I felt very vulnerable that my body wasn't doing what it was supposed to do, he never made me feel like it was my fault and he always made me feel like we had options.Strengths: he was real and honest and encouraged us to 'stir the pot' with the donor eggs which we really liked.  He showed us pictures of his IVF children and made us feel comfortable with the procedures.  Weakness:  he was speaking at an event the day of my embryo transfer so he didn't perform the day of the big event, which made me upset.  However, like the entire process, I just went with the flow and now have two beautiful and healthy twin girls who I love and adore with all my heart.Very friendly and informative. He told me a lot about himself and his history. You can ask him questions but he will end the meeting after a few. He always run late and always has a student with him for training purposes. He doesn't offer much advice jn terms of things to do to help the process - vitamins, diet, exercise, etc. which would be more helpful. He is very honest and professional while still being compassionate and sensitive to outside factors. He is accessible and very willing to work as part of an integrated treatment team. He is a good communicator. Dr Grifo answers questions, but the process feels disorganized and providers write things illegibly on pieces of paper which both feels disorganized and ineffective.  Why don't they prepare material and customize it as needed.I would have liked to have more communication with her, but overall the experience was good. She is right in the middle when it comes to giving information in a soft manner vs. a cold manner. We communicated the most when I was deciding to do IVF.Dr. Noyes is a skilled and experienced clinician. I have personally had only good experiences as her patient. I have referred several other people to her and they did not have as positive experiences as I did.Dr. Grifo is extremely patient and compassionate.He is also extremely knowledgeable and I highly recommend him. He is willing to take risks when necessary and was able to retrieve the most eggs. He is on top of all the most updated studies in the field and i trust his judgement completely. The only concern is that he is not there at every appointment and did not do the retrieval, but he is at the ones that matter. She didnt recommend testing other than hormone blood work and ultrasound and pushed me to begin medication. In retrospect she should have recommended a HSG, male factor testing, immune factor testing, Prometrium challenge, etc. For our only cycle with Dr Berkeley, we used a combination of frozen eggs and fresh eggs, however all of our frozen eggs did not survive the thaw which is very very rare.  We do not feel it was handled properly.She is extremely straight forward and was confident that her team would do what needed to get done to get the results we were looking for. After a couple years of trying, I was very skeptical of a new fertility doctor but she gave me an assurance when others would not. She looked me square in the face after I sat in her office sobbing that she would get me pregnant. And I believed her and 4 months later she did. Dr Berkeley was straightforward and didn't sugar coat anything. I really liked that, because I felt I was in the hands of a professional. My husband was really impressed by his down to earth attitude and the fact that the doctor didn't try to sell us onto anything. He was not pushy, it took husband and I 10 months to go ahead with our treatment.Dr Hodes-Wertz was very straight forward and even felt like she was pushing us towards IVF before we were ready to go there. It look a while for her to feel warm to me but after a few miscarriages and tests it did feel like we were on the same team and she was truly compassionate towards our journey. She was very informative, straight forward and had great bed side manner I like and trust Dr Noyes but wish we had more one on one interaction. I only saw her in person for my intake appt before my first IUI and after two cancelled IVF cycles. All my communication was with the nurses and other Dr's who did my ultrasounds.He was upfront, friendly, asked questions and listened.  He was very pessimistic about my treatment and personally called me to recommend aborting the cycle half way through because of the low number of eggs. He however did not offer any alternative, so I proceeded with the cycle and became pregnant with only two eggs retrieved. The reception staff was terrible! I can't even pretend that they weren't. However, all of the nurses and finance people were amazing!Dr FIno was very engaging and I know she wanted to see us with a pregnancy. We never changed up our approach towards pregnancy. I would have liked for her to have offered more aggressive treatment or solutions to our recurring losses.Very competent doctor. Bedside manner is not his strong point and it was hard to get access to him to actually speak to him, but he's very good at explaining the procedures and he knows what he's doing. This is not the place to go if you're looking for emotional support, but a place to go if you just care about the results.Dr. Licciardi was great - very personable and put us at ease immediately. We never felt rushed or pressured to do anything and we began treatments even after declining some recommended testing (HSG). Dr. Licciardi returned phone calls personally and when we were getting impatient and wanted to explore adding medication to our IUIs he suggested another round of natural before going that route and that's the cycle I got pregnant. We now have a two year old and are starting the process again with Dr. Licciardi for baby number two. Great doctor. Felt extremely comfortable with him and felt like I was well taken care of even though I didn't receive the results I wanted from himDr. Noyes enabled us to have our family, so she will always hold a very special place in my heart. We did get to know her perhaps a little more personally than most patients, which just made my husband and I respect her even more. I really can't say enough good things about Dr. Noyes. After our very long tenure at NYU, I missed her.Dr. Fino was very nice, took a lot of time with us listening. Seemed very intelligent and knowledgeable. Gave us all our options.Dr. Grifo is knowledgable, straight forward, reliable and honest. He adjusted treatments in response to results. He and the other physicians in the group were well coordinated, so I never felt as if there was a lapse in care if he was out of the office on the day of my visit.  Dr. Licciardi is a great mix of blunt and delicate. He really takes the time to get to know you. He has been very helpful through the process.  His nurses are also wonderful. We're not done yet but we plan to continue with him.  She came recommended by friends and I would certainly recommend her - she's professional and treats patients accordingly. She was available when needed and her staff are great also. she explained things well in a very confusing field.He is warm and relatable, making me feel comfortable while remaining professional. I trusted him implicitly and am so glad we did. I only actually met with him once or twice - his team is amazing Although, he is not super warm and fuzzy, I have a beautiful 2 year old and am 20 months pregnant with my second.  I appreciated his matter of fact style and is incredibly smart.  I trust his judgement and would recommend! very kind, good bedside manner. thorough with her details. I really liked him and was very knowledgeable. He followed up when the IUI wasn't working and did further testing to find out if I wasn't having a problem.  Since I was okay we moved into IVF.  The first time was successfulShe was very sweet and caring. When I had a miscarriage, she called to find out how I was feeling. She was very responsive when I reached out to her and very excited with my positive pregnancy test. Dr. Grifo was an absolute genius in his field. Not only was he brilliant and ready to make changes so that I could achieve the best possible results, he was also kind, compassionate and caring. He knew how nervous I was and always made sure to calm me down and be the positivity that I needed. I would talk with dr Fino but someone else would perform the surgery. That left me feeling a bit concerned. She was very thorough and had me do several exams and screenings to ensure that I had optimal conditions for conceptionGreat patient care, vet knowledgeable, and personable. Good flexibility in connecting through the phone as opposed to only through office visits. Vet patient and personable. But I am still in the middle of the process at this time 
Dr. DeVore always heard me out and listened to my thoughts/feelings/questions. It was a very collaborative experience. She checked in on me frequently during my treatment and made sure to ask me about life outside of fertility. She was thoughtful, supportive, and down to earth. I feel so grateful to have found her.Dr. DeVore was exactly what I was looking for in a fertility doctor. She always took the time to explain everything to me. She was honest but compassionate when there was not so good news, and she always had a plan for the next step, which I appreciated. She was able to get me pregnant on my third round of IUI, but we had already set up the process for IVF in case the IUI didn't work. I'm so grateful to her for getting me pregnant, but also for her knowledge and approachable bedside manner.We really like Dr. Berkeley (he's knowledgeable, and has a great bedside manner) but the staff at NYU is a disaster. Before every appointment we had to check into billing before being seen. We felt as if we were treated like cattle at every appointment.Dr Keefe has an excellent consultative demeanor. He is careful with how he communicates with my wife, sometimes explaining things in several different ways to make sure we both understand what is going on. He takes as long as needed to be sure we understand our options, the pros/cons and are comfortable making our decisions.The office was never overcrowded and we were always seen on time. Dr. Berekeley and his staff always took a lot of time with us to explain everything, to let us discuss all our issues and answer all our questions. We were never rushed and often spent an hour just talking to him.She is a kind doctor who doesn't sugar coat anything but is sensitive enough to treat you wellHe was nice and friendly. I only saw him twice through the entire cycle though and had him once on the phone. Dr. Keefe is warm, takes time to establish bedside manner and tells great and relevant anecdotes.Dr. Shannon DeVore made me feel so comfortable throughout the process. I always felt like she listened to me and understood my personal needs. Her recommendations were specific to my personal medical situation as well as my needs and life. She was caring and compassionate every step of the way. She took the time needed to answer all my questions and never rushed through. And, she was extremely thorough with her answers. I wanted to understand EVERY step of the process, every risk, and every potential scenario. Shannon was so patient and not only answered my questions immediately, but also gave me the level of depth that I needed so that I felt fully comfortable. I cannot tell you how much I appreciated Dr. DeVore's care, dedication and personal attention! Nurses know my name, as does Dr. Grifo, all are patient, kind, attentive and in tune with my particular case. Dr. Keefe is extremely empathetic and passionate about what he does. He takes the time to make sure you're comfortable with the information.I, personally, am not very sensitive or sentimental about my infertility and don't expect (and actually dislike) compassion or pity from a medical staff. I like to overcome difficulties with a sense of humor and stay realistic and optimistic. Dr. Wertz is blunt, she provides accurate information and explains things clearly, giving me options to choose. I like that. It was very difficult to get a hold of Dr. Hodes. Most often, I would get a call from one of the nurses instead. Due to the number of patients they deal with it's very hard to find time.Dr. grifo was extremely compassionate when we experienced a loss due to ectopic pregnancy as a result of a round of IUI. He was always available if we needed to talk. 

The office itself is run like a very well oiled machine. Morning monitoring makes you feel like a number - but at the same time I am thankful they are efficient and I am in and out of there in the mornings before work. I appreciate how Dr Licciardi was blunt, straightforward and I liked his bedside manner. One time during treatment he called me at home to see how I was doing. But I only saw him once in person apart from the initial consultation (he just happened to be attending one day during monitoring), and I felt like I got conflicting information and levels of care from different doctors and fellows over the course of each cycle. Once I began treatment, it was as though he completely checked out. None of my doses were adjusted even though I was not responding and he wasn’t reachable when a nurse called me to cancel my cycle right before retrieval day.We talked about common interests beyond having babies - like skiing. For me this is important - it's like a sales call, let's talk about something for a minute or two that isn't this crazy expensive stressful situation that we are really here to discuss. Dr Berkeley and the team at NYU were efficient and professional. From the nurses I met with for monitoring, to the embryologist I met on the day of my FET, everyone was kind and answered all of my questions. I felt like I could trust the team at NYU and that I was in good hands.Dr. Licciardi was my doctor but I saw him only twice during the process. We met at the consult and then he preformed one ultrasound. I was surprised when I learned he wasn't the one conducting my retrieval but he called me and put me at ease about who was doing the retrieval. All of the doctors are highly skilled with decades of experience so you will always be in great hands. I really thought Dr. Licciardi's care was excellent during the process. He was always accessible by phone and email, and he called me several times to keep me updated and to check on me. I definitely felt that he cared and I wasn't just another number in the factory.Dr Grifo appeared genuinely invested in our success and showed sympathy when things did not work out time after time. He would spend as much time on the phone as we needed, answering questions, suggesting further tests, providing condolences, etc.Dr. Grifo was very encouraging throughout our process. He was mindful of both the emotional and physical demand of IVF. He was sure to communicate how none of this was our fault, talked us through each step of the process, and reassured us when things didn't go as planned. While most of my time was spent with the nursing staff, I felt that Dr. Hodes made time to answer all of my questions -- including setting up a second consultation to make sure I was totally comfortable while deciding between IUI and IVF. Dr Licciardi spent a good deal of time with us during our consultation and he was blunt yet always very positive. He also listened to my ideas and we came up with a plan together. He didn’t push me right into IVF and encouraged my break between IUIs and IVF. He also called to follow up with me after failed IUIs and is quick to answer any questions I have over email, which is super convenient. Dr. Grifo has a call with me each step of the way, good or bad, to explain what is going on, to answer questions, to discuss next steps and create a plan of action. He uses his own personal experiences to relate to you, and shows empathy and compassionIt's a little of both at NYU. They have A LOT of patients and a very well-run and well-organized system. I can see how people would easily feel like a number but the staff is so friendly and caring and compassionate that I always personally felt like a human, even if I was just one of many women getting shuffled through the morning monitoring process. They always had a smile and asked how I was doing. Dr. Fino was excellent clinically and had a compassionate bedside manner. She was warm and friendly and answered all my questions patiently. In person the conversations were frank and direct. 
Upon failure of the procedure my husband and I asked to revisit what went wrong / what could be done differently.   During that visit it felt like he was reviewing the details for the very first time and hadn't prepared for the discussion - like the center was indeed a factory without much tailoring or specific patient focus or analysis.Dr. Fino's bedside manner is lukewarm and she's pretty much, in and out. She exhibits no real compassion and, I feel as though, she is money hungry.Dr. Hodes treated me like a human and also like a friend.  She shared personal information that was relatable and helped me feel comfortable under her care.  There are two offices and several doctors but she always made it convenient for me to see her when important. She called me back when I had questions and spent extra time explaining things as needed.  I felt so comfortable working with Dr.Hodes and will miss being under her care.The entire process of IVF has to be somewhat assembly line like or it would never work with the amount of patients. NYU made me feel like a person to the best of their ability. The west side is a smaller office. Dr. Hodes secretary always answered my emails in a timely fashion. She knew who I was everytime I walked in. All the of the nurses I dealt with were genuially happy to see my cycle progressing well. During the 3 cycles, only once was the treatment adjusted when i had poor response to the fertility drugs.  i showed better results then.  Not further tests were done to understand if there was another condition other than the obvious factor of age.  Later, found by another doctor on the first visit, it was discovered i had a benign tumor on the pituitary gland that was causing lots of issues.  this was discovered by simply checking my prolactin levels.  I am told by other doctors this should have been checked.The NYU offices are very busy. I have met Dr. Keefe once with my partner and never saw him again. Nurse Carol has been my primary contact and caregiver. After 3 clomid treatments and 2 IUIs , we have not been successful yet. Dr. Goldman is thoughtful and professional, honest and warm. This business is all a mixed bag: good numbers, science mingling with miracles, data on donors, genetic testing, but through it all Dr. Goldman and her team speak to me and my life and my choices as if I am their only patient. You feel like a human when you are seen by the team of doctors and nurses, but once you need a follow up call with one of the doctors or nurses, the answering system is efficient, but does make you feel like just another number. They will call you back, but it's often someone you've never spoken to before. Also, sitting in a packed waiting room and having your name called among other 10 names, definitely feels like a manufacturing plant scale... The 1:1 interactions are great (with with exception of billing), but everything else around it is of inhumane scale.We first tried a different fertility clinic which we promptly left before the first cycle commenced as we felt this office was not really on top of things.  After this experience, we decided to go to NYU and work with Dr. Berkeley after another friend gave us a good recommendation of him. Immediately upon meeting him, I sensed he had the wisdom of a highly skilled scientist, but the warmth of a family member.  Dr. Berkeley takes a considerable amount of time with his patients to get to know them, and thoroughly explain not only what he thinks is going on case by case, but his strategies for resolving the issues.  He is also a very straight shooter - and by this I do not mean he is brutal with his honesty.  He simply explains odds in a realistic yet comforting manner.  Although we had two failed cycles, we feel very happy under Dr. Berkeley's care and will soon be undergoing  a donor egg cycle as our main issue is diminished ovarian reserve.  I am so grateful to have found Dr. Berkeley and to be under his care.  I feel like a number because she doesn't call me to check in and see how I'm doing.  She's very quick and always feels like she's in a hurry during appointments. A few aspects of my specific situation (which also then changed from first visit in 2015 to 2017/18)  made the decision to try IVF a personal challenge to work through. She actively and patiently listened to me with each visit over the several year period before deciding to try it. Without trying to sway me either way, she offered her honest input - both the statistics/facts but also (and more importantly) her experience and observations as someone who has worked with many women though this decision and process.I'm undergoing treatments as a single mother by choice. From the beginning Dr. Noyes has shared personal anecdotes and resource suggestions that support and validate this path. She's been candid about my treatment options and built a plan that is well-suited to my situation and personal desires to ""get this done as quickly as possible."" She takes the time to listen to me and always answers my full list of questions. When I miscarried, she was sympathetic, but remains positive about the likelihood of me successfully carrying to term in the future. Additionally, her assistant Alyssa is a pleasure to work with and helps me squeeze into see her or speak with her when I have questions. I have never felt like a number or like I was on a conveyor belt at her practice. I don't say it's her fault. But Because of big fertility center like NYU, I didn't feel connected with doctor. She pretty much gives you straightforward answer. There is no hesitation.   NYU is a large fertility clinic and well oiled machine.  At first I felt like a number until I learned how to operate within the system.  It's difficult to have direct access to your Doctor, which is understandable given the volume of patients they say day in and day out.  However, any time I leave messages with Dr. Fino's assistant for Dr. Fino I get an immediate response.  They went above and beyond for me several times.  Dr. Masbou who is a fellow that works with Dr. Fino is super responsive and accessible by email as well.  The staff at NYU has come to feel like family and they are very responsive and well organized.  Dr Fino, Nurse Mary and the entire staff at NYU are fantastic. When you speak with them, you feel like you're the only patient in the world. That being said, NYU is a machine and the volume of people entrusting their fertility services can be overwhelming. In more boutique centers we visited, you can easily call or email your doctor. At NYU, you can hopefully schedule a call with them within a week.  Dr Hodes-Wertz knows how to balance giving blunt diagnosis with warm bedside manner. She has never rushed me and has always spent time to listen to my concerns. I did not feel judged for any of my questions. Dr. Hodes-Wertz is both professional, talented, confident in her practice and kind.She was great. Patient, realistic and always professionaDr. Griffo barely reviewed my file before meeting with me. He and his staff talked about numbers and procedures like I was a machine. I have met with other doctors, this was my worst experience. It is a smaller clinic less doctors.  The nurses really care and return phone calls/ and emails Promptly Dr. Licciardi was great about calling me back when I requested a phone call, but he didn't always seem to know who I was or where I was or in what kind of cycle. As a result, I think I was addressing one concern while he was talking about something else, that I didn't even know related to me. When we had actual appointments, he was attentive at those times. Once, I ran into him on my way out after an IUI under his care/protocol, and he didn't wish me good luck or even smile; I thought this was a little odd, but then realized he was probably very busy and/or preoccupied.I dealt mostly with the nurses and fellows.  Some of them were very nurturing, caring, and competent.  Others were less so.  Depends on who I got.

Dr. Berkeley is a very matter-of-fact, analytical doctor.  He gives you the straight answers and instill confidence in you that he's competent, experienced and knowledgeable.  That is the primary reason why we went with Dr. Berkeley for all of our IvF rounds.  His communication skills and bedside manners weren't always as consistent or strong.  But we knew that going into the journey not to expect any hand holding of any kind from Dr. Berkeley.She was very candid about her own personal life. She made me feel like she could relate to my plight of being a physician, busy, hard working and having not met the right man yet. She was very forthright about her own struggles as a female physician. I felt like she understood me and didn't judge me.The first thing Dr. Licciardi said to me at our initial consult was, ""it looks like you have been on a long road, and I know how difficult that is."" It was a simple acknowledgment but exactly what I needed to hear. His caring demeanor continued throughout our treatment. When he spoke with us, he explained his recommendations and patiently answered our many questions.The clinic welcomes a lot of patients per day and, while everyone is friendly, they don't have time to get personal. The nurses are your primary interlocutors so they do know you better and they do their best to listen to your worries but sometimes it felt like they did not have the time nor the energy to sooth your worries and anxieties.Dr. Grifo was always kind and compassionate with every conversation. I only met with him in person once, but he was always available for a conference call with my husband and I and we never felt rushed when on the call. I felt like he really understood how tough this process is and how much of an emotional roller-coaster it can be. From the initial visit, it was clear Dr. Grifo was different. He was so personal and personable. He humanized this entire, gut-wrenching process of IVF. While being very data driven and showing us statistics regarding success rates at my age and ovarian reserve level, Dr. Grifo also said I was heroic for undergoing such procedures and to stop blaming myself. He shared his personal story of infertility and feelings of helplessness and failure; can you even imagine a pioneer of IVF feeling like this, let alone admitting it? He made me and my husband feel hopeful, but again he utilized data to explain his beliefs and confidence. During the process, my meds were customized and monitored daily (this was certainly not the case at the prior clinic where we went through three, unsuccessful egg retrievals. The nurses were supremely confident, down to earth and competent. Furthermore, I felt like they were rooting for me and knew me. The Dr who performed the transfer (not Grifo) was incredible; she was realistic, yet optimistic and spoke to me like a real human (not just #7 transfer today).I was seen in 2 different offices.  The smaller west side office on W 52nd Street was wonderful. The team is small and very friendly. When I called or came in to the office they knew exactly who I was.  I also had to go to the main NYU Fertility center on 1st Ave for blood work and ultrasounds.  At the main facility I was just a number.  They are incredibly efficient and move people through quickly, but it means that each time I saw different people and to them I was just a name on a piece of paper.When I actually talked to Dr.Fino she was great on the phone and respected my approach to getting pregnant. That said it was difficult to reach her, the phone system sucked, it took me weeks to schedule a phone appointment. And it felt like a system that was not humanly compassionate.When I spoke directly with Doctor Fino (after my first cycle ended and I received my PGS results), I found her to be helpful, understanding and willing to go into as much detail as I needed.  I felt more like a number during the cycle itself, going into the clinic and seeing a different doctor each time and receiving a call from a different nurse each time.  I found it difficult to get in touch with Doctor Fino without scheduling a call a week out.When my husband and I met with Dr. Grifo, we had been trying to conceive for over 2 years. We had had several miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies, and failed FETs. We were completely heartbroken and full of despair. Dr. Grifo was immediately empathetic, but realistic. He does not have the ""God"" complex that I found other IVF doctors had. He is incredibly knowledgeable and compassionate. HIs staff was very professional as well. Dr. Hodes had to delivery very bad news to me, but she did so in the kindest, most professional manner.  Despite the bad news and possibly poor prognosis, she came up with a treatment plan that accounted for my unique circumstances.  Throughout the course of my treatment, Dr. Hodes continued to communicate with me throughout the course of my treatment.  After our first IVF cycle failed, she took the time to speak with us about what happened and how we would adjust our plan for the next cycle.  I felt like she truly cared about me as a person.Dr. Licciardi treated us like humans, but we only met with him once and only spoke on the phone a few times regarding results after that. The clinic treats you a little like a number – which was to be expected at a large clinic like that, so it did not bother me.I knew from the moment I called to make my first appointment that I would like the practice. They were thorough and helpful and remembered me (and my multiple phone calls) when I came in. I was very lucky and had a successful egg cycle and transfer.  Dr Noyes was on target, predicting that she would be able to get over 20 eggs in a cycle and they retrieved 27 eggs.  She was very practical and helpful in determining how to proceed when I decided to conceive.  She is a good diagnostician.  She is also blunt, funny and a little wacky.  But if you are struggling and need a bit of hand hand holding,  I am not sure Dr. Noyes is the doctor for you. Some days it was like a factory in there. Unless you had the same nurse drawing your blood each morning or saw the same doctor every morning you were a number. It wasn't until I had complications with the IVF that I became a humanBoth my wife and I had been through a cycle before that was unsuccessful.  Dr. Berkley was able to answer questions that were difficult ones to answer with a sense of care, compassion and knowledge like he has been down this road before and knows what to expect.Dr Grifo was empathic and kind in his bedside manner and approach. He was available to speak to us when necessary, happened to be the attending when we had our retrieval and made himself available to us to do our transfer. Dr. Fino takes the time to really explain things and spoke to me like I was an intelligent grown-up. I felt like a partner in my own treatment. She was also open to considering ideas I had researched myself, which was wonderful.The billing department was extremely transparent and professional.
The nursing team was extremely kind and available for questions and follow-up when needed.
The office was very well organized and I never felt forgotten or overlooked.
My doctor was kind and caring, took his time during examinations and consultations and was always available for questions. He was honest and practical, and did not push more serious interventions before I was ready for them.I was impressed with efficiency and attention to detail from all the staff, superb communication between every level of care, Doctors, Nurse, Secretarial staff. My issues were always addressed very promptly, everyone placed a great afford to make me feel that I was taken care of. All staff was unbelievablely helpful and supportive. Unfortunately, I expected much better outcomes - (more eggs to be retrieved) All the labs looked great, however it turned out that many of the follicles were empty/or filled with fluid instead of mature eggs.  Besides the costly price, I would definately use same facility.  NYU's clinic is crowded.  I met Dr. Berkeley at my consult when he ""became"" my doctor.  But I never saw him again or heard from him again throughout my cycle.NYU unfortunately has an enormous amount of patients. So there were so many of us that I felt we were just another patient, esspecially trying to make apts, calling the facility or coming in for monitoring. But when we were able to see or speak to the dr we felt like humans because dr Berkley took the time to go through all the details with us in person and also over the phone. He made us feel like we were his top priority. He Didn't rush us, he repeated things if we didn't understand. He joked with us so that felt very personable. Dr Grifo is a nice guy but VERY blunt. I am a journalist so I appreciated that candor. He is very statistical in his analysis and doesn't mince words. I was 38 about to turn 39 and he was really honest with me that I might not get great results. To my delight, I got 19 perfect eggs, and a 20th that was a little premature. Even he was a little surprised I think. I will say that when he called me to go over the results, he was way more optimistic and said 20 was a terrific number. That was great. The guy is just honest, but I know some women don't like that approach. Dr. Licciardi found the right balance of understanding/sympathy and honesty when I was unsuccessful and couldn't help but cry.  He also gave me a chance at IVF with my own eggs after honestly telling me that he would not recommend it, and he had a positive attitude throughout the process.  Finally, the nurse staff were very supportive of me during the various processes I went through.He was always there for sonos. Very kind and encouraging. Long initial consultation, he let me chose when to start treatment and what course to followDr. Noyes took a lengthy amount of time with me at my initial consultation.  She explained things very clearly and took time with me as I was overwhelmed by the whole process.Dr. Noyes treated me like a human being.  Sometimes I felt like a bit of a number while waiting to see her and while interacting with others at NYU.  it is a big place.Dr. Maxwell was attentive and reassuring during our first consultation. She listened to all of my concerns and has been responsive to phone calls. I feel like she has my best interests at heart when determining my treatment plan. Her nurses are also super knowledgeable and helpful. Dr. Grifo took the time to sit with me and my husband, and explain every part of this process. In every interaction I've had with him, I've never felt like he was rushing me or seeing me as just another number. Dr. Goldman did not call after my second retrieval to inform me or explain why 6 of the eggs were not retrieved. She also did not provide me with all relevant information during either of my two cycles. Finally, I underwent a painful procedure because she misdiagnosed a polyp. She did not tell me the procedure would be painful nor did she tell me risk of misdiagnosisDr. Licciardi contacted me following both failed IUI’s. He follows up to check in to see how I am feeling following the failed attempt. Dr Fino is wonderful and has great bedside manner and explains things very clearly. She made me very comfortable, and I planned to continue to work with her. However, I found the office itself to be very impersonal, difficult to connect with the same person, difficult to navigate with long hold times and often having to talk to the answering service. I also found the group orientation very impersonal and also not as private as I would like which is why I switched clinics.Dr. Fino is very nice and has good bedside manner.She's very straight forward. My situation wasn't great but she wasn't overly apologetic about it - she told me the facts and gave me a plan. It helped keep me hopeful and not focused on my bad stats. Dr Fino is kind and compassionate, she has been very reassuring throughout the entire process.  She is very smart and good at explaining the medical information so we could understand.  She did not rush us in our initial meeting.  We had an interesting scenario where we were forced into fertility preservation because of a newly diagnosed cancer, on top of our infertility struggle.Dr. Grifo is very nice. He was always very pleasant and personable. He is a very caring physican. It's hard not to feel like you are in a fertility factor with the sheer number of patients present and the efficiency you are seen with. I don't see this as a bad thing. Most of the nurses and doctors are warm. I had been seen once by one of the more prominent doctors there and months later running into me in the elevator he remembered who I was. Very impressive.  Had direct contact with her and discussed the treatment failures, she felt the disappointment I experienced as well. There was very little interaction after the 1st consultation.He is the most empathetic doctor I have ever had. During our first consultation, I felt he understood on a complex emotional level what we were going through and what we needed to hear (even if it was tough to say). I appreciated that Dr Licciardi took the time to explain everything to me and contact me throughout the cycle. The nurses at the clinic were exceptional and I couldn’t have asked for a better experience Dr. Goldman was knowledgeable, kind and always professional.  Kara Goldman had amazing bed side manor.  she would explain why things were happening, give us her professional opinion, and offer us our options.  she remembered who we were every time we came in and provided us with a safe environment. She is honest and compassionate. She returns calls or have her secretary call when busy.I felt that I was only one more woman trying to get pregnant. It almost felt like a factory, we all seam to be following the same treatments and schedule. I was never offered some kind of comfort by the nurses. The doctor was very to the point but a bit cold in my opinion. And has you know all woman that are passing thru a treatment have to be almost warriors not only physically but physiologically. Made himself accessible for individual phone consultations.  Emphasized us knowing about the option of genetic screening, which was important to us.   Dr. Grifo is incredibly knowledgeable and overall is a great doctor.  However, the time taken with me as a patient was higher at other clinics, as was the granularity of answers.  Grifo is one of very few doctors who doesn't talk down to his patients, but instead equips them with the information they need to decide on a course of action. I really appreciate that! I suspect this is partly because he is *not* insecure and because he is well-informed (partly due to undertaking research himself).Dr Licciardi is amazing!  He was always available to answer any questions, concerns etc.  All of the drs and nurses I met in the practice were kind and caring.  It's easy to become just a number, but the staff makes sure you don't feel that way.
Every step of the way and even now that I am under the care of an OB, Dr Hodes and her nurse Natalie continue to support me.  They are are excited as we are at the outcome of our procedure and we always available during treatments and treated us with great respect and honesty.He always called me by my first nameI was at Cornell for close to a year with horrible results....felt like a cattle call each morning for monitoring and you never saw the same doctor...it was like starting over each time. When we finally switched to NYU and Dr Berkeley the experience couldn't have been more different. Nurses were so nice and friendly, they remembered your name, doctor was always available and they don't take thousands of patients so the waiting room isn't a zoo. I could always see dr berkley what I needed to and he always promptly returned my calls. I am a fi believer that the positive experience and feeling I had under NYU's care was the differences! I had 4 failed cycles with no answers at Cornell and one cycle later at NYU a beautiful daughter with 9 frozen embryos....resulting in my now 6 month old. Success on both tries with Dr Berkeley!! The first meeting with him was very personal. He is a big shot doctor and was on the second to have a successful IVF transfer ever so it was nice to see that he was personal as well. He had his own history with infertility that helped him connect We were listened to and treated with respect - and it was obvious he loved helping people create families.  He shared things about his own life as well.  The entire practice was great.  While on the wait-list for a donor, they called me to tell me they typically don't refer patients to agencies, but one had several girls who fit my profile so we ended up using this agency.  Ended up 2 girls backed down - 1 2 weeks before she was set to come for the procedure.  It was emotional to say the least.  I called NYU and they talked us through options and put us at the top of the list since we were off it for about 6 months that we thought we had a donor.  The entire practice treated us very kindly and like we were humans throughout this emotional stage.He was very warm and sensitive to our complex situation while still being very honest about the risks. He has called me multiple times from his cell after hours to discuss our treatment plan.Office doesn't call back or follow-up in a timely manner. ... for scheduling and billing.  The actual visit feels personal, but the office logistics are impersonalIt was a very busy clinic and I liked the “in and out” aspect, but I can see how many patients would not. I also rarely saw Dr. FinoI have a long-standing relationship with Dr. Noyes and she treats me like an old friend. She has shown that she cares about me and my outcomes.Dr Grifo really gives you the time and attention and has a great demeanor, but it is tough to get an appointment and get him on the phone sometimes because he is so in-demand. I only saw her twice in 6 months - all monitoring appointments were done by nurses. The clinic is too big and you did not receive personal care.Dr. Noyes gave me assurance that she would do everything she could to get me pregnant as soon as possible. She could have had me go through 5 more IUs, but instead she understood my urgency and went straight for IVF. In my initial consultation we had a chat about my age, my husband's age, what that meant for my treatment, that I would need to go straight to donor eggs. I really appreciated his frankness.Dr Noyes has very practical and no nonsense approach. I felt we were on the same page about my treatment plan and the possible outcomes. Dr Fino was through and thoughtful and it always felt like she cared. It never felt like a show of interest. She was busy built always felt like she was there only for you.Nursing staff knew me by name, Dr Fino was very warm and personable. She made me felt heard and valued and was very caring during this difficult time. They certainly knew who we were and they were personable. But the clinic operates much like a factory without much emotion or personal care. It's very hard to just speak to the doctor.I was 26 and diagnosed with dor. Dr Licciardi diagnosed me with one look and after receiving results from my testing Dr Licciardi gave me his cell phone number and walked me through the entire process. He even took the time to console me after a failed cycle while he was in Hawaii with his family. Great doctor. The only reason I switch was for insurance purposesFrom our first meeting, Dr. Noyes made us feel like we were in this together and that she was confident that based on my previous cycles, she could get us pregnant. She is very honest and straightforward, something that we value very much.I definitely felt like I was treated as an individual. I understand how some people think it can feel like a factory when you are getting monitored and during the numerous appointments. But I would rather get in and out fast since I had to go some many times. Everyone was always nice and friendly and personable during my many many monitoring appointments. Dr. Fino was very nice and gentle and honest. He and his staff were personableHe took the time to meet my husband and I and really learn about us and our process.She is very friendly and has a caring manner - her nurses are excellentvery busy office, getting an appointment was very tough. I also had to call several times once I had a miscarriage to understand what I had to do next since Dr. Park was away. Staff was kind was in the office (nurses)-- but there was some confusion a few times in terms of what tests were needed and where they needed to happenSince I did not really meet with him much it took away for the personal touchHe always made me feel like I was important. It didn’t matter how busy he was, he made sure to answer all my questions and not rush my appointments. No follow up, had to call several times to move to next stage in process Great patient careDr. DeVore took the time to explain every detail of infertility with me, as well as every step along the way and exactly what the plan would be. ",8.0,8.199999999999994,"As a patient, I had an exceptional experience with Dr. DeVore and cannot recommend her highly enough. Dr. Wertz is direct and clear, she provides options and leaves it up to me to decide. I definitely felt that he cared and I wasn't just another number in the factory. Dr. Grifo is very straight forward with his communication. He also listened to me and my concerns while going through IUI and I felt that we came up with my fertility plan together, which helped make me feel more involved and in control. I would have appreciated her referring me to someone who knew how to properly manage and remove intramural fibroids; instead of performing procedures that put my uterus at risk for scaring. Doctor Brooke is warm and i believe a great physician but i think the NYU set up is not conducive to spending time with any of their patients. I can't really rate her as I was her patient because I hardly ever dealt with her at all- when I would finally be able to pin her down on the phone I had good clear candid conversations with her- I think she was clear and understood my perspective and honored that- but I did not get any sort of follow up from her and no human communication- even when I got pregnant- My interaction with her was limited other than determining a plan of action pre- and post-cycle. We found Dr. Licciardi to be smart, experienced and to the point. I ended up hospitalized with severe OHSS but was able to maintain a healthy pregnancy.... I saw Dr Liccardi when I first went to the clinic and spoke to him numerous times before my course of treatment. I do not know if that aspect of my personality may have hurt my chances, such as when I only had 2 follicles with my IVF cycle (at a high level of hormone treatments) and he said we needed to convert the cycle to IUI. Dr. Goldman should have told me more about the painful procedure to diagnose a polyp and what it entailed given my sexual abuse history. I had had a previous bad experience with an HST test and he redid it in a much better way and made me feel like it was the other doctor's fault and not mine. Seemed very intelligent and knowledgeable. I appreciated his matter of fact style and is incredibly smart. The nurses really care and return phone calls/ and emails Promptly Dr. Licciardi was great about calling me back when I requested a phone call, but he didn't always seem to know who I was or where I was or in what kind of cycle. The office was very well organized and I never felt forgotten or overlooked. She is very smart and good at explaining the medical information so we could understand. Dr. Fino was very nice and gentle and honest."
15,NYU Langone Fertility Center,advice,"Listen to his stories. They seem longwinded but are designed to reassure you as a patient. If you're going to see Dr. DeVore, you made the right choice! Best doctor at NYU Don't be overwhelmed by the size of the office or the staff.  He's not the doctor to see if you want personalized, individual attention from your doctor at every stage during the IVF process. I feel very confident with the level of care that I'm receiving and his oversight over my care, but there isn't much face time with Dr. Keefe. Their practice is so highly respected and has high success rates, that it's worth it to me. Prepare to listen and make decisions. You come to doctor for a solution, not for compassion. Be prepared that you won't receive a lot of attention.Stay organized and don’t be afraid to speak up if you want to try something and ask for his honest opinion on it. While doctors can do their best to give their most educated advice, they are not psychics and part of figuring out which treatment to move forward with is in part a personal choice. Be ready to advocate for yourself and do not expect to be guided at all. Ask a thousand questions if you do get the chance to speak with him (different protocols, what could they adjust, what levels are they looking for and on what basis will they adjust doses) - don’t expect any of this information to be volunteered as you may never actually see Dr L in person again after your first visit. He doesn’t always answer calls, but he DOES respond to emails.The doctor and his research is top notch. You have to be prepared mentally to deal with the NYU clinic - which is a whole other story. Ask as many questions as you can and know your medical history so you get the most out of your time with him.He is not going to hold your hand during the process but you will get excellent results. Have all of your questions prepared before seeing him or getting him on the phone. He's willing to spend time with you answering them, but is quick and succinct, so be prepared. He is not overly warm, but after completing several cycles with him, I can attest he is a compassionate doctor. He's not the doctor you go to for a close Dr./Patient relationship. You go to him for his expertise and experience. To be patient, and to understand that as much as you'd like to see Dr. Grifo every time you are there, there are doctors of the day for a reason. Trust that he is very informed of your journey, and is always available if you want to schedule a call or email. I would do some baseline research before attending your first appointment and come ready with a list of detailed questions. Be upfront about your ideas and plans for treatment and email him with any questions or concerns, you’ll get the quickest reply. Go to him!! And trust him and his experience and judgement.Book earlier than you think. They are very busy and it can take a while to get an initial appointment.Bring pen and paper with you because Dr. Fino can give you a ton of information and advice! The clinic will give you booklets and written instructions, but she can you answer your specific questions very thoroughly and in detail! Ask him if he does his best the first try to maximize results or does a one-size-fits-all approach the first time assuming you'll have to do multiple rounds and at that point he starts to focus on tailoring approaches.Listen to your gutAsk as many questions as you have ---she will make time for you and answer them.  I always felt bad taking her time during my morning monitoring appointments as she had dozens of patients to see but she always insisted that I asked all my questions as she'd rather answer them in person.Ask as many questions as you’d like. She will answer them all. But also do some research on your own so you have questions to ask. She is the expert, use her ! Do tons of research and have a lot of questions prepared.  I would suggest for anybody to visit an endocrinologist first prior to starting any fertility treatments.  I would also suggest to ask if there will be a lead nurse on your case.Stay connected closely. Ask questions. Be in touch Be honest with her. Tell her all of your concerns and the circumstances that are affecting your life in the process, as they relate to the process. For example I had a myomectomy 12 months ago and have a major concern for the medications to increase the return of uterine fibroids. She and her team have been monitoring my fibroids along the way and been thoughtful about my medications. Since I am single and pursuing this on my own, I was also upfront about the costs that I can bear and those that I can't. While she is direct with me about the best possible outcomes I NEVER feel bullied into procedures that I cannot afford. She is truly wonderful.Try to take your emotions out of the equation as much as possible. Convince yourself you are making the best possible choice by enduring IVF: 1) you are maximizing your chances, 2) you are controlling the outcome (if you are doing PGS you are screening the best quality embryos in advance, and you are lowering your miscarriage chances to lower rates than mother nature), 3) you are taking an expensive, emotionally tolling, short-cut to starting a family, if time is of the essence for you. 

Personally, IVF me dread every evening of treatment, but I took one day at a time, and even tried to enjoy the fact that I was taking control over my destiny (vs. years worth of trying, especially if you are retrieving a high number of eggs per cycle --imagine the monthly disappointments, or even mourning a miscarriage (which happened to be in the recent past). 

Grifo is a matter-of-the-fact person, so if you are able to rationalize all the facts above, he is the doctor for you. He can be personable, funny, and charmingly smart.Patients who are seeking an honest assessment of their fertility issues and chances at conceiving will do well under Dr. Berkeley's care.  He is kind and compassionate, but he is not a man who will sugar coat your situation.  If this is the type of doctor you seek, then you will be very happy with his treatment.Ask questions and demand clear answers.  She has a way of talking in circles. She wants to tell you what she wants to tell you.  Not necessarily what you want to know.  Don't expect warm & fuzzy, but you'll get so much more that this.If you are comfortable with a straightforward/blunt doctor that you can count on to listen to you and help you shape a plan based on your individual needs, then she is for you. If you need someone to hand-hold you every step of the way, she might not be... but I've found her to be a caring and comforting doctor.I believe she is experienced doctor with knowledge. But you have to ask her. She is not gonna tell you 1 to 10. I think you  should write down what you want to ask before visit. She is not gonna tell you extra info unless you ask.Don't be discouraged by the fact that you don't see her very often or that you can't get immediate access to her.  She is exceptionally responsive and thorough and if you schedule a call you will get all the time you want/need with her.  She's been fantastic and I trust her completely.  You're one-on-one time with her may be limited so always be prepared with questions. That being said, it's not difficult to reach a nurse or another doctor in the practice that can help you along the way. Don't be afraid to ask her any questions. She is very patient and kind. She will provide straightforward diagnosis, but she is very kind, professional and confident in all of her treatments.  Feel free to ask as many questions as possible.  Note however that there is always a lot of information, but you will have multiple opportunities to go over everything at each step.Do NOT chose him as your doctor. Utilize the west side clinic.Dr. Grifo may come off as cold and standoffish; however, you should not be afraid to ask any questions. I would encourage to ask as many questions as possible and pick his very knowledgeable brain. Be your own advocate!   He is very honest and up-front. Be in touch with him a lot if you want actual feedback re your protocol. Don't rely only on the nurses. He will not oversee your actual case but if you want him to check something, he will. I think in all of our cycles I only saw him in the ultrasound room once during morning monitoring periods.Go into your initial consultation fully organized and prepared with any prior lab work, medical history, genetic testing all relevant to fertility.  Also, make sure that you get clarity on exactly what blood tests and exams you'll need done or updated prior to starting any cycle; infectious disease panel, day 2-3 labs, semen analysis, mammogram, etc.  Also, know that you as patient will have to be the proactive one.  You'll have to make tough decisions on how many rounds of IvF you can handle, whether to transfer mosaic embryos (if that is all you have), how many transfers you're wiling to go through, and when to call it quits.  I understand why NYU Fertility doesn't proactively nudge you in either direction because they are first and foremost a clinic (not a research lab).  But likewise, don't expect any proactive outreachor guidance on whether to continue (unless explicitly advised otherwise) either.  She is very open with sharing her own personal stories, but she isn't warm and fuzzy. If you are looking for warm and fuzzy, you won't get that from her.Ask questions. He offers the information the average person wants to hear, but if you are like me and want to understand all the details, ask him to elaborate. He will, and he will explain it clearly until you are satisfied. Also, you can't separate him from the NYU, the clinic that he practices in - NYU is large, and it is important for you to advocate for yourself. However, we were happy with almost all the nurses and staff there and always knew we could go directly to Dr. Licciardi with questions or concerns. Don't hesitate to ask for an appointment with him and don't hesitate to ask questions. He likes to share his knowledge.
If you have an urgent question on your treatment, I would go through the nurse though.Make sure you request phone calls with him since you won't see him in person (if doing an IUI). But he is very responsive and receptive on the phone.Go sooner rather than later.Be prepared to work with her team more than her. Be extremely persistent in regards to communication- she will not follow up it is really on you to make extra phone calls and demand calls back and time to talk to her about issues you may haveUnderstand that you will not see her directly or be able to access her directly during cycles, but rest assured that the clinic is a well oiled machine.Ask as many questions as you need to. Tell him how important it is for you that HE himself monitors your daily appointments. Listen to his advice, whether good or bad. He does not say things just to be nice, if he thinks you are progressively positiviely, you are!I would caution prospective patients not to be turned off my the fact tha tDr. Hodes is not as I experienced as some of the other REs at NYU.  It is true that she has not been practicing for decades, but what she lacks in experience, she makes up for in knowledge, compassion, and commitment to her patients.  I never questioned that I was in extremely capable hands.Ask blunt questions and expect him to be straightforward with you.Ask all of your questions. He is so thorough and knowledgeable and speaks to you in way that makes it easy to understand. So be sure to bring a list! She is skilled doctor and knows her stuff.  But do not expect a warm and fuzzy doctor. He is a great doctor but demand more personalized care. Do your homework and ask all the questions you need. Be sure that your comfortable with your course of treatmentOnly go to Dr. Berkeley when you are absolutely ready to commit yourself to doing whatever it would take to have children.  He will help until he absolutely can't and than some!He's a busy doctor. It's not always easy to speak to him right away, but he will see you or set up time to talk to you if you are willing to wait a week or so. When I had a question that was easily answered by email, he answered through his assistant quickly.   But when I needed treatment, he was right on it. When I needed minor surgery, he scheduled me for surgery two days after diagnosis and he did the surgery himself.  If you have a question that the nurses can't answer, don't be afraid to call Dr. Fino's office directly.Make an appointment as early as possible! It can take a few months to get a new patient appointment.I don't think I can think of any at this time. If you choose to go this route, find a way to beat the system so you can speak to the Dr himself, instead of dealing only with the ""doctor of the day"" or nurses.Come with all your questions he will take the time to go through them. Be prepared for a long waiting time for the apt though You're an adult. He will treat you like one. You can get compassion from your husband and your friends... Grifo will give you numbers, data, statistics. He'll also temper your expectations which I appreciated. Then when I received 20 eggs, it was like Christmas.The patient should expect honesty, but understand he and the clinic are trying to get good numbers.  He will recommend what he thinks gives you the best chance of success at having a baby, especially considering most of us have limited resources and usually can't do more than two IVF cycles with our insurance.  As a patient, you want to pull out all the stops.  I think that dynamic goes on with all the doctors. But I do believe he really believes in his work and wants to help.  I feel he has your personal best interest in mind when working with youTrust his approach and go to him if you are comfortable with a top notch Doctor in a very busy practice. You may not get a ton of 1:1 attention but you will get great care.Don't expect warm and fuzzy but a very experienced doctor who will get you good results.Be ready to have complete strangers give you internal ultrasounds at 7:05 am. If you this bothers you, than NYU, Cornell, or any big time center, is not the place.
Talk to the person in the finance office that deals with medications and insurance. I was able to get my medication covered through Aenta Speciality Pharmacy. Aetna themselves did not tell me this, one of the patient coordinators at NYU told me to go through Aenta Speciality Pharmacy. 
The medications are brutal but you just need to power through it with your eye on the end result. 
Write everything down the doctors and nurses tell you during monitoring and nightly calls.  
Stay organized by inputting your medication doses and timing on the calendar on your phone. 
Keep track of your medication supplies daily, and check with the doctors/nurse weekly to be sure you have the correct supplies and enough medication to complete your cycle. 
Never give up. After having my first cycle cancelled I was devastated. I pushed through and ended up with 34 eggs...Don't be shy.  She responds well to questions:  ask them.Make sure you come in with questions, and ask if you don’t understand something. Come prepared with as many questions as you can. You will have ample time to ask, so take notes! She should be more concerned about their well being rather than having them pay for costly treatments that may not be helpful. She should also be more candid about the risks and benefits of all procedures and provide all options at the outset. Finally, if she is not going to perform retrievals she should ensure the staff doing so are well trained and highly qualified.Ask questions because he is available and willing to explain. She is a wonderful doctor, and I would have been happy to work with her, but at NYU  there are no guarantees of which doctor will see you for appointments which was not a good fit for me.Lower expectations of doctor facetime/contact.  Doctor is difficult to get ahold of by phone.Be proactive. If you want to see her or talk to her, make the appointment. If you have questions, ask. To ask a lot of questions because she will answer you honestly, not sugar coating, but also not making you feel helpless.Make your appointment ASAP. The wait for a first appointment is like 2 months.Don't expect to be hand held throughout the process. Be prepared that she will be honest. She is not going to sugar coat your chances. If you have financial flexibility and are told you cannot proceed with an IVF cycle because of various hormones, go get a 2nd opinion from RMA.Don’t expect to see him often. If you need to speak, his assistants will give you a small window in which he will call you. Have your questions ready and be open to any course of action proposed. Give Dr. Goldman all details of your situation from financial to medical to personal.trust herHe's been doing this a long time and has loads of experience, but if I was to do this all again, I'd have pushed for more aggressive treatment -- or recommendation on alternate measures (donor, GC, etc.). Trust her clinical judgment and expertise.make as many questions as you can so that you get all explain. Try to think of those before hand. Ask for psychological support if you needEnsure to keep track of your own records of hormones, blood tests etc.Ask his thought process behind the hormone doses he chooses.  Also ask his viewpoint on whether eggs or embryos makes more sense, given your age and goals. Take advantage of his expertise, and don't hesitate to ask questions.Dr Licciardi is part of a large practice. He will not be with you every step of the way. There are many other doctors and nurses that you will see on a daily basis once your treatment starts. Each dr in the practice has a specific day when they do transfers, retrievals and other procedures. Which dr you get depends on your cycle and the day of the week. Don't be disappointed- dr Licciardi still knows what's happening to his patients. Give her a chance.  She is probably more junior than some of the other doctors within NYU but is very nurturing, honest and ultimately skilled in what she does.Expect a long time to get an appt with Dr. Keefe. Think positively!! Always do your own research and be aware of the right questions to ask.Be prepared for a wait to get an appointment but once you're in, it's all good.Request him to be present at the transfer if important to you.Ask questions you have. If you ade asking for advice, he will offer you his opinion of things which is helpful.Go to him! Do some research ahead of time.  Also, he is a bit conservative.  Other doctors in other clinics have different approaches.  Do your homework and breath a lot. To be personally on top of her own treatment cycle and insist on getting explanations if she notices any discrepencies or if something seems wrong.Trust him and know you are in good handsIf you aren’t ready for IVF don’t bother. Dr Berkely is a bit dated in his methods.  He was not very proactive or aggressive in his approach.  I felt he was too factual and did not provide sensitivity for patients during a difficult time.Be ready for the most direct doctor you have ever met.Bring your questions, it will be answered by a man of science.Come prepared to ask questions. Trust your doctor and the process. If you want to have lots of personal interaction with Dr Noyes she might not be the Dr for you. Also, if you have low ovarian reserve talk to her about aggressive vs non aggressive protocols in advance.Don't let the receptionist annoy you.

Don't be afraid to ask questions Do research and ask about trying different methods to achieve pregnancy.Make sure you ask the questions you want answered. Don't expect to be coddled.Your in good hands and if you have questions ask hell be happy to helpDr. Noyes is very honest and straightforward. Sometimes the truth is pretty ugly, but the sooner you know what your situation is, the sooner you can figure out the best course of action.Understand that you won't see her every time you come in for visits (and there will be a lot of them). But that she is aware of what's going on and is monitoring everything. Perhaps the only thing I would have advised was only doing IUI once and if that failed to go straight to IVF.Get to know his nursesDo some reading ahead of time and have a list of questions ready. You get overwhelmed once your in there with the doctorTalk open and honestly and listen. Come with questions and a thorough knowledge of your own medical history Contact his assistant if you need anything. She is very responsive. not necessarily warm & fuzzy (which i was okay with)-- but could find that to be not for everyone.To be upfront about everything and clear on your history.  Be prepared it is group of Doctor's so he may not be the one performing your extractions and implantation. Trust him. Even if you don’t like what he has to say, trust that he will do everything he can to get you a baby. be patientTalk to him about any doubts and ask questions regarding potential complications Ask your questions, she will answer all of them thoroughly and thoughtfully.She will listen to what your hopes are and will be honest with you in coming up with your treatment plan. I very much appreciated her honest opinion and help in managing my expectations. ",8.0,8.199999999999994,"They seem longwinded but are designed to reassure you as a patient. Best doctor at NYU Don't be overwhelmed by the size of the office or the staff. If you need someone to hand-hold you every step of the way, she might not be... but I've found her to be a caring and comforting doctor. Ask blunt questions and expect him to be straightforward with you. I think that dynamic goes on with all the doctors."
16,NYU Langone Fertility Center,nurse,"The nurses and monitoring staff were all fantastic and hugged us goodbye when we graduated from fertility clinic to an OB. Once it became clear that I would not be able to conceive on my own, we were transferred to the donor egg program. We never spoke to Autumn Arroyo, who we were told was the donor egg program coordinator. Instead, we had a meeting with a psychologist, Shelley Lee. During our mandatory meeting, Dr. Lee repeatedly mispronounced my family's country of origin. She said, given my ethnic heritage it would take at least 6 months to find a donor for me. We waited 6 months, and didn't hear from NYU's program. After waiting 8 months, I made an appointment with another fertility clinic. I finally heard from Dr. Lee 1 year and 4 months after our appointment. During that time period, I became pregnant on my own, had a miscarriage, and found another donor at much more organized and caring program. (They even found a donor who shared my Caribbean heritage.) My new team displayed a kindness, and sympathy that I didn't receive under NYU's care. 1 year and 4 months when you are desperately trying to conceive is inexcusably long. Fortunately, I found another clinic that treated me as an individual and not a case file.The nursing staff at NYU were all wonderful and very supportive and responsive. They were very comforting as well. I was very satisfied with the nursing staff,Compared to all other staff, nurses, care coordinators, My Care-coordinator-Shantel did not impressed me with her care. It was someone difficult to get through to her, get her call returned or my questions answered prompt. Whenever answered, was dry and cold with responses. However, other staff quickly covered, stepped in and addressed all my issues.  If I could not get a hold of Shantel, someone else helped me right away regardless of the complexity of issues. For the most part, Carol was good with us. At times, however she could be a bit gruff on the phone (not always) and there was a time or two when we had to follow up to make sure we clearly understood what we were supposed to be doing.Nurses were very good Natalie is warm, friendly, a great communicator and very supportive.  She always took the time to stop by and say hi when she same I had checked in for blood draws which was completely unnecessary but showed how dedicated she is to her patients.  All directions were clear and she helped with pharmacies when prescriptions were delayed.  I couldn't have asked for a better nurse.Even though the clinic was super busy, she remembered me and called a lot. She was always pleasant and clear in her communication.They are all professionals yet they understand the emotions that infertility brings about and they are very sensitive to that.Someone was always available to speak with on the phone whenever I had questions. The NYU staff was very thorough an organized about calling me with results immediately, booking me for follow up appointments, ensuring our billing was sorted and organizing our insurance paperwork. It was never a problem to get in quickly for morning monitoring (I never waited over 5-10 min). And, they nurses were always friendly --- i felt like we knew each other after 6 months! In addition, we took a 3 hour, in-person course on IVF. I was kicking and screaming going into it because it meant I needed to miss a couple hours of work... but wow, it is so necessary. I highly recommend that everyone take this course before going down the IVF pathThe NYU FC nurses are great, there are a lot of them with varying levels of experience but the senior nurses are extremely knowledgeable, very responsive (once I could not reach my nurse because she was in the OR but they share files and my problem was solved by another nurse right away). Given their volume, they operate like a well-oiled machine.Every single nurse or coordinator I have dealt with has been amazing. They are friendly, remember your name, comforting and knowledgeable. They always make me feel that they care and are here to help. They are responsive and informative. I am very happy with the team of nurses!Mary and the other nurses were wonderful and helpful. They are efficient and compassionate.The nursing staff was experienced, knowledgeable and easy to reach and talk to. Nurse Carol is the best thing in this place. She is thorough , professional, no nonsense, detailed and good communicator. Always immediately calls back with answers. Really like herThey are amazing, all incredibly thoughtful, warm and capable women. All encouraging of the process and mindful of all the components involved (billing, meds, travel to the clinic, scheduling.) I have felt like they have held my hand every single step of the way.For this third cycle, Aleksandra has been my main nurse care coordinator.  She is personable, skilled, scientific and warm.  I could not be more pleased with her care and the time she has taken to answer my questions and reply to my emails.  She is a true compassionate caregiver and I am very grateful.Mary is the main point of contact for many of the IVF patients and she is incredible. All of the onsite nurses and professional and reliable.The nurses and other staff are very caring and patient. They return phone calls and emails promptly. When I needed a copy of my records emailed to me they had it done very quickly. Autumn is awesome. She is very compassionate, patient and sweet. I really like her as my coordinator. The nurses and the nursing staff have to deal with a lot of patient. While they try their best to have time for each patient, it is not always easy. I remember being really upset after my second Clomid cycle did not work and I discovered I had 2 cyctes and the nurse not being very compassionate about it... like she did not know what to do. I am sure it was not the first time, a woman cried in their office. I was surprised to see how they poorly dealt with it.The NYU Fertility Center nursing staff is amazing.  After each visit I received a follow up call within 24 hours with test results and instructions on next steps.  They were all very warm, informative, and efficient over the phone.  I talked to nurses more regularly than seeing them.I dont remember who was who- but the people taking blood where nice- main nurse that I worked with was super responsible in returning phone calls and calling in results-Nursing staff was great. Team oriented but my nurse was he one I called with specific questions. Always called back right away with answers to my questions and very thorough and efficient during morning monitoring. The donor nurses are great (at least as of Fall 2015).Loved her. She gave me her email and always emailed right back.  There were some problems on the weekend - as you know egg retrieval is a two-week procedure - so I was always a little freaked when I couldn't get through but someone always called right back.They were very helpful, but also very busy in the mornings.  The donor egg staff were very professional but very warm as the process went on.  The lead nurses on the regular staff were very kind to me and I appreciated it.  Anytime I called before and during cycle Amber always called me back same day.  She explained things to me 100 times and told me what to expect.  The nurses for bloodwork were great and the wait time was never long. Day of transfer the nurse who talked me thru it was amazing and so positive and caring.  I did not have a care coordinator but Wana was very involved in my care.  She was helpful at instructing me about how to do the injections.  Also, she assisted me when I ran out of medicine and needed to expedite orders the pharmacy.The nurses are all great. Responsive to messages, knowledgeable, compassionate, patient and encouraging! The staff is excellent at Dr. Grifo's office! Very communicative, and has spent a lot of time on the phone explaining things to me. NYU Fertility’s nursing staff is well organized.  The blood and ultrasound monitoring queues are efficiently run. Aleksandra was a god send! She entertained my craziness and made me feel so comfortable. Even after I left their care, she emailed me just to see how I am progressing w my pregnancy. They are very helpful and knowledgeable but hard to get in touch with at times.

17,NYU Langone Fertility Center,clinic,"You do feel a bit like a number in a factory. However, I wonder if this may be true for every fertility clinic. When I wanted personal attention, I asked for it and got it. We are still early on in our treatment so have not had much interaction with the nursing staff and have nearly exclusively dealt with Dr. Berkeley.The nurses were responsive when called -- always returned phone calls and gave directions clearly. During morning monitoring were pretty aloof, but did the job and got patients in and out of bloodwork quickly. Ultrasounds took quite a bit longer (I'm sure that was more about the doctors than the nurses).Orientation session that you must attend is very informative. Billing is straightforward for the most part, however those on the staff who are responsible for processing pre-authorizations of insurance are not the most responsive always -- you need to be persistent at times to get the information you need.Morning monitoring typically takes about an hour with ultrasound due to wait times. The system seems kind of random after you check in though I'm sure there's a method to their madness. There is a process for follow-up calls, and they have never not provided instructions when expected. What would be helpful is if they provided you with a follicle count and size for each visit, in writing. The nursing staff in the west side office felt like family, you do see them very often. It was a much better experience than on 1st ave. They were completely disorganized, abrupt and unfriendly. The practice is large and runs like a well oiled machine. We appreciated that monitoring hours were strictly for monitoring. Other clinics also performed IUIs during monitoring hours. NYU also included blood work in their monitoring and not all clinics do. Very professional, educated and direct. They are efficient and well-trained.NYU is one of the leaders in IVF and has perfected the process. They know what they're doing and I highly trust them. The downside is that they've operationalized the process so much that the experience often feels like a factory. I'd love to see greater personalization and more guided interactionVery busy with lots of people coming in and out; nevertheless relatively well organized and answers were fairly timely.  DId have a couple of issues with assigned nurse not being very communicative.

Felt old/tired in terms of layout and cleanliness and technology.Be prepared to meet other doctors, other than your own, throughout your visits. The clinic is run like a factory, as most fertility clinics are, so don't be alarmed.
The office opens pretty early which is nice for working individuals. All of the nurses were amazing as they were very friendly and educational. I specifically spoke to Andrea almost every time and she was a fresh breath of air.  There are several nurses that handle the IUI process and all of them have been pleasant to work with. Despite treating a large number of patients, they frequently remember my name and treatment history without having to look at my chart. They've helped keep me positive about this process and frequently done a good job at answering questions before I even think to ask them. All the staff in that office treated us like we were machines. They gave us tons of papers with information, and they kept mentioning dates and enumerate steps of procedures in the most impersonal way I can possibly describe.The nurses as well are very nice and knowledgable. They are friendly, yet do there best to get you in and out as quickly as possible. They definitely have their process down to a T. There is no question that NYU is a busy practice, but their focus is on billing patients (you check into billing before you are seen every single time you go to the office), not on patient care. The nurse didn't call in my prescriptions before my cycle. I had one physician whose name I can't remember who was counting my follicles during my first and only stim cycle. It was a disaster. While she read my ultrasound results, I asked innocently, ""Is that bad?"" and she answered flippantly, ""Well, it's not good."" As well, it took over 1 year and 4 months to hear back from the donor egg program. Although I really liked my physician, you rarely see or speak to your main physician. This is common with most fertility practices. What is not common? NYU's lack of basic patient care. The nurses were amazing.  I was coming in from Westchester and needed to get back to work in Westchester by 8:30 am, so I would get to monitoring at 6:30 am. They did their best to take me back first each morning, which was a huge relief. The nursing staff was thoughtful and compassionate and tried to help me find discount medications due to my cancer statusThe nursing staff is very efficient and nice. They generally got me in and out quickly in the mornings and had a good bedside manner. If I had a question, I generally got a timely call back. The one thing I would say is that the practice is very busy, so sometimes you have to be a little aggressive to make sure you get a call back or get taken care of quickly. However, I never felt like they weren't trying to give me a good experience. It's just hard with so many patients. The quality of the care was always great though.Office was never crowded or overbooked and we were always given plenty of time with the doctor. The main weakness for us as a queer couple was a mandatory counselling session that for how far we already were in our process and knowledge was unneeded and a waste of time and money, but for those earlier in the process I could understand how it could be helpful. I think any queer couples that have a donor agreement through lawyers and have been trying on their own should have the process waived.NYU was a pretty seamless, easy operation for me. The doctors were reachable, monitoring easy... even billing was pretty straight-forward. What I didn't like was the very safe approach, and the wait for ultrasounds. They are knowledgeable but quite cold in my option. Felt like I was one more number.... There is a team of people you deal with. I found them all very nice in person. My one complaint is that they could be difficult to reach by phone. My calls, even during business hours to the nursing staff, often went to the answering service. If you have a busy schedule, it can be easy to miss the call they place back resulting in a lot of frustrating phone tag.There are many of them but it was mostly limited to drawing blood and then then a follow up phone call for me. They were all pleasant and helpful. It sort of felt like a factory, the nurses went by my birth date, not name :(They were friendly, and always remembered you. My experience at Cornell was so cold and awful that walking into NYU and the nurses greeting you by name was a welcome surprise! Very kind but wish that they would call you prior to 12pm- sometimes you had to wait for results until 4/5pmFriendly and efficient!The nursing staff was very sweet and efficient, i never had to wait too long.The 1st ave office is always very busy and feels like a baby making factory. There should be more smaller offices set up like the west side office that require appointments an feel more personal with familiar faces and nurses and receptionist that remember your name (since you can be there every day for weeks at a time) NYU is a big clinic but they are a well oiled machine. Arrive early for daily monitoring and you will get in and out quickly. All the nurses are fantastic and billing dept is very easy to deal with.Everyone is rushed, the nurses are disorganized and not always aware of your treatment plan. You need to keep following up and remind them of details. The staff is generally cold, unfriendly and impatient.  There seems to be a disconnect between doctors, nurses, coordinators. helpful.Its clean and efficient - reception staff are great and they make you feel comfortableThe team at NYU fertility is amazing. They felt like family. I was always seen promptly and felt I received the best care even with the high volume of patients, I always felt supported and that I could get my questions answered. I would recommend getting there by 6:45. I was out by 7:30 the latest with bloodeork and ultrasound. front desk staff was horrible. Efficient, clean and functional.organized in terms of sending you to billing and taking blood.  it was very hard getting an appointment with Dr. Fino.  sometimes I had a phone call scheduled and she called at an odd time or did not call.Very experienced staff, well oiled machine. It feels like the do this all the time and know all of the possible complications.
Even though they have lots of patients the level of care is individual. I would definitely recommend this centerIt is a busy clinic and you don't see your doctor every visit, but she checked in frequently and made all of my plans. NYU is a reputable clinic with good outcomes so I felt the business was worth the while.I love these women! They are exceptional, all of them.  Caring, kind, compassionate and HUMAN. They know me by name and are all cheering me on. I absolutely love Dr. Wertz's assistant Sarnia. She's the best! Organized, on top of everything, just a great person and professional. Otherwise, there're a lot of nurses in a process, sometimes it seems as too much. I can't remember everyone's name and phone and duty. The IVF coordinator I got in touch with is rarely available, never picks up and appears overwhelmed. But the good thing is that all of them have access to information and know what's going on. Some of the nurses were amazing- kind and informative. Others seemed to have no idea what I was talking about, and one even tried to tell me I didn't know what kind of cycle I was having! Really hit or miss depending on who you get.The nursing staff was always so nice and friendly. Sometimes can be a bit unorganized but only on minor things. The morning clinic is a work horse - you come in and then you leave and it is all business. It's an odd thing - but there is no sense of community, not once did another patient say something kind to me or smile, everyone looks at their phones. The nurses are moving people through as fast as possible. Whole thing is very odd - unlike anything I have ever experienced. They have a very strong team of capable nurses at NYU. They were all very professional and kind. They answered all of my questions and were problem solvers when it came to making sure you had the medications you need. Cherie had a lot of insight into where to go to get medications and ways to save money on certain medications by applying for grants & discount programs. The nurses before and after my egg retrieval and FET were very kind and professional as well. You may see the same nurses during blood work, but often they are different. I never encountered any nursing staff who were rude or unkind. Nurses on retrieval day were very sweet and caring. It used to be painful to call the clinic. You got the answering service each time, even during business hours, but they have changed it recently. Someone actually answers the call and they try to get someone on the line that can help you real time. The wait times can be long during monitoring hours, but I've been to RMA as well and it's bad everywhere. Get there early. They move through monitoring quickly. The nursing staff was very knowledgable, encouraging, kind and patient. They were very thorough when calling with results and directions. I  appreciated they also help talked me through the emotional implications of all of this. The entire nursing staff at NYU is well-informed, compassionate, and efficient. They reassured me and answered all of my questions. I had many issues with my insurance coverage and offered me many tips on the best ways to save on things like lab work and medication coverage. My only complaint is that it is very difficult to get anyone on the phone during business hours. Friendly and well organized.I don't have anything negative to say about this clinic.  It's very busy and there are a lot of doctors and nurses but I have had a positive experience with each and every one.  I never waited more than 5 minutes and I always receive a call or email back within 2 hours.The nursing staff is very knowledgeable when calling with questions. The nurses line is an answering service, you leave a message and they get back to you same day. They are friendly when coming in for appointments. On the day of retrieval everyone was very positive. It gave a good feeling. During your cycles at NYU you will see a slew amount of nurses.  Most of them are nice and warm but the issue here is that there is nobody really following your case, nor they have the time.  for example:
1) i asked via email what to do with my leftover lupron? and why i had an unused medication called vivelle and what were those for?  to that i was left a voicemail that said lupron expires in 30 days.
2) i was told once by one nurse during a cycle, i am confused by your protocol not sure what to do.  
3) during the beginning of one of my IVF i realized i had a lot of medication left over from cancelled cycle.  i requested that the nurse only provides a prescription for what i needed.  but again since nobody is really following your chart she said she could not do that and would leave me on my voice mail the amount she requested to the pharmacy so i can cross reference with my inventory.  Then, i called the pharmacy myself to reduce the count of each medication.  it is important to call out that fertility medications like Menapure or Gonal can quickly add up to a bill of 5k to 10k depending of the amount.  so for me it was really stressful and careless to have gone about it in this manner.The FC NYU is a well-oiled machine. 1:1 interactions with nurses are great. And when you have to call for questions, the message service is tremendously impersonal, but efficient. Nurses will call you back in a couple of hours, and leave very unambiguous voice mails. They are great. 

A few of them are more talkative and will give you invaluable tips (that should probably be part of orientation), such as: 1) if you are doing PGS, what is the best possible way to optimize timing (brith control pills); 2) if you are using the Gonal F or Follastim pens, don't throw them away if they are not completely finished as you can get a full day worth of dosage in it, or even combine it with a brand new cartridge, representing hundreds of dollars of savings in the end; 3) don't buy all drugs at once, get supplies worth a few days, because you never know how quickly your body will respond to drugs, and you might get stuck with a ton of expensive drugs you can't return. There are many nurses and they all seem somewhat confused and overworked.  The issue is their phone system.  You can't call anyone directly.  You have to always leave a message and they call you back.  I really dislike this.  Overall i think they are too overloaded. They do very well given this, but I think it can at times compromise their focus and care. I have found them primarily to be professional, knowledgeable, friendly and understanding of the trial the IVF experience is. But I did sometimes feel shuttled through an assembly line at times. At times they seemed as grumpy as we were to be there at 7 a.m. on a Sunday.I believe this is a top rated clinic in the U.S. for a reason. I've had several friends have success with this practice, and I chose it because I truly believe they're experts in this field and can help me get results. Make no mistake, it is a large practice and if you meander into the office during the last 15 minutes of Morning Monitoring hours on a weekend, it's going to be standing room only and it is going to take a while to be seen. That said, all of the staff have treated me with courtesy and care and I have never been made to feel like a number - despite clearly knowing that I am one of a large number of patients. There were nurses that I see at visit. But I don't know them well and they don't know me well either. Most of them are well trained nurses. But because there are so many patients. Again they are doing their best. But you feel like you are on assembly line.The NYU nursing staff is like my family.  They all know me by name, are upbeat friendly faces to see every morning monitoring.  Can't say enough about this staff.  Really love them.The nursing staff is extraordinary at the NYU langone practice. They would always provide clear instructions about my medication and injections. I always received a return phone call, if I had questions. They were so kind during my morning monitoring. I have been spoiled by their treatment!Great nursing staff.  Always helpful, compassionate and informative.  Only issue with 1 nurse over the 10-15 we saw over a 5 month period.It was clean. But being there felt very impersonal, and all the staff were pretty bad communicators. We were guided to at least 4 different desks, where different nurses and admin staff talked to us about different parts of the procedures, and none of them seemed to care about or even realize that I was so overwhelmed I was about to break down in tears. They have no good internal processes, and it ends up being quite upsetting to just even be there. NYU is an egg freezing machine that kinda feels like a MedSpa.There, I did not always see my doctor for ultrasounds throughout the process, but whoever was on staff, and all of the doctors I had were very nice and talked me through what they were seeing on my ultrasound as well as how much longer they thought I had in the process...I liked the West Side location for blood and ultrasound much better because there was never any wait like there can be on the East and you can go right before 9am (not so early as the East side) and be out by 9:15am. I found it more efficient, faster and easier for me since I live on the West side.  Very hit or miss. Some excellent nurses. Some not so excellent nurses. It seems in the five years that I've been a patient at NYU that things have gotten more like a factory and there is just a huge volume of patients, more than there was when I was first there. For the most part, everyone is cheerful and upbeat, but they don't all have the same level of experience and I was given misinformation at least once. Also came away from blood taking very bruised once or twice. Had to ice and it wasn't when I was having daily blood tests. On the plus side, if you do get to know one of the nurses, sometimes you can get that person's direct line if you want their opinion. Nurse's take of picture was sometimes different than my doctor's so it was confusing at times.Nurses overall were pretty good.  They communicated instructions pretty well and were generally good about returning calls.  A couple nurses in particular were outstanding - they were not only competent at their jobs, but patient with listening to and answering all questions, compassionate and caring, which went above and beyond.  Sandra, Nicky, and Lavina, were a few of the exceptional nurses; they were really kind, and I appreciated their compassion throughout the process.We dealt with many nurses and there was only one we didn't care for. Overall, the nurses were very helpful. We did part of our cycle remotely and most of the nurses went the extra mile, following up with our local lab to ensure they got the blood work in a timely way. The nurses were knowledgable and caring. Again, NYU is a large clinic and it is important when dealing with so many different people that you are your own advocate and make sure the nurse you are speaking with is aware of the full picture.  There were two main nurses I saw who both did the IUI. Both were nice and chatty in a good way as it relaxed me. With one the procedure hurt, with the other not as much, but both were nice and answered questions I had.NYU has a smaller clinic on the Westside of Manhattan that was a life saver for me w/ all of the early morning blood draws and ultrasounds. I have to be at work by 8am and going to NYU on the East side would've been very stressful. The nurses were accommodating (arriving early for me), sympathetic and I truly felt like they were rooting for me. They were always patient and kind. Rarely had the same one twice; however, all were kind and intelligent.  Always received a call back promptly from a nurse when I left a voicemail with the clinic.  The nursing staff was very efficient and compassionate. My only complaint is there is no direct phone number to reach them at, you always have to leave a message and they will call you back.I did not really get to know any one nurse particularly well.  NYU is a large practice so there are many nurses on staff.  I communicated with many nurses, and I found just about all of them to be compassionate and knowledgeable.  The nursing staff was proficient and experienced. They did not seem particularly compassionate or personal. More just about business and trying to be efficient, which was ok with me, because there were a lot of people to get through in the mornings. It would have been nice if they'd introduced themselves when they called your name or drew your blood.Patient and kind, and funny - which always helps. The nursing staff was good and was responsive to calls.  Efficient, respectful and caring to us every morning (and they were EARLY mornings!)  They were ready to get the best job done at ~6:45am every day we were there and were attentive to our emotional needs as well.They were friendly! Such a difference from my last clinic and so important as you see them every morning. IT ran very efficiently and quick. Due to my work, I was the one frequently being tardy for my blood work and US-monitoring, yet I never felt uncomfortable for creating inconvenience to the rest of staff. Always been treated kindly, with respect and well taken care of. Not once anyone made me feel guilty for running late, yet I never had to wait for more then few minutes to be seen. I mostly dealt with Carol or Andrea and wasn't assigned a specific nurse.  At NYU, nurses are really the only point people available to patients on a predictable basis.  All calls are returned by a nurse (not a doctor), and in fact, a nurse did my actual IUI.  The nurses were generally pleasant but when my short-lived pregnancy turned out not to be viable, I thought they could have done better.  The nurse who called me to inform me that my HCG levels were declining was a nurse I had never met or spoken to before, and she let me know via voicemail about my declining HCG level and that I should come back on in several days for bloodwork and an ultrasound.  I reached out to Evelyn Arroyo (I think she's Dr. Berkeley's assistant) about this (which required me to go behind the system a bit) and said I'd like to speak to a doctor about this - particularly Dr. Fino since she has seen me for the past 2 times.  I did not receive a call back from either Dr. Fino or Dr. Berkeley.There are a lot of them. Most were extraordinary. Some were great. Others were not. Luckely I dealt with wonderful nurses but occasionally I had a bad one. Loved the nursing staff. Personable and very experienced. They are who you will see most often. There were two main nurse coordinators during my treatment and they were excellent with the many many follow up phone calls after each blood draw. They would leave messages on my voicemail (at my request) with very specific instructions and then would work hard to get back to me quickly if I needed to ask additional questions.The nurses were generally efficient and competent, and most were also friendly.  But it is a big staff and you did not always gets someone you felt simpatico with. Staff other than nurses were not very kind or compassionate and made my partner feel uncomfortable. They made me feel like a number rather than a person. The billing staff were particularly rude and not helpful.Nurses were kind and helpful, but I did not like not having a point person/primary nurse Nursing staff are better in person.  It's impossible to get them on the phone.  Much better off stalking them in person.I liked the nurses who did my monitoring. They were great. The nurses during and after egg retrieval were horrible. They are extremely kind...it's a big place and initially you can feel like you could get lost in the shuffle.  But they all have a smile on their faces, they are happy to see you, answer your questions and are kind & loving during the monitoring process and retrieval. It's very efficient and well run. It's busy and very popular. It can be somewhat factory like. Honestly, there is just no other efficient way to get that many people through the process. However, they always gave me the time I needed.Very knowledgable and usually compassionate. A multitude of ages and personalities. All competent, all caring. Some were better at explanations and follow through, but I did not have any negative experiences. I also liked to talk to them and show an interest in their own lives, they knew so much about me, I felt they would like someone to show an interest in what was happening in their lives. Overall great.For the most part, they have great personalities and are very thoughtful and responsive. NYU Fertility has a good schedule of opening in the morning for blood work and calling with results in the afternoon. The key is to get there right when they open in order to get in and get the blood draw done. Generally, their process is like clockwork.It was a rotating staff but everyone I spoke with knew all the details and protocols for our procedures. all the nurses were very kind.The clinic is very busy, but all the nurses handled their jobs well. All are very competent. A particular nurse, Imelda, is very kind, compassionate and caring.Good space. In my option a bit bad located. Check in is easy. I wish they had mychart active or a patience portal.                                                                                                   Efficient and always made themselves available for my questions and explaining the next steps of the process.The nursing staff is phenomenal at NYUStrengths: extremely well-organized, with cutting-edge knowledge of procedures and expertise.
Weaknesses: Sometimes it can be hard to get in touch of nurses by phone.efficent. Hours are between 6-9 the earlier you arrive the quicker. Those that come closer to 9 have a long waitIt is a bit like a factory. Lots of doctors. Lots of nurses. Very process oriented. The clinic was clean which was important . The waiting room was kind of sad, all you see are women with similar issues waiting to be seen. The wait time was rather long too which gives you too much time to think of negative things. One day, while waiting for an appt, I saw what I assumed was a past patient,  she had brought in hee baby to introduce to Dr. Keefe and the Receptionist,  that made me feel so hopeful.Well oiled machine
First come first serve between the hours of 7am-9am
Cycled you thruCompetent and quick to answer questions.  Everyone always friendly, even early in the morning when I usually went in.Lots of handwritten instructionsI really do not have a comparison because this is the only clinic that I’ve gone to, but it was a bit like “herding cattle” as it’s extreme busy and I never saw the same women in the clinic. That said, I never waited very long and everything was very professional. This clinic has a lot of experience and has worked with many, many clients so they have well developed protocols. Sometimes; however, because they do the treatments so often it becomes routine and they miss things that they should notice that do not exactly fit into their routine.The one weakness is there is no one nurse assigned to your case to followup with you. Every day a different nurse called. That being said, they were all warm and knowledgeable and always willing to help answer any questions. I never felt like I was falling through the cracksNever saw same nurse twice. Injured during ultrasound - sore for a week after. No compassion, sometimes testing done with the door open or with another attending trainee without asking for permission. Misspelled and misprounced my name. Awful experience. Individually they were nice, but there were too many patients each day.  You did not feel like you received personal service and the wait was long.N/A yetDisorganized, unfriendly. Super amazing at being available and assuring during the processNursing staff was the same each time I went in so it was comforting to see familiar faces. All were very knowledgeable and I knew I could ask anyone a question and expect a solid answer.some were better than others. some cared and expressed support and emotion. others just kept you moving onI honestly don't remember muchwell coordinated. good success rates. Psychologist who evaluates prior to IVF, etc was excellent.  Secretaries are efficient and responsive.  One thing I do not like is the new answering system that they have created, although efficient it is impersonalWonderful and very helpfulthey were compassionate and a pleasure to deal with.Monitoring from 7-9 AM. Pleasant enough waiting area.They are very busy, but the whole process runs smoothly.  You will get the best treatment and that is what is most important. The lab is one of the best in the city. Know that this is important. I recommend getting to early morning monitoring before 8:55am because otherwise you will have a wait. If you have a question, ask. A nurse will always get right back to you. They really have your best interest at heart. This is a hard process but they are all there to help you every step of the way. Well oiled machineIt was well run, a few days I had to wait longer than others, the staff was always apologetic.All of the nurses were incredibly friendly, knowledgeable, and organized.At NYU, the staff is very organized and thorough. Billing and insurance with NYU was a breeze (and honestly, it's always been a painpoint for me at other clinics). I felt that the facilities were clean, very well managed, and they ran a really tight operation. I would recommend booking your actual appointments well in advance so that you are organized and can plan accordingly. Secondly, I would recommend going to morning monitoring by 8am as it'll take 2-5 min to get in. At around 8:30 or 9am, it can take 15 - 20 min (which isn't bad, but it's helpful to plan). Lastly, I would do your homework on insurance! NYU is really good about making sure you have the information needed so make sure you listen/learn and follow up so that there are no surprises. The nurses always guided me to check with insurance on specific things (and in fact, called my insurance to confirm on my behalf many times too)The clinic is big, there are always people in the waiting room. If you want a boutique experience this is not for you. Despite its size, it is extremely well run. Signing in at the computer is arguably the only time I felt like a ""number."" I have never experienced a mishap or mistake on behalf of the clinic or a missed call etc. I didn't go through full IVF process yet, due to pandemic, but overall it seems to be organized. Human error may always happen and it's normal. I rarely have to wait too long, my insurance approval processes and billing is handled well. I had no surprises or miscommunications so far. The clinic is usually clean. They are usually organized, except  during the busy times were things can get backed up. New patients coming for morning monitoring should try to arrive at 7am or even a bit before if possible. Once you get to 8am things start to get busy and there can be some bottlenecking.This clinic has a long history of positive results and while you might not see your doctor for the iui / monitoring process, they have a very well regarded team and I still felt comfortable being in trusted hands. Sometimes you feel like a number while going through the process but I think it’s somewhat a reflection of how busy they are / the number of cases they have seen / they have had a lot of success.Strengths: organized, high volume, solid nursing staff, once you learn to navigate the clinic they are very responsive, good for cookie-cutter cases

Weaknesses: you’ll never see your doctor, you’ll get conflicting information from attending a and fellows (several doctors openly questioned my protocol), you will NOT receive personalized care. Also because they are so big, there’s not a lot of flexibility around scheduling (need to check a lot of boxes, little leeway). For me this didn’t work - my ovarian reserve is very low and my antral count varies month to month. I need to optimize my cycles around my body and not the clinic’s calendar, so switched to a smaller clinic with better results.It's NYU - and they have a great track record at getting the results that I wanted. I would recommend them for the work, but not the decor. Also the location is not easy to get to in the morning. I did hear that they might be opening more locations for bloodwork. NYU has a great team of doctors and nurses. I felt like I was in good hands and when going through IVF, you have to be able to trust the fertility clinic you have chosen. I never doubted my decision to go with NYU and I'm happy with the outcome I had with them.There should be more preparation for administering the injections. There was an orientation but I forgot everything by the time it was time to start the cycle.

It is a factory but very organized. There were times I questioned if they were tailoring my meds correctly but at the end they knew what they were doing because I got way more eggs than expected. 

 Also, need better communication regarding requirements if you ever want to donate the eggs. I was told that I had time to make the decision before retrieval and then week before the retrieval I was told that you need to start the process one month prior. Still not sure what the actual answer is for that question. Often long waits, but the clinic was very efficient getting people in and out as quick as possible. They are very organized. When you arrive, you check in with the video monitors, and wait to be called. The wait time was always minimal. You were escorted to the back room for blood work, if needed, and then into one of the rooms. They knew who you were, what you there for, and answered any questions which made you feel more like a patient than a number. While it was sometimes crowded, they clearly knew what to do and were able to make their way through each patient in a timely manner. NYU is a giant, well-oiled machine and it's hard not to feel like a number. That said, their lab is excellent and success rates for IVF are slightly higher here than at other clinics.  I would recommend going to the location on West 52nd street as much as possible and staying away from the 1st Avenue location when you can. If you have any kind of insurance coverage it's best to read all of the billing paperwork thoroughly and keep copies of everything. I was incorrectly told that I did not have coverage hit up for $500 per visit by the head of billing even when I explained otherwise. This person told me my claims had been denied and that I didn't understand my own coverage .  I found out later that she was not filing any of out claims with insurance. Eventually, I was able to get my insurance provider to send her an email explicitly stating that I was covered and my money was refunded. I want to assume that this issue was not a reflection of the institution as a whole but I did get the sense the NYU tries to make its patients pay out of pocket as much as possible. This is a very busy but very organized clinic. The nurses get you in and out for early morning blood work and the wait times are never that bad. They have a very good system. It is a bit hard to get someone one the phone quickly, but they do always return calls within the same day or next morning. I’ve had no issues with billing or authorization and they are always very quick and helpful, calling Aetna for me and helping to make the insurance process as easy as possible. They answer all of my questions and never make me feel like a bother. The one criticism would be that sometimes billing comes before all else, but that is understandable to some degree. They are very good at what they do overall, and very efficient. I like that for retrievals you don't need to be there in one cattle call, you are assigned specific times. Morning monitoring is efficient particularly when you get there early. Their check in system is very easy to use.Clean and spacious facility
Generally on time with appointments but book early because they are very popular.
You could easily feel like a number because there are so many patients in and out every day, but the staff does a great job at showing kindness and empathy, while keeping things moving along too.The clinic is one of the oldest IVF clinics in the country and has a lot of experience with IVF. It is very well organized. It provides a thorough orientation session with booklets and videos to guide you through the entire process. In fact, you cannot proceed with treatment unless you attend the orientation session, so they are very committed to educating you as a patient and informing you of all the risks and benefits. Morning monitoring can be busy, but if you get there early, you are seen quickly and efficiently. Out of pocket prices can be on the more expensive side among NYC clinics, but I think you get what you pay for. The price was worth it considering they got me an excellent result. Make sure you educate yourself. The more you know the more you can ask and understand what you can be doing to help in anyway. Google can be scary but it can also can be used to educate and ask. 
The lab closes twice a year end of July and beginning of December. This was really upsetting as no one told me this and I had my consult beginning of July. I found out when the coordinator called to schedule tests and classes...I have short cycles and missed two cycles due to the closure. Between end of August and December is only 4 cycles. For someone with “not a lot of time” this was devastating. But you have to learn to just roll with it- ivf is a long hard journey, any thing can get thrown off any day. NYU fertility is a renowned for their in-vitro success rates.  However, from the computer check in, to the check ups done by whichever doctor in practice available that day, you will begin to understand that if your case is slightly out of the norm and needs a bit of one on one, that you must go to another clinic.Gets very busy- some days feels like a factory. Check in is automated so it goes fast and smooth. What I really had trouble with that they take limited insurance. And won’t help you with submitting claims to The insurance company which most other doctors will do. Coordinators nurses and billing staff is very responsive. I have not been able to reach my doctor ever again after meeting him initially for consultation. He didn’t reply my email where I explained what has and hasn’t happened the 5 months since we initially met with him and followed his treatment protocol. We are in the process of moving forward with IVF after IUIs and I haven’t been able to get a hold of my doctor to get a roadmap for treatment so I can prepare for cost. The clinic is great. It's clean and the systems in place (ipad registration, open hours for bloods, etc) are well organized. Everything moves so quickly and efficiently. It takes me longer to get to 1st Avenue than my time actually spent in the clinic. THAT is incredible.  

My only complaint is I have no cell coverage while in the clinic. And when I log in to guest wifi I am still not connected. Seriously, my only complaint is the shoddy wifi. Not a state-of-the art clinic. Success rates, doctors, equipment were what mattered to me, but if you are looking for premium waiting rooms, 1:1 attention from your doctor during the full length of treatment, immediate responses to follow up calls, this may not be the clinic for you. The academic association of this clinic warrants a team approach, so you will have to trust the team of doctors' best practices, proven protocols, years of research and published papers. The few star doctors of the clinic will be there for you if you really need them. But you will need to be a very patient patient.

In FC NYU there are great embryologists, so if you fear your age is determining a lower quality of your eggs, you want that team looking at your embryos and performing biopsies. You also want to go for the PGS testing lab they recommend and trust their interpretation of results. 

One thing I absolutely loathed about this clinic was the billing department. Staff sitting there is misinformed, inefficient, insecure, and unprofessional. Even if you consider that dealing with any insurance is a dreadful process, the billing team should be 200% better at their jobs. Every time I know I have to deal with them, my adrenaline is through the roof. FC, please reassess billing staff + provide better ""client services"" training and make measurable improvements ASAP!NYU is a large place, and there are always many people in the waiting room.  Suffice to say, I have never once felt like a number at this clinic.  I am always greeted with a smile by my caregivers, who call me by name, and am treated with respect.  The billing process at NYU is always scary as you have to check out with full payment before you leave.  Some of those bills will bill enough to give you a coronary.  But hey let's face it - infertility treatment is prohibitively expensive no matter the clinic.  With this in mind, I am more interested in the type of quality healthcare I get for my money.  NYU has been a solid choice for us.Biggest issue is you can't get anyone on the phone.  They have an answering service where you leave a message and they call you back at their leisure and what's convenient for them.  I'm sorry, but for the money they make they could hire an actual receptionist that works for the doctor.  This has been my only experience with a fertility clinic so i don't have anything to compare it to. NYU I think is one of the larger 'factory' types of fertility clinics. And, at times I did feel that. But, that said, they do have a pretty well-oiled efficient system and I felt confident I was in good hands and that if my cycle was cancelled at any point it would not have been due to human error or balls dropped. Also, in spite of the assembly line feel at times, most of the staff (medical and administrative) I encountered were friendly and had a personality and tried to make a human connection for that brief encounter. Overall, I was impressed that everyone clearly had a sense of and respect for the difficulty & expense of this process. This was reflected in the tone of the facility and the care at each turn.There is many nurses and workers at facility. They won't remember you. They do their part. So you just show and tell your problems and they will try to fix them. There is no comfort or friendly atmosphere. If you don't want close relationship with doctor or nurse and just focusing on issues, this clinic is the best for you.The clinic is extremely large so you have to proactively manage your care and be your own advocate.  Do your research so you're prepared with your questions when you talk to your doctor or the staff.  I keep a binder with all of my lab results, protocols, Insurance forms, Financial forms, general info etc.  I have found absolutely everyone on this staff to be responsive and fabulous.At the end of the day, we chose the bustling, busy operation that is NYU Fertility over a more boutique, personalized experience because of numbers. They are exceptional against the national average in terms of FET, live births, and single births. We knew what to expect and, while it would be great to be able to call/email our doctor anytime, we have been satisfied with our decision based on results so far.After your initial consultation with your Doctor, you may see multiple other Doctors in the practice during your follow up monitoring visits, egg retrieval and embryo transfers. I felt comfortable with this practice since the visits are generally very quick. The clinic is great.  The only issue is that you see a different doctor everyday and that the appointments check-ins can be tough.  There were a couple billing issues and the billing situation was very difficult to navigate.My experience at NYU was pleasant. Wait times were not long and the clinic was not super crowded. The nurses have a good eye as they were able to catch things my previous RE didn't catch. They are all very patient even when I called many times.  The staff at the clinic are friendly and upbeat and are generally good about being efficient. They are great about calling roughly when they say they will. Not as much personal attention as I would like because I have multiple health issues. If you are considering IUI, there is one nurse who i think is much better at it than the others but that might just be a personal preference. Be prepared to show up closer to 6:45 a.m. if you want to get in and out of monitoring fast. If you come later, definitely longer waits, especially if you need an ultrasound, too. Definitely be proactive and make sure to communicate with your doctor as much as you are comfortable doing. You must be proactive. I have not been to other clinics so I don't know how this one compares. Different parts of the clinic could get on the same page about protocols.  Seems like the patient coordinator and nursing staff weren't always communicating the same things - for example, when I can start my FET cycle while waiting my PGS results - patient coordinator said no, nurses said yes - that caused confusion.  Some of the preliminary lab test (infectious disease panel bloodwork) fell through the cracks so I had to re-do them.  Embryology lab messed up by telling the nurse 26 eggs were retrieved when in fact only 14 eggs were retrieved (26 was the incubator number).  And finance and billing weren't always the most responsive.  Anesthesiology messed up one of our bills.  

One thing I wished NYU Fertility could have provided is some type of counseling prior to the process and during the process.  I'm not talking about psychological support - because they had that, and frankly, we found unhelpful.  What I'm talking about is someone who was willing to walk us through what to expect in terms of the various decisions we would have to make, how to think through how many rounds, whether and how to make the tough decision on transferring mosaic embryos, how to manage pregnancy loss, when to call it quits, and someone we can provide feedback to directly (and not just some on-line survey after every procedure), etc.  Not just what to expect from a medical perspective, but the impact IvF, FET and mosaic transfers may have emotionally, financially, etc. Someone who acts as an advocate for the patient.  At this time, the nurse, patient coordinator, genetic counselor combined fill that role in limited capacities.  But as patient, we had to seek that out and connect the dots ourselves.  Perhaps this is a resource beyond the clinic's capacity, but that would have been helpful.It is a busy clinic. It's like the DMV. Take a number and you will be called. Packed to the gills!NYU is top center. It may have been overwhelming for us if it was the first stop on our fertility journey. By the time we got to NYU, we were reassured to be in a place with top doctors and labs, and were fine with not having the amenities of a concierge practice. If you are just starting out and using NYU it may be more challenging, though I would still recommend them. We had a consult in another top clinic, and we found NYU to be a lot more caring and small-feel despite its prominence.The clinic is well organized however, because it is big, there are sometimes miscommunications especially between the medical team and accountability. I would advise to take the time to sit down with one of the accountants to discuss with them the financial side of the treatment and have them fully inquire about your medical coverage. I wish I had a better understanding of my coverage when I started. I think I would have made slightly different medical decisions.Dr. Grifo's assistance was extremely nice and helpful! Everyone else was nice, as well. The only issue was the wait time for monitoring was often pretty long. Although you may feel like you're just one of too many, once you see someone they are very nice and always answer questions. Billing was helpful, as well.Despite the size and being part of an academic institution, I never felt like a number at NYU. My treatments were so customized and the Drs and nurses so personal, I felt like they really knew me. The technology was also great; iPads to sign in quickly, online secure emails and online videos to help w/ injections. They are incredibly efficient and very good at communicating.  Even though there are a lot of appointments (bloodwork, ultrasounds, etc.) they get you in and out quickly and you get your results in a very timely manner.  You might feel like a number at times, but they are efficient and they successfully got me pregnant.I thought that the clinic felt like a total factory- I think that if you want to go in and get IVF then thats what they do- thats what they are comfortable doing. That said you will not have a personal relationship with your doctor- it is a big place and you will be thrown into the system- you will deal with a different person each time that you go in- if your ok with that then you should go for it- that sort of attitude was not for me- I had some doctors who were cold and not helpful and did not explain things to me and made me feel dumb about questions or scheduling etc. My actual doctor on the other hand was great when I could arrange a time to meet wither her ( they did not encourage in person but rather phone calls) I was never able to email her directly only thru her assistant which I found insulting and found that other friends of mine did not have that experience at other clinics.  Their phone system was bonkers and  it was rare to have a person at the clinic pick up the phone instead you have to go thru this long phone system and call center to leave a message- then when they would finally leave a message it would be from a non working number that you could not call back and then would have to call the service again and wait another 3 hours-Like a factory; limited interaction with doctors.  Not for those who need their hand held.  However, well oiled machine that seems to be working well.To check in during morning monitoring hours, you check in at a computer. I actually like this set-up, but some people think its impersonal. I did not mind and actually thought it was quite efficient. NYU is a large clinic, and I know that many people feel like they're just a number.  My attitude is the clinic is large for a reason - it's one of the best clinics in the area, perhaps the country.  I typically visited the 52nd St location, which is much smaller, and I was able to get to know the staff there.  When I visited the main location on 1st Ave, it was definitely busy, but it's run like a well-oiled machine.  NYU is a world-class facility. I personally don't care if it feels like a farm or you're treated as a number – they have a lot of people to get through, and all I care about is that they're effective and successful, which they are. I would recommend anyone to NYU.The location is a bit of a pain - all the way on 1st Ave - but otherwise great.  A large waiting room that is usually pretty empty.  The staff is lovely and it's all well organized.  Because it is part of NYU all the outside testing and procedures are done within a few blocks and there is no added time to schedule things, get test back, etc. The clinicians have a lot of experience and know their stuff.   But if you are looking for a place where you receive emotional support,  this may not be the place for you.  I did not need it as I had no issues.  I froze my eggs.  I had twenty seven eggs in one cycle.  When I wanted to get pregnant, I was successful on the first try.  I will say that Dr Noyes assistant, Jarlin, is really nice and caring.  strengths: cutting edge medicine, staff that could never be outdone, environment that is comforting

weaknesses: unfortunately they are located on a busy side of Manhattan so the outside atmosphere is hustle and bustle, and the total opposite of the inside... this is in no way a reflection on the clinic/staff.... just a reality to the future patients that go there that you need a plan for parking for monitoring and other time consuming visits.Well oiled machine. Excellent doctors and nursing staff. The only area that I wouldn't rate a 10 is the billing staff. Had to follow up when I had questions about insurance, etc. NYU is huge and you have to be proactive at times to get the communication you need. But the doctors and resources are tremendous.Visit windows were 7 - 9 am, so convenient for me. If you needed to get in quickly, you could arrive before 7 am and be seen very soon. Not too crowded, efficient process.NYU is affiliated with a teaching hospital and presumably has a commensurate lab, so that provides comfort.  But it is impersonal.  Impersonal is ok for the dentist's office, but not a fertility clinic.  I wound up leaving to go to a smaller, more personalized clinic where my treatment felt more tailored and where I had a name.Strengths: their medicine is top notch. It's NYU they have laboratory resources that is bar none. They have experience with so many various cases so they are extremely knowledgeable and have top of the line recourses. Weskness: they are not personable. In order to speak to someone you have to leave a message with a call center and they will call you back. The lines for monitoring are long and the IVF coordinators and billing have attitudes. A little crowded in the waiting room - but just because their team is the best and had big write ups in recent news. I saw FIVE friends in the waiting room during the course of my treatment. That was weird. The clinic clean and efficient. Definitely knew what they were doing but it was always packed.I really like the no appointment, two-hour window in the morning for the blood draws.  But sometimes there are problems/back-ups and you never know when you will have one of those mornings when everyone shows up at the same time and you have to wait quite a while.  So be prepared to wait and perhaps be late for work if that is where you are going next.  Very modern. From signing in to leaving from blood work it was never more then 30 minutes.  Everything is at the facility from counseling, bloodwork, sonos and transfer.  Cant think of any weaknesses. This is a busy, first rate clinic. I felt I was in excellent hands and loved knowing the entire team and best-in-class equipment and procedures were dedicated to round the clock care. Like any NYC practice, you will need to be your own advocate and ask questions if you missed something, but I felt very well cared for.The clinic gets good results which is the most important thing.  However, it does feel like a factory with so many people going in and out of the clinic and meeting different doctors and different nurses each time you visit the clinic.Strengths: top talent, eminent research and treating physicians, deep bench, efficient protocols. Weaknesses:  big place, big staff, standardization can make certain aspects of treatment feel cookie-cutter.  Also, they were constantly asking for money up front.  I know the process is expensive, and I know insurance often doesn't cover it, or doesn't cover much, but sometimes I felt like NYU was more interested in my wallet than my womb.   NYU is organized, high tech, and although some people describe it like a “factory” I never felt like a number. It does run like a well oiled machine, but can be very crowded during the monitoring times. They do their best to accommodate your schedule, which is much appreciated. The one thing that is lacking at this clinic is that it's not 100% on the NYU MyChart system yet, so it's not very easy or intuitive to access test results or to communicate electronically with staff or the physician. Otherwise, things run very smoothly there! It felt like a cattlecall most times.Call administrators provided incorrect information regarding hours of operation. I drove and hour on Christmas eve morning only to find out the office was closed despite being told the day before that the clinic was open. The on call doctor was available through phone and was able to direct me to Columbia to complete bloodwork. It was a hectic couple of hours. Nice facility. Compassionate staff but can feel a bit like a factory with many many patients and fairly impersonal process. Monitoring hours are 7-9 am, and if you arrive close to 9 am it could take a very long time. May see a different doctor at every visit.Strengths - they have experience and see a high volume of patients so probably know each and every possible case or explanation.  Weaknesses - very little doctor content, feels like a factory, nurses and billing are impossible to get on the phone.  You will call 4 times, and every time they will say you will hear a response in by end of day, and you do not. It gets extremely frustrating on top of everything else that goes along with this process.Ugly, inconvenient offices. Billing is on top of things when they want your money but not so much when you have questions or need a refund. The monitoring works like clockwork. Sometimes feels a bit overwhelming when you walk in and see a large waiting room filled with people.  But it moves smoothly and they're prompt to see you, call w bloodwork/medication info and they make everything as easy as possible.  Strength in numbers- very busy clinic means they have the experience and resources. All staff were very knowledgable, everything was very well organized.
Two weaknesses were one incident of poor communication regarding shipment of medication and their billing department- unorganized and difficult to reach by phone.  The facility, I felt,  was private and the nurses took care of you. The billing was the billing, who likes to hand over $10K, but the billing staff was pleasant and provided me with what I needed.  Overall good, just conservative in their approach to using IVF.  If you are older and have financial flexibility, get a 2nd opinion from RMA asap.  They refused to do an IVF cycle based on low FSH.  However, we feel, that at age 42, we likely wasted 4 months waiting for a lower FSH level.  I would suggest going to get a 2nd opinion asap in the  process if you don't progress asap.So so busy and not as efficient as RMA. You will wait a long time for monitoring. Nurses are super nice. When you call you don’t get a person - you get a machine. But at least dr grifo has an assistant that is very helpful and responsive. It isike any other clinic in that you need to get there early for monitoring. Results come back quickly. My only complaint is the billing department. One doesn’t know what the other one is doing and you have to call several times to resolve any issues. Strengths: highly efficient and organized, flexible with changing protocol if necessary, offering a selection of pharmacies to get meds. Always clean and professional. 

Weakness: fast paced office with time for shorter conversations only. They want to get you in an out (this is also a strength depending on your point of view.) i felt more like a number at the clinic than a patient.  the staff was sweet but you felt like they were trying to get everyone in and out in a timely manor.  they would call your name, take your blood, get examined by the dr on call and you would be out before you blinked an eye.  The clinic can feel like a factory and you're just a number.Strengths: Experience, efficiency, availability
Weaknesses:  Rotating Dr's every time you go in for an apt.I had mild OHSS post treatment.  There are medications that can be given to diminish this (ganirelex or cetrotide for a few days).  While the other clinics I have been to were willing to provide that, NYU will not, which makes the recovery time much more prolonged and difficult.Very easy, usually a wait of less than 20 minutes.It was mostly a well oiled machine but I did have an emergency once where I was injured and worried about the pregnancy. They saw me immediately and my doctor made sure to see me as well. Very very early morning monitoring which I hated but it was necessary or id. e late for work all the time.Very efficient and professional - checkin with iPads, quick and easy - never a long wait.  Staff helpful and friendly.Easy to make appointment and easy checkin but inconvenient location. Waiting room is normal doctors office style. Very easy to schedule bloodwork, semen testing, etc and they are very accommodating. Overall I recommend!The clinic's strengths is their success with live births.   The clinic's weaknesses are their lack of organization and the lack of ease of the process.  Access to the office is difficult even when you are an existing patient.Monitoring was done in the mornings and the wait times varied at different points.Quick and efficientIt’s a cattle call. Expect to wait 2-3 hours for your monitoring appointments. Impersonal. Unless you’re ready for IVF this isn’t the place for you. I can’t think of many upsides for NYU as I had a generally terrible experience. The clinic was too big, it was like a baby factory.  You had to wait in a big waiting room with no privacy for up to an hour sometimes.  It was an embarrassing and difficult environment.Clean, not crowded, comfortable. Felt expensive yet professionalThe clinic is very reputable and professional with the exception of the receptionishtNYU is a large clinic with small satellite offices. There are many doctors on staff and I selected mine based on online reviews. The clinic is connected to the hospital so billing for various procedures is very streamlinedvery busy, but well organized. it's a big clinic. morning hours from 7-9.I loved it there. However after switching to Cornell I feel on a larger scale Cornell has a better labI went first thing in the morning. Hours were convenient.  Very efficient, was able to always leave clinic and be on time for work.  It is a first come first served process so getting there before the doors open is recommendedI'm confident in the science and success rates of the clinic.  However, it mostly operates a lot like a factory. There are often long lines and long waits for all the processes.  It's not a great feeling clinic.smooth running team.  the worked well together and got you in and out quickly in the morning.I found the clinic to e very organized and well run. The open hours for labs/US could get crowded and you might wait for 15-20 minutes, but this was the same as the practice where I was seen first, so I wasn't surprised. A lot of women in the waiting room, if you show up at the very end of monitoring hours you will wait for sure. But once you put your name into the system that you arrived, you will be called in turn (usually within 20 minutes at the very longest) and from there it is a well oiled machine.  You get to know all the doctors and PA's that are doing the sonograms and you know all the nurses drawing blood. I always took a cab so I would arrive by 7am on the dot in order to not have to wait so long that I would be late to work. I  provided some of my thoughts on a previous question. I felt this was a very efficient process. Obviously there was some waiting on some days, but nothing significant. Monitoring was from 7-9am 7 days a week. I am sure exceptions could be made if needed but I never needed to request this. It would be crowded but I always arrived before 7 and was one of the first patients to be seen. I actually appreciated the set up of a morning monitoring window because I could get in and out before starting my workday and get my results/instructions before the end of the day.Monitoring appointments were first come, first serve from 7am to 10am. The earlier you went, the faster you could be seen. I personally liked the flexibility of having a walk-in appointment over making an appointment for a specific time. Efficient well-oiled machine. Nurses are very personable despite the scale of the clinic. Well-mannered, up beat, rain or shine, as early as 7.30 on a holiday. They are GREAT!It was well orchestrated for sure. I was never there for longer than felt appropriate for what needed to happen that visit. It was not perfect (first couple times, it wasn't clear who I was seeing for the ultra sounds (a doctor, my doctor, a tech?) or what they were looking for with the first couple visits) but I advocated for myself and if asked for more info immediately got it & the nurse realized she had been too quick.Well oiled machine.  Check in at computers up front and wait to be called.  Blood taken first then sent to room for the ultrasound.  I always get there early and am in and out in no time.There are a LOT of people doing morning monitoring at NYU Fertility right now. If you arrive at the tail end of a particularly busy day (9am, as opposed to coming closer to 7am) you could be there for 45 minutes. But the staff and operations there are generally very efficient and have everything down to a science.I was happy with the monitoring appointments as they were from 7am to 9am and easy and quick to get to before work. It was somewhere in between.  It can get very busy and take a lot of time.  Once we learned to ""game"" the system and show up early or late it was better.It went relatively smoothly when I was able to be there by 6:45 a.m. Hours don't start till 7 a.m. but like everything in NYC, people get there early and start to line up. When I really needed some sleep and went in a little later, different story. Also, the nurses would ask me for my allergies and what medications I was taking each time even though it was in the computer. I started carrying a list. I think all they cared about was latex but if you have a long list of allergies that you yourself can't remember, it's frustrating to have to recite it every other day. Then sometimes the doctor would make a change of protocol and I wouldn't know why or know that I needed to have my partner there with me for consent forms. It sometimes went flawlessly, other times, not at all so.Morning monitoring was open without appointments between 7 AM and 9 AM. For the most part, that seemed fair and reasonable.  NYU was good about not having to bring you in unnecessarily.  One advice to future patients is if you're going in only for blood work, see if you can move up the queue, because I often waited a long time unnecessarily just to give one vile of blood.  You get mixed in with the rest of the patients waiting for ultrasounds.   A cattle call. So many women there waiting for labs and sono. Very busy!I went about an hour into the monitoring hours, after the morning rush but before the latecomers. I don't think I waited more than 15 minutes any morning. Very efficient.7-9am.  If you get there early, you should be seen within 15-30 minutes.  Restrictive hours, though.My job and home schedule is flexible. I found the monitoring hours (early morning) totally manageable. Weekends were more crowded, but sometimes I was seen right away. I was fine with it.There were a lot of people, but it ran like a well-oiled machine. You could go anytime between 7 and 9am, which was nice for some flexibility, but the later you got there, the longer the wait would be. If you arrived during the first half hour, there was basically no wait.You had to go in between 7-9;00 am in the morning.  I suppose if I had an issue,  I could have asked for a special appointment.  But I did not have occasion to. Extremely efficient. The only time I had to wait longer than 5 minutes was the day after a big snowstorm. Otherwise, i was always in and out within 15-20 minutes. they do rely on the fellows a lot though. During my IUIs, I was only monitored once by an attending and during IVF monitoring, I'd say it was 50/50. But the fellows took more time with me and were more thorough in answering my questions. Monitoring is an efficient cattle-call. I loved being in and out before work. When I moved out of the area and traveled in for a cycle they accommodated me during non-monitoring hours when it was mor convenient for me.It was a window of time. If you get there early it's quick but if you get there late you'll be waiting a long time. It was first come first serve so some patients got competitive and catty Totally well-oiled machine but definitely packed. Never had a problem though and nurses were great at blood taking which is a huge pain.The clinic was open between 7am and 9am which made it very convenient with work.  For the most part, the wait was about 15 minutes.  The clinic ran fairly smoothly.Pretty efficient. No complaints except that all the monitoring is annoying. Rather efficient...not terrible waiting times, to be expected.  Depended on the day, I was taken in the order I got there. Sometimes there was a line, sometimes not. I tried to get there early and get in and out. pretty goodMorning monitoring took place from 7am-9am. Could be seen before work. There were a lot of women waiting but it was organized.Monitoring is 7-9 am. I go early so I'm in and out in 20 minutes. Very efficient and the Dr's were mostly great to work with.Efficient and not unpleasant, although assembly lineElectronic check-in works wellthere were set monitoring hours and would make sure to go early to beat any waits.",8.0,8.199999999999994,"You do feel a bit like a number in a factory. Billing is straightforward for the most part, however those on the staff who are responsible for processing pre-authorizations of insurance are not the most responsive always -- you need to be persistent at times to get the information you need. The system seems kind of random after you check in though I'm sure there's a method to their madness. The practice is large and runs like a well oiled machine. Although I really liked my physician, you rarely see or speak to your main physician. I would definitely recommend this centerIt is a busy clinic and you don't see your doctor every visit, but she checked in frequently and made all of my plans. The nurses before and after my egg retrieval and FET were very kind and professional as well. The nursing staff is very knowledgeable when calling with questions. It was a rotating staff but everyone I spoke with knew all the details and protocols for our procedures. And won’t help you with submitting claims to The insurance company which most other doctors will do. With this in mind, I am more interested in the type of quality healthcare I get for my money. While the other clinics I have been to were willing to provide that, NYU will not, which makes the recovery time much more prolonged and difficult. The open hours for labs/US could get crowded and you might wait for 15-20 minutes, but this was the same as the practice where I was seen first, so I wasn't surprised. I actually appreciated the set up of a morning monitoring window because I could get in and out before starting my workday and get my results/instructions before the end of the day."
18,NYU Langone Fertility Center,protocol,"Unexplained fertility on our part, so we tried 4 IUI's (1 natural, 3 with clomid) which all failed.  This time around we are doing our first IVF with frozen transfer, and I was put on follistim, menopur and cetrotide with lupron trigger.  I was responding very well to the medications (estradiol to ~5,000), so the dosage was taken down over the stimulation period. In my first cycle, I was on the cusp of having retrieval a day sooner or later. Dr. Hodes opted for later and thus 3 of the 20 eggs I got were ""over baked""; however, 3 were still under baked. In the second cycle, I was ready for retrieval two days sooner than the first, so I got less hormones and a better result of freeing 18 eggs out of 23 retrieved. I am not sure if my body just produced better the second time, or Dr. Hodes used her learnings from the first time to make the second time more efficient.

02/20/10 - Retrieval - 22 eggsWe used IUI three cycles. IUI with injections one cycle and an IVF cycle.With any fertility treatment, there are so many emotions. Try to not get too wrapped up and trust them. Maybe I was lucky because things went according to plan, but there were times I didn't see her and I was ok with that. It didn't bother me but I know it bothered other people. I trusted that things were going according to plan and Dr. Fino did not disappoint. Don't rememberI don't rememberOne of my biggest issues was the timing of ovulation as my cycles varied widely month by month. We started out by monitoring my cycles and doing a trigger shot. The first cycle, we learned that my follicles were not growing big enough by the time I ovulated, so for the next cycle, Shannon gave me Clomid to help with the follicle process. Although my body reacted well to Clomid, the first IUI was unsuccessful. The next month, I tried Clomid again but this time my body had a strange reaction to the medication and I had really bad cramps post ovulation. As a result, Shannon decided to pivot and put me on Letrazole instead. I really appreciated this pivot because I knew that Shannon was listening to me and not pushing me down a path (Clomid) that I wasn't comfortable with. In addition, that next month was Christmas and I already had plans to travel and see my family. She knew this was important to me so rather than doing a timed IUI (and having me cancel my plans), I took Letrazole and had sex normally (using ovulation sticks). When this didn't work, the next month, she suggested we try Letrazole + IUI again and simultaneously prepare to start IVF. She was extra careful and thoughtful about monitoring me during this time as she knew my ovulation could be pretty erratic. 4-5 days after my period, she had me come in for morning monitoring and found out I was surging. She told me right away, and then cleared her calendar so that we could do the IUI that afternoon instead of waiting another day. I probably talked to her 3 times on the phone that day to make the decision to do IUI right then -- and I'm so grateful I did!

At the same time, we were also preparing to potentially start IVF. Shannon spent so much time walking us through the process, explaining the medications, and the most cost effective solutions. She mapped out every step and scenario (we had so many questions!!). And then... in a crazy turn of events, the DAY BEFORE we were supposed to start IVF, I found out that I was pregnant! While we never went down the IVF path, I would have felt 100% comfortable if we did. 

In the first 7 weeks of pregnancy, she monitored me to ensure everything was going smoothly and even was there to show me the first heart beat! 




First retrieval cycle we did 150 Follistim, 150 Menopur. I had 13 eggs, 11 fertilized with ICSI. Did a fresh transfer and PGS tested the balance. Got 2 PGS normal embryos and 1 Mosaic.  After failed fresh transfer we did an endometrial biopsy that was positive for Chronic Endometritis.  Took months to treat that, once it cleared I did two frozen transfers that both resulted in chemical pregnancies.  The first frozen transfer was done with Estrace and an autoimmune protocol that included Prednisone, Plaquenil and IVIG.  The second FET was a natural cycle transfer with autoimmune protocol as well.  
This current retrieval cycle I am doing 300 Follistim, 150 Menopur and Letrozol. My IVF treatment should start after the pandemic, hopefully, so I have nothing to say on that front. I did 3 IUIs and too Clomid. I responded well to it and had 2-4 eggs each cycle. I decided to cancel 4 egg cycle, even though the doctor didn't insist on cancelling. I didn't want to take the risk.1st transfer- natural cycle- did not work. She suggested Receptiva, it was a very mild positive result so then she had me take Lupron, which made me feel extremely depressed and I would never want to take it again. My second transfer was a medicated cycle and was not successful. My next transfer has been put on hold for COVID-19,  but we would have tried using baby asprin/blood thinners/mild steroids.We have done 4 IUI cycles which included clomid for 5 days, a ovidrel trigger shot and a IUI. IUI cycle - Letrozole (one follicle, no pregnancy)

IVF cycle - “mild” dose antagonist protocol with estrogen prime
- protocol: estrogen patch + ganirelix prime; 150 iu follistim + clomid, ganirelix (17 days of stims), ovidrel trigger
- result: cancelled cycle, recruited one follicle, still intended to retrieve (DOR, poor prognosis) but ovulated after trigger / shortly before retrievalUnfortunately I do not have access to the paperwork - but I could supply this later. (First transfer was with Ovidrel, second was a natural cycle) I was on a gonadotropin PGS/PGD Protocol. I started with Gonal F 225 and Menopur 150 for the first 6 days. On the 7th day I was instructed to add Cetrotide in the morning in addition to  Gonal F 225 and Menopur 150 at night. On day 11, I took the Cetrotide injection in the morning and the trigger shot that night which was a combination of Ovidrel and Lupron. Retrieval day was a day later and 34 eggs were retrieved. 25 were mature, 20 fertilized via ICSI and 11 made it to day 5 for biopsy for PGD & PGS testing and freezing.  I did not have many side effects during the stimulation cycle except that my lower abdomen felt very sore on both sides. I was extremely bloated 2 days after the egg retrieval and definitely had to take it easy. I felt completely back to normal 2 weeks after retrieval. We started out with 150 Gonal F in the morning and 75 Menapur at night  and then we decreased Gonal F dosage by the end of week one. Total cycle lasted 10 days. Results were 22 eggs retrieved. 20 frozen (but 2 were not fully mature but they froze them anyway). I did a cycle at RMA where I was on 150 of Gonal F and 150 of Menopur. Dr. Grifo studied my results and ordered me to double that protocol and do 300 of each. He also added Clomid to my protocol. These changes helped me produce more eggs. We used a series of injections to stimulate egg production/growth. I  was then monitored regularly to ensure the right dose/frequency and monitor progress. These injections included daily doses of gonal, a few of lupron, and then an ovulation stimulator to ensure ovulation occurred. I was also put on estragen to help encourage a healthy uterine lining for the transfer. During the retrieval process, we retrieved 28 eggs, however, the nurse suggested we use ICSI, to help ensure fertilization given my husbands sperm numbers, were just slightly under the amount they wanted. After the transfer, I was put on progesterone and estrogen to help support the pregnancy. When our first transfer failed, Dr. Grifo suggested a biopsy of my uterine lining to test for bacteria which could have influenced the transfer. It came back negative so he told us to move forward with another transfer. This time around, Dr. Grifo suggested that we might want to try something different just for our peace of mind. So we tried a natural cycle without the use of estrogen and just the use of letrazole. However, after my first visit, Dr. Grifo didn't really like that I  wasn't progressing and decided to put me back on the same cycle we tried before as it seemed to work better.  It did, and that is what got us to our second transfer with Dr. Grifo! After that transfer, he  put me back on the progesterone shots and estrogen, however, after I  told him that the shots were making me really sore, he offered my progesterone inserts to help alleviate some of the shots. I have PCOS and do not ovulate on my own. Dr. Hodes started our first cycle with timed intercourse and a low dose of Letrozole. I did not respond to the Letrozole  at all (even when the dosage was raised) or to Clomid during out next cycle. At that point, Dr. Hodes recommend my partner and I move straight to IVF. I was hesitant about this choice  for many reasons and after meeting with Dr. Hodes for another consultation, she agreed to let us try IUI with a very low dose of Gonal-F injectables. (Dr. Hodes kept me at a low dose due to concerns about OHSS.) I responded well to the Gonal-F and did not over produce. We completed one IUI but unfortunately the cycle was not successful. My partner and I have decided to begin IVF next month rather than trying another IUI. All of my tests came back great, however my husband had slightly low motility. We wanted to start slow so our first cycle we tried natural IUI which Dr Licciardi was very supportive of since I have no discovered issues ovulating. After that failed we moved to Chlomid, followed by two more rounds using injectables. After 4 failed rounds I decided to see an acupuncturist and get my body and mind back in shape I order to start IVF. My cycles are on the shorter side which may be causing an issue with implantation. My acupuncturist and I are working together to correct that and it’s working! I’ll be starting IVF in May with a protocol of 150 Gonal F and 150 menopur to start. Dr Grifo learned from my past protocol with someone else that I needed an adjustment to my protocols. In addition to menopur and gonal F we added Clomid. In my prior cycle with another dr just menopur and gonal f resulted in a cancelled cycle. Dr. Grifo adding the clomid resulted in retrieving 5 eggs, which was more than even when I did a stimulation round several years ago when I was younger.Honestly can't remember the specifics...I used gonadal F, menopur and ovidrel for the egg retrieval and freezing. 150 menupur 
300 gonal 
Ovidrel to suppress 
Lupron trigger shot (2 to trigger) 
Everyday this was the protocol there was no adjustments. 
Produced 8 follicles, 5 mature. Fantastic results for someone with amh of .008the 3 rounds went pretty much the same.  Gonal F + Menapure was always on the list with the same dosage indicated.  the one time i showed better results was when Lupron was added for few days.  Clomid x2 a day- day 3-7
Ovidrel day 131) Testing everything: all bloods, genetic testing, mammogram, cancer genetic testing, donor counseling (SO IMPORTANT), Hysteogram (spelling?, but the fallopian tube test), sperm donor genetic testing. Once everything was good, then IUIs.

2) First attempt: 100 mg of Clomid, day 3 of cycle to day 7. Then u/s and bloods, three follicles (19, 20 and 22mm), trigger shot. Return next day for IUI. Negative pregnancy.

Second attempt: 100 mg of Clomid, day 3 of cycle to day 7. Then u/s and bloods, three follicles (17, 23, 24mm), trigger shot Ovidrel. Bloods one week later to test progesterone, result ""as perfect as can be."" Return next day for IUI. Negative pregnancy.

Third attempt: will follow protocol, after a one cycle break.
Gonal F, Menopur, Cetrotide and Lupron + HCG triggers. My body responded very well to drug stimulation, and all along, doses of Gonal F and Menopur were being adjusted by doctors so my follicles had time to mature appropriately. Cetrotide was taken to prevent early ovulation, and my triggers consisted of 2 days of Lupron and 1 day of HCG, at 36 and 24hrs prior to retrieval. Triggers are to be shot at specific times, so that generates a little anxiety, especially if you have to excuse yourself from a client meeting for a few minutes :( 
My 1st cycle produced 20+ eggs and 2nd cycle 20+ eggs again. Quality is very different from quantity, so if you can, PGS will give you a good reality check and ensure a lower miscarriage/bad surprises rate. 
I don't have final results yet as I'm still waiting on 2nd cycle results (1st one yielded 1 euploid embryo that is currently frozen).Because of my age, Dr. Berkeley felt it was imperative to get started on a treatment course quickly.  Unfortunately, my diminished ovarian reserve resulted in two failed IVF cycles, which were heartbreaking to us.  When we were ready, Dr. Berkeley recommended that our best option would be donor egg treatment. We did not feel like he was pushing us against our will, or trying to 'sell' us on something.  It took us awhile, but we felt very comfortable with the decision we made to work with him to accomplish our goal using donor egg as our next step.  NYU is also really on top of making sure you not only understand what is going on in your cycle treatment, but also helping you through every step in the process, either with phone calls or emails. From day one she wanted me to do IVF.  However after my persistence, She put me on clomid for an IUI and it sped up my cycle too quickly and I missed the iui opportunity (because I ovulated on like day 5!).  So we lost 2 months because of this.  Then she switched me to letrizole which made my cycle a normal 30 days but still no luck with the iui. I am just about to have my retrieval (tomorrow) so unclear yet how things will go in terms of a successful cycle or not. This is my first IVF cycle but in talking with others, I think what I was on was very typical. Menopur 300, gonal-f 300 - daily for 8 days w/ antagonist Centrotide last 3-4 (?) days. Ovadril trigger shot. I am old to be trying this (45) but my hormones and all that can be tested leading up to this indicated it was still a possibility, though a long shot (Dr Noyes was clear about this but also not hopeless).She told me I might have PCOS. But not quite sure. I've tried letrozole 2.5mg for first IUI. Then increased dose to 7.5mg at 4th IUI till 6th.
I 've tried clomid one time. I have unexplained infertility. So her strategy was normal treatment that increase dose of letrozole. IUI protocol:  letrozal (for PCOS) 

First Egg Retrieval:  Gonal F (150), Menopur (150) both tapered down to 75 toward end of stimulation, Cetrotide

First Transfer Cycle:  Estrace (2 mgs, 4 mgs, 6 mgs), Progesterone 1.5cc

First cycle Vitamins/Medicines: 750 mg Metformin, 600 mg CoQ10, 800 mg Folic Acid, 2,000 mg Vitamin D3

After failed transfer Dr. Fino performed a saline sonogram to look for fibroids and/or endometriosis and an endometrial biopsy.  The biopsy found Endometritis.  Husband and I were treated with strong course of 2 antibiotics for 2 weeks.

Second Egg Retrieval:  Gonal F (150), Menopur (150) both tapered down to 75 toward end of stimulation, Cetrotide.  During this retrieval Dr. Masbou performed a follow up endometrial biopsy or scratch to both confirm Endometritis was cleared and at the recommendation of Dr. Jonathan Scher (reproductive immunologist).

Second Transfer Cycle: Includes protocols from Dr. Jonathan Scher (reproductive immunologist as well). Estrace (2 mgs, 4 mgs, 6 mgs), Progesterone 1.5cc, Baby Aspirin (81 mg), Lovenox (0.6mL), Intralipid 20%

Second cycle Vitamins/Medicines: 1500 mg Metformin, VitaCare (prescribed prenatal), 600 mg CoQ10, 1.4 mg Folic Acid (Metanx), 4,000 mg Vitamin D3, Fem-Dophilus pro-biotic, 400 mg Magnesium Citrate, Prednisone (15 mg per day), Synthroid (25 mg)We had completed an unsuccessful IUI with my wife's OBGYN and, given her age (almost 41) decided to move straight into IVF. With Dr Fino we timed my  wife's cycle, started with the injection therapy, and did a retrieval. We are waiting to see how many viable embryos there are after day 5/6. Then the plan is to do PGS (at an outside lab) and frozen embryo transfer.  Dr. Hodes-Wertz found that I had a blocked tube and suggested a Salpingectomy in order to avoid complications with getting pregnant. She performed the surgery and I recovered so quickly that I was able to be up and about the next day. She also suggested genetic and PGS testing, which I carried through with and gave me peace of mind when I got pregnant and also when I had a PProm because I could rule out genetic factors from being the cause. She skipped IUI and went directly to retrieval.  The issue we had was a shortage of eggs, so she was realistic and didnt want to waste our time and money.

During the second retrieval she changed one of the meds and our result was not as good, so she quickly changed course for the third retrieval and our result was better.

She also advised to do a frozen transfer as the technology was such that it would increase the genetic screening and increase our chances for an ultimate live birth.

She also said she highly recommended only a single transfer as we did a frozen transfer and there was no need to to do multiples as we already know the embryo is viable, rather than the 40-50% chance of a viable embryo transfer.I did 1 Letrizole IUI cycle with ovadril, I produced 2 follicles 1 large the other smaller. Unfortunately it resulted in a negative pregnancy test. He used Letrizole to try something different because I had 3 failed clomid IUI. He also re-tested my platelet count because they appeared to be slightly below the norm. I was very happy they caught the low platelet count because when I was at RMA they missed it. His nurses were reviewing my records from RMA and noticed this low platelet count. I went to a hematologist and turned out to be the platelets were not such a big issue.For the egg freezing/retrieval I think he went to highest dose on everything because of my age and other health issues. I was at first freezing eggs as a single woman (with my first doctor, not Licciardi) then embryos with partner for future use (with Licciardi) and eventually thawed the eggs I'd frozen with another doctor (now working with Licciardi) to make those into embryos and did 2 cycles of FET using the eggs from my youngest age. He had me on progesterone shots for one FET cycle, with estradiol pills, even though my cycle is very regular; I was never sure why. And I was on progesterone suppositories for the second FET cycle, no estradiol. I don't remember the egg freezing exactly as it was a few years ago but it was some combination of Gonal-F and Follistim and ovidrel. I know I didn't do the medication that you have to mix together at home when i did the cycle for freezing with him. I'm not really sure of his rationale for the egg freezing --  I guess it's the usual protocol he starts with then adjusts if it doesn't work? For the FET I also didn't know why we were using estradiol when estrogen always normal and I ovulate on my own. Second cycle of FET we tried suppositories because of the pain at my injection site. Also would only transfer one embryo at a time because he said was big risk in having multiples and did NOT recommend PGD or any other biopsy pre implantation. I think he said because egg quality was good. I did have an IUI with letrozole days 3-7 (was supposed to be days 5-9 but there was a miscommunication re what day my period actually started). Also used trigger shot in the morning about 27 hours before IUI. I got pregnant but miscarried around 9 weeks (I had been transferred to OB after heartbeat.) Went back for another IUI two months after miscarriage; not successful. For the first three ovulation inductions, he prescribed 225 Follistim or Gonal F, 150 Menopur, and Ganirelex.  For my trigger shot, I had to take 2 Ovidrels.  For the fourth ovulation induction, I had the same protocol, except he also added clomid.  

For the one frozen embryo transfer, I was on estrace, medrol, progesterone in oil injections.  She used Follistim, Menopur, GanirelexWe had MF (low sperm count) and FF (PCOS). We came to Dr. Licciardi after having done a surgery for MF, monitored cycles and IUIs and having had one miscarrigae. We knew we wanted to move on to IVF. Dr. Licciardi recommended a basic IVF protocol  - gonal-f, PIO, ganirelix, doxycycline, ovidrel trigger - as our medical presentation made us good candidates for a basic cycle. Thankfully, he was right. We were able to transfer 1 fresh embryo, and froze 5 all of which were BB or above. We failed the fresh cycle - I believe my body was just too traumatized from all the meds of the cycle. We took a month break and came back for a FET, which was successful.Because I am an SMC, I had to do 6 natural IUIs before my insurance would kick in. After that I started with medicalized IUIs. I took Clomid from Day 4 to 8 twice but had serious side effect. I therefore refused to take it again and asked for another option. I am now taking Letrozol from day 4 to 8 and Ovridel to trigger the ovulation.We did 3 IUIs. Each time I took clomid and went in for monitoring. Trigger shot and then the next day came in for the IUI (done by a nurse). My husband gave a fresh sperm sample.While at first my protocol looked similar to the prior clinic we'd used for 3 rounds of eggs retrievals (all unsuccessful), I quickly saw that NYU was different. The nurses and Drs were constantly evaluating and tweaking my dosage. I took clomid pills, menapur injections, ganerilex injections and double trigger shots. For the transfer there was vaginal and oral estogren pills, as well as other injections. I produced 21 eggs for retrieval, 3 survived until day 5 and 2 tested normal w/ PGS. We transferred 1 embryo and I'm due to have a baby in less than 6 weeks.I came to Dr. Hodes-Wertz with PCOS. I was not ovulating and my parter had sub-optimal sperm.  I was put on a dosage of Letrozole.  The first dosage wasn't enough, but an increased dosage got me ovulating.  We were able to use a washed sample of my partner's sperm to do IUI.  The whole process was very quick and efficient - only 3.5 weeks from my first visit with Dr. Hodes until the IUI. The IUI was successful and I am now 7 weeks pregnant with twins!  I only wanted to use IUI as my insurance would not cover anything else- so she helped facilitate that and believed that there were quite a few options with in the IUI cycle that may work for me- so if Clomid wasn't working we could go down a different road in the IUI system. I felt this was really helpful and I really appreciated that she did not push IVF which I was opposed toFirst time was typically 300 Follistim and 150 Menapur.  For this current cycle, starting an estrogen patch a week before beginning injections to stabilize my estrogen levels and hopefully generate eggs that are more consistent (14 eggs retrieved last time, but many were too mature or too young).I cannot recall the medications I took, but I did do an endometrial scratch and we did do PGS. Diagnosis: diminished ovarian reserve plus both tubes removed
1st cycle: Agonist (300 Gonal F, 150 Menopur + Cetrotide) - 7 eggs retrieved, 2 mature, 0 fertilized
2nd cycle: Agonist (300 Gonal F, 300 Menopur+ Clomid + Cetrotide) + ICSI - 5 eggs retrieved, 4 mature, 3 fertilized, 2 transferred on day 5 - resulted in singleton pregnancyI don't remember specific medications or dosages. We stared the regular way (I believe I had a gonal F pen), but I reacted strongly to the meds and needed to be seen daily for monitoring and given the antagonist drugs fairly soon in my cycle (I believe it was Ganirelix). At my initial visit he did an internal ultrasound and took blood to determine egg quantity and quality. He then had me do the X-ray of my uterus which showed scar tissue.  I then had a Hysteroscopy to have it removed. I am now starting clomid and IUI I had one cycle and folistom was the primary medicine used.  My trigger shot was changed at the end to Lupron to avoid overstimulation. I decided to do IVF w dr liccardi after trying clomid pills for many months with my Obgyn. Dr liccardi felt strongly that an IUI or IVF cycle would work very well for me. We went with IVF (insurance covered one round) my treatment  included the HCG trigger shot. (Looking back- This should not have been part of my treatment) treatment was fine. I was a ""chicken with 18 eggs"" as one of the doctors told me. Retreval was a breeze. When it came to transfer I told the current doctor I was feeling incredibly bloated, uncomfortable etc... he told me since I had no weight gain it was normal since 18 eggs were remove. I proceeded with the transfer. Shortly after (a day or two)I found myself short of breathe and when I lied down it felt as if I was drowning..... turns out I was pregnant but I also had OHSS. I was hospitalized for a few nights. I had a lung tap, multiple stomach drains in dr liccardi office, another ER visit w another. Lung tap and yet another stomach drain. I gained a ton of weight due to fluids. Somehow I was able to maintain the pregnancy and today I have a healthy boy
I really can't remember the details of the protocols, but having come from another ""specialist"" in fertility medicine, his protocol was radically more aggressive and did involve more of a hormone therapy approach that was sure to bring results.  He stayed on top of our case and was always available within the day to get back to us with any questions we had for him.  The end result was after one unsuccessful implantation (second in total of trying to conceive) we now have a beautiful child who keeps us on our toes (thank G-d).Gonadotropin antagonist protocol using Gonal F, Menopour and Ganirelix with a Lupron trigger mixed with A small amount of HCG.   22 eggs retrieved, 16 embryos created, 11 at day 6. 3 PGS normal. One transfered. Positive. 3 different IVF protocols with some additional adjustments to see if we could make my eggs work -- there was one we didn't try but by that time I was over it and wanted to move on to donor eggs.Day 2 starter - Follistim (start w 300 units) / menopur (start w 150 units) with daily blood tests and ultrasound
HCG ovulation trigger

The first cycle with Dr. Grifo was a success.Dr. Berkeley put me on Clomid after doing comprehensive bloodwork (which included genetic testing).  I then triggered with Ovidrel and had an IUI.  At 6 weeks, I was diagnosed with a missed miscarriage and had a D&C with embryo testing at the clinic.This was several years ago so I don't remember fully. Dr Berkley wanted to use an aggressive approach since I had a failed cycle  which did not produce many eggs though I have a high egg reserve with a different dr. I was on menupur and Folistim I over stimulated so they had to do an HCG trigger. I produced 28 eggs. He told me he was going to be aggressive since I had a failed cycle previously so I knew what to expect. What I didn't know was that because of that the embryos had to be frozen and I could not do a fresh transfer. Honestly, I was SO focused on this, but since it was 2 years ago, I'd prefer not to. I really don't recall. I do think I was overstimulated given my age. I really truly don't think I needed all the drugs they gave me. They were very surprised that I produced so many eggs mid-way through and reduced my dosage of stims. I could barely walk my ovaries were so full! Seriously. It was brutal as was the recovery.It's been quiet a while and don't remember a lot of details.  He recommended IUI cycles with HG injections to time the injections.  With IVF he went high on the hormones, which I think was right given my age.  He also said with IVF that they won't do retrievals unless there are at least three follicles.  I only had two so he recommended I stop the medications and just to HG injection with IUI.  With the donor egg cycle, we synchronized our cycles with birth control pills and then went to estrogen pills and progesterone shots daily.  I don't know the rest of the protocols for the egg donor.  First my issue was not getting pregnant, it was having a healthy baby. I have a chromosome translocation which leads to miscarriage or fetus death.   It was a hard pill to swallow when I had to turn to using donor eggs. He never made me feel like I was alone.  Once I chose a donor from a private agency they did ALL the work for me. I just showed up for blood testing during cycle.  I cant remember what injectable I used to sync our cycles. But Week prior to transfer I injected progesterone oil I think so embryo will have better chance to stick. Day of transfer went so smoothly and contined the oil injections a few more days.  This IVF resulted in a positive pregancy.  I have a gorgeous baby girl who is now 2 1/2 years old.   We are choosing not to tell our child and family about using donor egg.  I have a 9 year old daughter using my own eggs.  Clomid and IUI for several years of unexplained infertility prior to seeing him. He prepared me well that it would likely not work and we would need to move to injections but surprise, it worked!I do not remember the entire regiment of medicine I took but I did take the  follicle stimulating hormone Gonal F my first round and then switched to a different stimulating medicine the second round in an effort to produce more eggs; although, I produced about the same amount.  I was also on Femara to protect me as I had hormone related breast cancer.See above.  I don't remember any of the names of the drugs.I have only completed one IUI cycle so far (unsuccessful). I used Clomid 5 mg on days 5-9. Then Ovidrel injection when I had a big enough follicle. On the second cycle my labs showed that I ovulated that day so they did not do IUI and recommended intercourse. I have not yet started my protocol (we are waiting on my husband to have another surgery in a few months) but I will be going through a cycle of IVF to do egg retrieval and freezing, then when the other doctor does my husband's surgery, if they find sperm (fingers crossed!) then they'll thaw and fertilize my eggs. 1- Gonal F with Ovidrel for 1st IUI cycle.  Gonal F was chosen over clomid bc my body had previously grown cysts with Clomid. Chemical Pregnancy. Ended having to take another Ovidrel 3 weeks post IUI to help remove cyst.

2 - Gonal F. I ended up ovulating before actually taking the Ovidrel. IUI was canceled.

3 - Switched to Menopur for follicle growth and began using cetrotide to delay ovulation.Ovidrel. No success with IUI.

4 - Menopur and will start cetrotride soon. 
I had a cycle of timed intercourse during which I took Ovidrel as trigger shot and then took Progesterone for two weeks after, but not successful.I was on 9 cycles of Letrozole with no changes in treatment over the course of that time.  In addition, I had one surgery to remove a polyp that she thought might improve my chances.We did 3 rounds of IUI with clomid that were unsuccessful.  Then we moved on the IVF with Follistim, Cetrotide, Menapur, and Ovudrel. With our AMH and stats, we were expected to produce 0-1 embryos per cycle. We got 5, and 3 were normal post PGS. So we only had to do one round. Menopur + Gonal F, trigger was Ovridel and LupronAfter three failed IUIs we moved onto IVF with PGS- was pregnant after first attempt. I was prescribed the usual IVF protocols and each cycle produced eggs and embryos, but for some reason there was a failure to implant. Pretty standard protocol for the 1st cycle.  Increased hormone stimulation before the 2nd one.High doses of stims- it worked because I got 30 eggs (which is May more than my previous 5 retrievals).My first cycle he utilized clomid and other meds in order to help with the stimulation. When that cycle failed (it was my second) he suggested donor eggs. The donor egg cycle worked. I used clomid to stimulate egg production, estrogen and progesterone shots for my IVF cycles. They all produced a good amount of eggs and we transferred 4 under her care. not everything goes as planned.  i needed to adjust the hormones and trust that Dr Goldman was tweaking  the medications in order to get better results each time.  i had to take a month off between the 2nd and 3rd retrieval.The first IVF was antagonist protocol good for older women. She used minimum amount of medications. The second IVF was also antagonist with increased medications to increase the amount of eggs. However, I had the same results. The third IVF was microdose lupron and had increased amount of eggs and embryos. I chose to do PGS, but sadly, all embryos were abnormal.Dr. Grifo followed a medium aggressive drug plan for me.  I do not recall the exact protocol, but I did not respond as expected and only ended up having one ovary really respond and 3 eggs retrieved.  Luckily, we had one healthy blastocyst that resulted in a healthy pregnancy. 300 follistim, 300 menopur, 5 days clomid, ganirelexBoth pregnancies -- Clomid (lowest dose) one cycle with monitoring (ultrasound).  IUI at the right time and I got pregnant.  Very lucky, I know.We are doing IVF with PGS and hopefully having more than one healthy embryo so we can freeze for later use. MenopurMenopur
FollistimI'm getting ""cycle-ready"" so I am in the beginning stages, I am due to have my uterus filled with saline to test it this week.We used IUI and Planned on doing that for 3 rounds. IF unsuccessful we would switch to IVF. 

Dr Fino was very accommodating. After the first unsuccessful IUI she allowed us to take the IVF classes and prepare for IVF while continuing the IUI treatment. We were luckily successful with the second IUIWe did IUI with clomid, never did progesterone. treatment strategy worked. he knows what he's doingI don't remember much. I remember estrogen patch with menopur and gonal f and ganerelixChlomid, IUI and Letrazolsorry I do not remember anymore.Follistem, Menipour, clomid, trigger shotWe did one round of IUI with letrozole and a trigger shot, and then the next round of IUI with Clomid and a trigger shot, which resulted in a pregnancy. To my knowledge at NYU, they will not transfer multiple embryos. In my case, we never got that far. They won't transfer multiple - against policy.She advocated for single embryo transferOur clinic does not do multiple embryo transfers and they explained the risks very clearly. My husband and I are on board. NYU as a practice prefers eSET vs. multiple embryo.  I asked Dr. Hodes on her opinion and she was very honest and explained the rationale behind it which is ultimately for the patient to give birth to a healthy baby. With multiple embryo transfer the pregnancy is at higher risk and does not increase the chances of a live birth.  I know that the clinic would consider multiple embryo transfers depending on the patients prognosis and history but they treat that case by case.  Dr. Hodes also went through IVF and had twins and she shared that information with me explaining how much harder her pregnancy and postpartum was with the twins vs. singleton.  I really appreciate her honesty and sharing her own personal experience .  Going through fertility could be lonely and having a doctor that understands not only the medical part but emotional is very helpful and beneficial to fertility treatment.Dr. Maxwell recommends single embryo transfer.Dr Keefe believes in single embryo transfer if at all possible, but is open to discussing multiple embryo transfer if the patient truly wishes to follow that course after having a thorough discussion.He goes for single embryo transfer initially. I didn't feel that there was a definitive approach being recommended and I got some confusing advice when it came time for my embryo transfer. I also didn't feel that it was discussed fully and properly in advance.Dr. Grifo is a strong supporter of PGS and single embryo transferN/aDr. grifo strongly urges for a single embryo transfer He felt very comfortable going with one each time. I wasn't interested in the risk of multiples given my ""Advanced"" age. My frozen embryos were PGD & PGS tested. NYU informed me that they only do eSET for my circumstance. That is what I wanted as well.He prefers to only transfer one PGS tested embryo. He says there are too many risks to the mother and baby with Multiples. I don't know if he would agree to transfer multiple. I did not press him on this because his argument makes a lot of sense. Dr. Hodes suggested we do pgs testing due to high FSH (when first tested 16 but then dropped) she said it was the best option for us since we were running out of time. Since all embryos will be PGS tested, NYU supports single embryo transfer. NYU uses the eSET approach unless the multiple embryo transfer is discussed first, and I believe this is used on a case by case basis.  I am comfortable with the fact that Dr. Berkeley uses eSET as I am in my 40's and already at high risk if and when I conceive.  She is pushy for just implanting 1 embryo at a time.  She herself has twins (from doing IVF) so I can only assume it's because she wants the potential for more money.  However I was told I would have final say and could implant a max of 2 embryos.  I was not there yet. But I think she would transfer one or two embryos. She didn't want me to have multiple babies.Dr. Hodes-Wertz's approach to recommend both PGS and single embryo transfer made me feel safe and confident in my pregnancy. I did not do embryo transfers but in my initial consult Dr. Grifo strongly disagrees with transferring more than one embryo. We had 2 PGS tested embryos at the end of the retrieval and asked Dr Grifo his thoughts on transferring both. He strongly preferred transferring one, saying odds for pregnancy wouldn't increase w/ 2 and given my age (39) why risk both taking and having an even higher risk pregnancy. His rationale was, would you be more upset to not have a 3rd child or lose both and not get the 2nd you've been trying for all this time.No experience with Dr. Berkeley on thisSince I used a younger donor and told him I couldn't handle having twins, he was very supportive of doing just a single embryo transfer.  It worked out great for me.Dr. Grifo is not a proponent of multiple embryo transfer because he feels it puts the mother at risk unnecessarily. NYU recommends eSETI highly respect the fact that more than one embryo implantation is NOT recommended by the clinic. They put the patient and baby's health ahead of the numbers game. Strongly emphasizes transferring one embryo and warns against risk of multiples. i didnt want multiples and Dr Goldman felt that transferring one embryo was more safe than transferring 2In my case he was adamant about only one embryo to minimize risk. I am very happy that they placed 3 embryos at a time.  I strongly believe this is the most appropriate option for  women who are in their late 30's or older.Dr. Grifo does not endorse multiple embryo transfer but is willing to do so at the patient's request or insistence. Dr. Grifo shared his concerns about transferring one PGS normal embryo at a time. Given our embryos were normal, he was pretty adamant about his thoughts on transferring one at a time to reduce risks. However, he ultimately said that he'd do whatever we wanted. NYU prefers and indeed recommends single embryo transfer, especially if you opt for PGS, due to the risks associated with a multiples pregnancy.Not discussed with Grifo yet, but my philosophy is to take as little drugs as possible, especially after the recent bombarding I did to my body, and the fact that I have no issues ovulating and a well functioning endometrium. Her policy I assume is that of NYU's, which is single only - they wont do multiples. Higher risk of multiple pregnancies compromising heath and development of each other. I'd be a single mom if this works...so twins was not something I was eager to get out of this anyway. NYU recommends single embryo transfer for PGS tested embryos.  We discussed all of the risks.She definitely pushed for eSET as we did a frozen transfer and the embryo was already tested and viable.  It got us out of the 40-50% viability with a fresh transfer.  Also we were very clear we did not want twins.For me, he definitely was set on single embryo transfer and would not even discuss allowing me to have more than one embryo transferred. He would not budge.I was strongly advised by Dr. Berkeley, given my age, to do PGS and aim for a single embryo transfer.  From what I understand, Dr. Licciardi feels strongly that it is safer to transfer one embryo, and rarely recommends transferring multiple. We discussed this at length with him prior to our FET, and ultimately trusted his judgment and transferred one. Strongly encouraged to do single.The NYU practice strongly recommends a single transfer, especially with PGS embryos. You would have to override their recommendation to transfer multiple embryos.I think my doctor's approach was dead on.  She recommended PGS and after the results, she recommended a single embryo transfer.  Given the problems, I have seen with twins,  particularly with older women-I would highly recommend this approach.  Dr Berkeley promotes single embryo transfer. However when we transferred the first embryo it didn't take. Since we did not do PGD testing He recommended that we transfer 2 embryos the next time. It became a successful single birth. The next transfer he recommends we transfer 2 again  he said statistically non PGD tested embryos will have a 50% success rate. So the statistics are in your favor when transferring 2. Knowing that I asked him why we didn't transferred 2 the first time as well. we only made 5 embryos so there would always be 1 odd one out and he didn't advise to transfer 3. The first one transferred was the best quality embryo so statistically it had a highest chance of success as it was. Haven't done that yet. But we'll only do 1. prefer eSETDr. Goldman and our clinic's policy was to transfer one single embryo. She prefers eSET but I never reached transfer so it was never discussed in detail.I very much agreed with Dr. Grifo's approach of only implanting one embryo and doing genetic testing.  He stressed the importance of having a healthy pregnancy - considering the risks to the mother, instead of just focusing on getting pregnant and risking multiples.He said he would only do single transfers for my age groupHe did not provide an feedback on that.  I only had 2 good embryos so we went with both of them.",8.0,8.199999999999994,"Unexplained fertility on our part, so we tried 4 IUI's (1 natural, 3 with clomid) which all failed. Honestly can't remember the specifics...I used gonadal F, menopur and ovidrel for the egg retrieval and freezing. He used Letrizole to try something different because I had 3 failed clomid IUI. For the FET I also didn't know why we were using estradiol when estrogen always normal and I ovulate on my own. For this current cycle, starting an estrogen patch a week before beginning injections to stabilize my estrogen levels and hopefully generate eggs that are more consistent (14 eggs retrieved last time, but many were too mature or too young).I cannot recall the medications I took, but I did do an endometrial scratch and we did do PGS. 3 different IVF protocols with some additional adjustments to see if we could make my eggs work -- there was one we didn't try but by that time I was over it and wanted to move on to donor eggs. But I think she would transfer one or two embryos. NYU recommends eSETI highly respect the fact that more than one embryo implantation is NOT recommended by the clinic."
19,NYU Langone Fertility Center,cost,"Around $500 for ovulation induction.

I'm still getting bills a year later . .. . all in probably $40k with medicines10k for Each egg retrieval and close to 2k for meds each roundMy insurance covered the IVF process so the costs were minimal. If your company is willing, definitely speak to them about adding ART coverage to the health insurance plan.

I think one round of IVF would have been upwards of $25k9,200$14,500 for ER/Fresh Transfer ICSI + monitoring 
$1500 for embryo freezing 
$3600 + fees for PGS testing 
$2-8K for meds My workup was paid for by insurance. My IUI was supposed to be covered by insurance but the insurance said my numbers were low, and they refused to cover IUI without drugs, so I paid for it myself rather than use drugs I didn't think I needed. I got pregnant on the first try. :)IVF was not insurance-covered so was about $12,500 + medicines and genetic testing (total $20-25k)Insurance covered it 12,500 for treatment. 9,000 for drugs and pgs testing was 3,600It was covered under my insurance. I only had to pay for PGS testing. Once I was pregnant I had to pay for the sonograms. Fully covered by insurance except for $25 co-pays each visit (thank goodness!)My insurance covered IUI and I had to pay copays for ultrasound and insemination itself, $50 each. So in total I paid $300 for 3 cycles of IUI. IVF should also be covered, however genetic screening is not covered and will cost me over $4000 (up to 10 embryos, I may get reimbursement if less than 10), plus $300 for each embryo tested in a lab. I also decided to freeze good embryos, for future use, so this will be additional $7000 or more. I won't be surprised if any other charges will come up. All IUI costs were covered by insuranceIUI and IVF were covered by insurance, meds were out of pocket (~$5000), biopsy for PGS was ~$4,600 out of pocket.$4500/IVFMy insurance provided 20K in fertility benefits that is all going towards my IVF cycle at NYU. PGD & PGS testing from Natera costs 6K. I have paid around 3K to NYU so far. I had a copay for many of the medications so I ended up paying $350 for the medications needed during my gonadotropin protocol. I opted to do a natural cycle for my FET and was prescribed Crinone (Progesterone gel). The cost of those with insurance was $90 for a box of 15. I had to buy 4 boxes for a total of $360.$6900 for egg freezing and storage for one year. 1,000 for anesthesia. I received a discount because it was medically necessary for me. $20K+My insurance covered my appointments until I received an official diagnosis of infertility. Blood work and ultrasound visits (which happen roughly 2 times a week) are $500 and out IUI was close to $4,500 including medications, monitoring, and the actual procedure Covered by insurance.
Out of pocket $3,600 PGS testing My doctorDoes not take my insurance so the initial consultation was $500 and the cost of each IUI  is around $1000-$1500 and the cost of IVF is $17,000 plus outside lab genetic testing fees around $3000 plus the medication is From $2000 -$8000.labs are about $150 each, IUI about $600, u/s $250, specimen handling fee $75, I believe.The costs are astronomical no matter where you end up going.  This is the reality of infertility treatment in the US.  Co pay only at this time.  Insurance covered everything else.  It's NYU. I think it was expensive. But most of insurance will cover.  Website of NYU says The self-pay fee for an initial consultation with physician is approximately $500. The cost of an IVF cycle using fresh eggs, without genetic testing, starts at $12,650. My IUI was covered by insurance; however, I had to pay for the Ovardril approximately $75 and ultra sounds were applied to my deductible which was about a total of $198Around $500 for a natural cycle IUI and I think around $1200 for an IUI with monitoring and medicationMy insurance did not cover IUI so I think we paid between 1-2K per cycleDr Grifo did not accept my primary insurance (Cigna) but did take my secondary (UHC). Many things were covered, but this was our fourth egg retrieval in 1 calendar year so we didn't have a lot of coverage left. Out of pocket was ICSI and PGS, and they charged you in advance and refunded the difference (if fewer embryos made/tested).Dr. Hodes-Wertz accepted my insurance so I had minimal out of pocket costs.  Most of my co-pays were for bloodwork and tests.$1kInsurance covered almost everything for me (most of medication cost plus $25K lifetime max for treatment). I think a single IVF cycle runs about $12,500 (plus additional costs - e.g., ICSI, biopsy for PGS).IUI is covered by my insurance and so far I have only had deductible charges.  They are high, but that is because of my insurance. But they are very upfront about costs before any tests or procedures Somewhere in the range of $15,000 for IVF with ICSA.  and Around $5000 for transferring of eggs after.10 - 15kMy IUI protocol and treatment were covered under insurance.  I had copays.I don't remember much.  I think the first IVF cycle was maybe $10k or $12k before insurance.  The frozen embryo cycle was less than $5k.  Frozen embryo cost $1,200 plus another $1k annually for storage.  IUI was much cheaperIncluding using private donor.  This cucle cost us around $30,000My insurance covered a portion (up to $5k per year I think). I covered the rest.Don't recall the details.  It was a lot, and most was not covered by insurance.I haven't gotten there yet... $35 copays and $100 per IUI. Medications averages around $195 per cycle. minimal co-paysIUI cycles top to bottom are about $1500-2000 per month depending on the monitoring costs.  As I move onto frozen transfer IVF, it is estimated it would cost about $18k top to bottom.IUI and IVF were covered by insurance. PGS was not- we paid around $8,000 based on embryo count. Between $15-20 for retreival and $2k for transfer all in i spent around $85,000 -$90,000 including medication and acupunctureEgg freeze - $12000
Ivf- $7000 OOPSince insurance covered the majority, all I had to pay out of pocket was 1kI'm sorry - it was a long time ago.  I remember they didn't take my insurance so I had to submit by hand, but they always had the paperwork ready for me.  It wasn't cheap, but we weren't expecting it to be.$15000Under $500 for consultation and basic diagnostics test. Approximately $15k per cycleI have insurance so I just pay a small co-pay60KInsurance didn't cover any of my treatment so it was about $15,000 each time including ivf icsi and medstotal over the yrs probably over $150KMy insurance almost completely covered my treatment. There were a few bills for ultrasounds and IUI, but overall less than $200 I would guess.For a self-pay full cycle, with PGS testing, transfer and medications the OVERALL cost (everything included) is approximately $24,000. I  fortunately had good insurance which covered most of the costs of our first cycle with frozen embryo transfer. We did however, have to pay out of pocket for the PGS testing, about $7000, and then we had to pay out of pocket for the second transfer as it put us over my lifetime max. That was $4000. Medications out of pocket were about 7K, insurance covered IVF I beleive the cost was about 8K, PGS testing was $5,100 upfront for related costs but receive refund for embryos not able to be testedOn par with other NYC facilities but to be honest, I can't remember exactly. Depends. If insurance covers, the value per IVF cycle charged is lower (about $7,500), if you are paying OOP the iVF cycle is about $10,200. Retrieval anesthesia, cryo, transfer, PGS costs, drugs are all separate. I don't have all the info yet because of insurance processing delays, but if you are doing all OOP, costs are as follow (approx. total $: 24,000)

- $15,300 retrieval + cryo + PGS
- $1,000 retrieval anesthesia 
- $2,500 PGS lab testing (minimum fee, pending # of biopsied embryos)
- $5,000 drugs

Insurance scam I leaned about after many hours on the phone amidst my full time job: my Express Scripts insurance drug coverage gives me a lifetime max coverage of $4,000. If I process through insurance 1 pen of Gonal F 900 units, the cost is of $1,900. If I pay OOP, the cost is of $850 through the same pharmacy. So.... with my insurance I was hoping to cover at least 80% of the drugs I needed for 1 cylce, and with 2 pens of Gonal F (approx. 10% of the drugs I actually needed) my life time max was done! 

Appalling... specially when you read Australian blogs in which women go through 10 cycles of IVF for free...it is the same as far as i know for all the docs at nyu... nyu cycle is 11,700 because I'm doing PGS (PGS is another 2-3,000 i think it is ...plus the outside lab fees)...there are other fees too. If I make it to transfer that will be 2,000 i thinkOur first cycle was completely covered by United Healthcare with the exception of PGS testing.  The first cycle totaled approximately $21,000.  Our second cycle (retrieval, PGS testing and transfer) have been completely covered by Progeny.We are fortunately covered for 3 cycles of IVF through insurance (but not PGS testing). From what it looks like, their costs are comparable to NYC average.About $20,000 -25,000 per retrieval all in (including meds) and $5,000 for the transfer.  This is probably too simplistic as it was a very complicated process.First round, years ago, all out of pocket and nearly $20,000 for an egg retrieval and embryo creation (for freezing). Then the clinic went in network and my 2 FET's were covered by insurance but I reached my lifetime maximum fertility benefit with the 2 FET cycles and everything is out of pocket. I haven't gotten the bill for the IUI but looks as if it will cost a couple thousand because of all the morning monitoring. (I never get the home ovulation test kits to work right for me so I chose to have monitoring done at the clinic and I required a lot during the cycle post-miscarriage.)Each IvF cycle for Phase 1 - that includes ovulation induction, morning monitoring, egg retrieval (not including Anesthesia), biopsy of up to 6 embryos (for PGS purposes), cryopreservation of embryos and transportation costs to reprogenetics lab was $15,150, out of pocket.  The Phase 2 - which is the frozen embryo transfer as part of this IvF cycle was $2000 out of pocket.   After our second IvF cycle, NYU began to accept our insurance, which helped with bringing down our costs.  However, our insurance did not cover biopsy, shipping/handling of samples.  Reprogenetics, the lab that performs the PGS tests,  had their own fees, which were all out of pocket.  We were charged $1000 base fee, plus $250 per embryo.    10k for the procedure/labs/sonograms (all those included under the number), about 10k for all the meds(depending on how your body responds to her treatment plan with meds can make cheaper or  more expensive), 1200-1400 for anesthesiologist for egg retrieval12,600 for IVF cycle + 3000 for ICSI + 1000(?) for embryo storage$15.5k for cycle with PGS, $3k for meds and $5k for PGSA round of IVF was $18,500. Since we had a lot of embryos and did PGS testing and an FET, that added on about $10k more in cost.My exams before the egg freezing cycle and before I decided to get pregnant were covered as were my visits after I became pregnant. My medications for the freezing cycle and for pregnancy were covered.  The rest was not.  For one 
IFV cycle, one icsi and one implementation cost me about $22,000.  In addition, I paid another $3,000 for PGS testing.  With in-network insurance, IVF plus frozen transfer was around 10 and PGS was about 2-3k additional.  (Not including the PGS lab)I can't remember the exact price of the cycles but they are pretty upfront about the costs.For a full IVF cycle with ICSI and initial freezing it was approximately $15,000. That was 3 years ago.15K?I received financial assistance from Live Strong so each cycle was discounted.  My cost per cycle was $6750.I have excellent insurance so all we paid for was the PGS testing and the cost to biopsy in addition to th cryo fees to freeze the blastocystsI have UHC/Progyny insurance and it's amazing.  $8K per cycle $25-30k for an IVF cycle$17,000 from start to finish including ICSI + meds.

21,RMA of New York,doctor,"Dr. Copperman was a phenomenal communicator. He was compassionate, caring and genuine. He was very thorough and always spent as much time as necessary with me to ensure all my questions were answered and all of my concerns were addressed. I told him that I had white coat syndrome and he never wore his white coat when meeting with me from that point forward. He would email me directly to check in on me throughout my cycle. Dr. Copperman was the best part of my visit to RMA NY every time I got to see him. He is so sweet and sincere. His bedside manner was out of this world. He encouraged me throughout my cycle and praised me for my bravery in my decision to preserve my fertility. There is literally no other Reproductive Endocrinologist that I would trust with my fertility other than Dr. Copperman. The choice was easy. He was so sweet to my partner and great with my sister. On the day of the surgery he was kind and calm. I walked into the OR room which could have been a scary intimidating experience but he reassured me and walked me in. The team introduced themselves to me and explained what role they would be playing in my retrieval. He held my hand as they put me under anesthesia. I adore him and am so grateful for him. Dr. Stein is an amazing doctor and I would highly recommend him to anyone looking for answers to their fertility problems. The first time I visited him, he evaluated me and told me that my issue was very simple and that I shouldn't do a treatment that was too invasive. I appreciated this feedback because I've heard of stories where the doctors go straight for IVF even though simpler treatments would work just as well. Dr. Stein prescribed me Letrozole for 5 days and a trigger shot midway through my cycle, and in two months I was pregnant! I appreciate his professional recommendation and his honesty when it came to the right treatment for me.  
The nurses and staff were also very nice and I never had to wait too long during monitoring hours. He can certainly be very candid - I have a uterine factor issues which precludes me from carrying a child, and he was quite blase to say ""you are super healthy, except for the bad uterus!"". This really didn't hurt my feelings - I've known about my condition for a long time, but if a patient were more sensitive, I suppose this could be a weakness of his. His pros outweigh the ""con"" in my mind - he's thorough, aggressive in treatment, and does listen to questions and walk you through next steps. My first cycle was fine - I ended up getting 12 eggs, 7 mature, 6 fertilized. Of those 6, 3 made it to blast and all 3 were ""chromosomally"" normal. That's a great yield, but for this next round, we're taking a different approach to try and get more mature eggs and hopefully have more embryos to work with.I had success with our first transfer which I hadn’t expected. I was 41 when I gave birth. He definitely helped us get to where we wanted to be very quickly.  I had a bad experience with the clinic and he was very responsive and made me feel heard and supported. Dr. Lekovich is straight forward but kind. She does not talk down to you and will explain everything going on. For all the major procedures (retrievals, transfers) she was the one doing it. Monitoring and IUI was done by rotating doctors. Dr. Lekovich explains everything that is going to happen in detail.  She is not a fan of medicating if it not necessary.  All of my IUIs were done just with Ovidrel.  She would have allowed me to take more meds if i really wanted to but she didn't feel it was necessary.  I appreciate that she doesn't just fill up every patient with hormones without considering side-effects and the change for multiples.  She is very direct  and clear.  She does not coddle or spend a lot of time on letting her patients feel bad and disappointed.  She just moves on to the next step in the plan, which i appreciate but may bot be for everyone.  for my actual IUIs, she only performed one and other doctors did the other two.  I would have preferred that she be able to do all of them, but the other doctors were equally qualified and kind.On our consultation, Dr. Flisser really took his time explaining to us how the ivf process works and what protocols he may suggest for us. He answered all of our concerns and we didn’t feel rushed at all especially we had our appointment at the end of the day. During the course of the treatment, we had to change the course of tx to iui because I didnt have enough eggs for the retrieval. He was kind enough to call us while he was on vacation to explain to us why we must take this route. He was very kind and understanding. I feel very well taken care of. Dr. Stein did seem open and willing to go over the procedure.  But he voiced his opinion early on about what he thought we should do.  And being the doctor, the expert, that is probably a good thing.  But it felt a bit like he was making the decision for us on what treatment we should do.  I believe he did this because he truly felt that this was the best course of action for us and would give us the ""best results.""  He is available at most visits and was very involved in my treatment. Dr. Lekovich is always honest and clear in her approach, along with reasoning for why she implements specific treatment planning.  She is available through email, is quick to respond, and always always makes us feel at ease after each communication.If I could take Dr. Klein with me everywhere I go, I would.  He is equally kind, compassionate, and knowledgeable. He explains things clearly and takes the time to answer any questions I had, sets clear expectations and fully appraises you of the risks.  Dr McAvy helped us thru our journey to have our family both times. She answered any question we had and was upfront and honest throughout the process.  I was very happy with her bed side manner. We felt at ease being in her care. Dr Klein was sympathetic, caring, took his time explaining things, positive and optimistic about the entire process. I never felt rushed or like I was another number on his schedule. He made me feel confident in the process and was just very sweet overall. I trusted him with the process as well. He showed compassion when I had a miscarriage (without doing IVF as it just happened naturally without doing an IVF cycle). I always felt excited to see him because he was always positive and showed encouragement that everything will be fine and work out. He was never negative or quiet. He explained everything in detail and answered all my questions promptly and accurately. He is very knowledgeable and offered great recommendations towards which route to take to conceive. My husband I are so grateful for Dr. Sekhon. After being diagnosed with PCOS, we knew we needed help getting pregnant and Dr. Sekhon came highly recommended. In our first meeting, she took the time to clearly outline the entire process and all of our options while answering every single hypothetical question we had. We started off doing two IUIs, which were both negative, and then moved on to IVF. Dr. Sekhon closely monitored my protocol as PCOS can put me at high risk for OHSS, but everything was smooth. She was caring and thoughtful during our appointments and in every email exchange and phone call we had. After one failed transfer, we ended up doing a second retrieval and a second transfer, and I'm now 10 weeks pregnant. While it was a long eight months and one of the most challenging points in my life, I would do it all over again in a minute and much of that is attributed to Dr. Sekhon. On our first visit with Dr Lederman he fully explained all the testing we were going to do due to our circumstances. We sort of knew what our prognosis was before going to the fertility clinic but he explained it in more detail and what further testing should be done. He was very patient with me and the multitude of questions i had. Because of a hearing disability I have I had the doctor repeat himself multiple times and to speak slowly when asked so i can write his answers down on a notebook. After the initial consultation we saw him during the egg retrieval process and he conducted both the egg retrieval and transfer. Dr. Sandler is an expert in this field, but lacks the human touch that people who must rely to IVF want to see in a doctor. He did not respect my feelings nor my time as a patient. The first round of IVF was very much of a trial with a limited number of eggs retrieved and transferred before reaching the blastocyst stage. As I agreed to do PGS for the second round, I received much more attention and information by dr. Sandler although he was never so positive it would work (while it did).Dr. Stein is straightforward, honest, and gives you data based information. I did 3 IUI’s by choice (he told me there was a low percent chance they would work for me, but IVF felt too extreme for me to start with) that were unsuccessful. I then moved to IVF. My first retrieval yielded two embryos and due to wanting two children, he suggested doing one more (he wants two viable embryos for each child you want). My second retrieval he completely changed the medical protocol and I ended up with 8 embryos! My first implant took, and I’m currently pregnancy and expecting in 2020. Dr. Stein is personable and you really feel like he wants you to be successful. I will definitely be back with him when I’m ready for baby 2. Dr. Flisser is an amazing doctor!! One of the best I have ever been to!! I feel very grateful that he was assigned to me! He is extremely intelligent and up to date on current fertility research and practices. He took the time to thoroughly answer all my questions and you can tell he cares about his patients and has a warm bedside manner, but also he will be very honest and gives you scientific answers which I appreciated. I was also happy with the amount of eggs retrieved. He is truly the best of the best and I highly recommend him!Dr. Thornton lacks both compassion and apparent scholarship. When I asked her about some of the emerging trends in medical journals regarding new treatment approaches for women my age she was not aware of them.  I do not believe she fully evaluated my prior protocols to appropriately consider making modifications as she insisted on continuing with a treatment protocol that had failed twice. She did not listen to my needs or concerns as a patient and made me fel very devalued. She lacked a signifcant degree of compassion for my unique circumstances.Please see prior answer. He is very caring and knowledgeable. He has remained responsive through the whole treatment process and even after. Gives realistic expectations. Would definitely recommend himI only saw him to use eggs that had been previously frozen by RMA (with a different doctor that had left the practice).  He didn’t seem particularly thorough compared to other fertility doctors I have seen, nor did he seem compassionate Dr. Thornton is smart and thoughtful.  She did take the time to get to know me and my priorities.  That said, I don't think she shared enough medical information with me - why she was making the decisions she did and what various risks and side effects were along the way.

I started treatment when I was 32 - she basically told me I could or could not do PGS testing given my age.  4 transfers later with 2 miscarriages (1 ectopic) and 2 failed transfers I am frustrated that little was changed from cycle to cycle and we were encouraged to make other changes (such as PGS testing or supplemental changes).We sought out Dr. McAvey as a second opinion for our situation. We had been told at our previous clinic that IVF was our only option, which was so painful and stressful. After that failed, we brought all this info to her, and she really went through the paperwork, listened, and brought up her own concerns, such as cancer history of the family. She even agreed that IUI was an option for us. I'm currently still in treatment, but even if something wasn't progressing the way it should have Dr. McAvey immediately tried something different and it paid off. Even if this cycle doesn't result in a pregnancy, we plan on continuing to see her for future treatments. Dr. Lekovich has a very calm demeanor when explaining our treatments and outcomes.  We have appreciated this about her.  She has been thoughtful in her approach, and gentle when we have received not-so-great news.  She is proactive in making adjustments in treatments, and has taken the time to explain all steps and answer even the smallest of questions.  She uses research to back-up her rationale for each treatment approach, and thoughtfully explains each decision without hesitation.We really like Dr. Sekhon when we speak with her, but it's rare. Our issue is mainly with RMA and how its run and the human error that occurs with the nurses on an almost regular basis. Dr. Sekhon is very informative and when we speak with her, she is thorough in her responses (vs on email sometimes we have to ask multiple questions to gain full clarity).I truly cannot express how wonderful Dr. Flisser was. He made me feel so comfortable throughout the process. He always kept my husband and I in the loop, explaining what was happening, what he was doing, what the next steps were, and what we could expect. As a scientist myself, I was incredibly impressed by his ability to describe medical procedures and situations in terms that anyone could understand. He had such a calm, reassuring demeanor that I knew I didn’t have to worry about ANYTHING—all I had to do was take my medications as prescribed and show up when scheduled and Dr. Flisser and the RMA team would ensure that everything would work out.She sent me to different tests and has never explained or discussed the results. RMA does not provide a patient portal system and she does not share all the test results, not mention to review them or responds to them. It has been a very difficult experience. She is not thorough and will let things fall through the cracks. He is extremely data driven and clearly makes his decisions based on my specific case and takes great care in reviewing my charts at every turn. He's very precise in how he does this. I also felt like during the more difficult appointments he made a point to spend more time with me and answer all my questions and make sure I was feeling as good as possible about our plan of action. He also has called me in response to an email I sent him once just to make me feel better. He clearly cares about his patients and wants them to succeed at having a healthy pregnancy. Incredibly sensitive, thoughtful and reassuring. He has a calming demeanor and answered any question we had. He also did a good job delineating between what doctors knew versus what they suspected about reproduction which allowed us to have a more nuanced understanding of the process ahead.Dr. Thornton is great at following standard operating procedures, but doesn't provide a high quality of care.  She is incredibly risk averse.  I often felt I knew more about my course of treatment through internet research then what she was able to tell me.  She doesn't seem to care about her patients and doesn't always follow through on what she describes as ""next steps"" in course of treatment.  After 3 years, I feel like I can't trust her and have little confidence in what she says.At the end of the day, my IVF procedure worked and I am pregnant. I transitioned to Dr. Sekhon from a doctor who left the clinic and the transition was messy and often fraught with bad communication and lack of compassion. Since I have not seen another doctor is hard to compare. Dr. Sandler to another one. He is very busy yet always professional, he will explain procedures in technical details if you ask or care, and answer your questions in a satisfactory manner, he is very straight forward and not ""a warm"" person but that didn't bother me. What did bother me is that he only changed treatment once and it didn't work as well (not his fault) and the fact that he did not consider that other results maybe possible to attain due to my age. I am seeing another doctor for a second consult, but I do believe that Sandler and RMA do things by ""the book"", especially for AMA /DOR and don't like to take risks, or try new things. He is knowledgeable and will make decisions based on facts (ie blood tests to confirm if ovidrel shot is needed and such) but that is also a very cookie-cutter approach, one size fits all.  Not sure if the results would have differed if one of the variables were changed, since that didn't happen. 

I wish he was more open to trying new things or Ill ask if he has a reason for sticking to the method he thinks works best (which  is the medically expected program for DOR). My advice is to not be intimidated and ask as many questions along the way as you need.  Dr. Sandler seems to be very knowledgeable about his field and really cares about his patients.  But his communication skills are a bit lacking. He seems to run the appointments with a clear formula in mind, most prominently considering what he thinks you need rather than answer your questions or listening to what your concerns are.  We wouldn’t focus on the things that I wanted to talk about or I was concerned with but rather the things he thought we should be discussing.This was the 3rd clinic we came to and it really makes the biggest difference to feel in good hands and at a clinic you like. Dr Lederman was professional, friendly and able to answer all the questions we had during our first visit. We decided to proceed with the clinic for IVF and we did one egg retrieval that unfortunately didn't result in any viable embryos. Dr Lederman called me immediately when these results came through and was very compassionate in delivering this obviously disappointing news. We are discussing a next retrieval with Dr Lederman for which he has suggested increasing the medication dosages during stimulation to try for more mature eggs. We feel in very good hands with Dr Lederman and the whole team and would highly recommend him to anyone.Dr. McAvey is a fast talker. She is warm and friendly. If you come in with a list of questions (you can prepare in advance and email her), she will respond to almost all of them. She listens to your ideas about protocol changes and will work with you to try to find the best results.Dr. McAvey has been great to work with.  The only thing I wish was that she was the one doing the retrievals and available during all of my monitoring appointments instead of sometimes the nurse doing the ultrasounds instead.As mentioned earlier, Dr. Mukherjee offers a wonderful experience to his patients, as much as this is possible under circumstances. He works in concert with his nursing staff and I feel he tailors treatment to the specific and unique needs of every patient.Dr Sekhon is such a breath of fresh air compare to my last RE. She is kind, respectful, detailed in her responses and generally seems to care. She never makes you feel like you are a number. She really knows what she is talking about and is on top of all the latest studies and treatment options. She never just does something because that is just what is typically done. She really seems to tailor her conversations and treatments to the specific patient and really goes out of her way to make sure that she answers all your questions and makes you feel comfortable. She has also been through IVF herself so she actually knows what her patients are going through physically and mentally. I cannot recommend her more. Dr. Muhkerjee, when I did get a chance to meet with him has been very nice. When having phone consultations, things seem very rushed and he gave more directives than an opportunity to figure out what wasn't working.As other reviews have stated, Dr. Grunfeld speaks quickly. But if you have read up on medication for IVF, embryo stages, PGS testing, etc., it's easy to follow and not confusing. 
That said, I definitely think he doesn't go into all of the details and is talented at making you just trust the process. I wish more was discussed about the fertilization process of the actual egg, the growth of the embryo, the different embryo qualities and then what happens before PGS testing.Dr. Stein is relatively blunt, which i appreciate, but I never felt like he was analyzing me or putting together plans/recos specific to me while in the midst of my cycle. the fact that i saw him once, and that we never had ANY discussions throughout my cycle made me feel like a number.Dr. Grunfeld is kind but not overly warm. He gets straight to the point, which I appreciate. He's direct and no nonsense. I felt that he was closely watching my progression on the stimulation medications, and toward the end, he had me come in every day for monitoring and blood work to see if they could push me a little farther. it was reassuring to know that he was constantly reviewing my case, rather than applying a generic protocol
Dr. Klein was a wonderful physician. He listened to our concerns, and answered all our questions without being condescending or rushed. He gave us his email after our first appointment, and any time I emailed him with questions, he responded promptly. He was very kind and supportive of our decisions throughout our fertility journey.Dr. Stein has been doing this for a very long time and knows his stuff.  However his overconfidence was off putting to me.  He talked a big game about how great and successful IVF is however I felt he did not give me realistic expectations for my own situation.  I also felt that he has the same protocol for everyone and does not waiver from that. I felt that he has no bed side manner and bushed aside many of my concerns. He responds to emails within minutes, he’s aware of how we’re feeling and what’s important, and he’s very bright and knowledgeable. I trust him entirely with our care, and I believe our best interests are what’s most important to him. Dr. Lederman is a great doctor.  He's relatively warm and compassionate, but he's also realistic.  He always sets expectations.  I had (have) a difficult road, and even switched doctors at one point to see if there was another doctor who would do a better job.  I ended up coming back. 

He does need a lot of pushing and convincing to try tests/protocols outside of his standard method.  But there are some procedures he will not buy into, and he will share the evidence and explanation as to why (even if you don't agree).During the consultation she provided research information on the two options which she has provided us. She also referred us to a specialist for additional surgery/ second opinion and also provided us with research about treatment with out without the surgery. she was not pushy with the options and let us make the decision. She is a firm believer about having 1 embryo implanted and voiced her concerns about twins. she was also open about adjusting medication according to reactions and what not. she is very forward and will let you know if she agrees with some things or not. I like that she is up to date on research and current treatment options. I do like that she does not do duplication of testing if it came back normal/out dated. He was kind, compassionate, and patient. He made a big effort to listen to the details of my situation, my concerns, and my questions. I felt like he really wanted me to have success and get pregnant quickly and safely. I felt very comfortable speaking with him.Very knowledge and I felt 100% confident in his abilities. He is very fixed on his way which seems to work. He is not open to transferring mosaics as he not only wants you to conceive a baby but a healthy baby. He never performed any procedures which was a shame, he always promised me he'd do my transfer but wasn't available on the week it took place.Dr. Lederman is a wonderful, kind and understanding Dr. who focused solely on our infertility issues at hand and remained positive and provided encouragement when outcomes didn't go in our favor. He was always available for a phone call and always responded to my emails at all times of the day and on weekends. I always had a lot of questions and concerns and he was always there to calm me down and assure me that everything was ok. His communication skills and ability to make you feel like a person and not another infertility statistic is his top strengths as a doctor.

Through his positive support and perseverance we were able to achieve a favorable outcome and a successful transfer in October 2018. Our miracle baby Girl was born in July 2019 and we owe all our success to him!Dr. Lederman was clearly a very knowledgeable doctor.  He was very professional and demonstrated good bedside manner.  The reason I decided to change clinics was because I was still hopeful that I could be successful with pregnancy through IUI's and there seemed to be no other treatment plan then the same four IUI's he performed.  I took a small dose of letrozole, was monitored, used a trigger shot, then my IUI was performed.  He never recommended any type of surgery such as a laparoscopy, hysteroscopy or any other research to try and figure out how else to help my husband and I.  It seemed as if IVF was our only route.  At time time, IUI's were covered by my insurance 100% so I really wanted to try injectables with IUI and he explained that there was not enough research to support that it helped increase our chances.  As much as I wanted to trust him and continue seeing him, the distance from my house to the office was a factor as well as Dr. Lederman not in agreement to try a different treatment plan before IVF. Dr Klein was very approachable and easy to talk to. He explained the IUI process in a simple manner and answered questions we had in lay terms, even though he knew I was a nurse and understood the process.  He was easy to get in touch with via text or email. Strengths: very knowledge about our treatments and possible causes of failure. He recommended things that could help improve egg quality (which I didn't do since I went to a different doctor who didn't recommend them). He also would take in consideration my suggestions/inquiries. I asked about improving sperm quality - use of Clomid which help increased my husband's morphology size. He would answer my email by the end of the day
Weakness: I would see a different doctor during monitoring hours. It's actually pretty hard to share my experience with her because I barely saw her in the 4 months with RMA. We had a none existent relationship.

Every time I went in for monitoring aka ""cattle call"" I saw a different doctor. They were all very nice and I'm sure great doctors but the problem is with these big clinics is that you really don't have one person truly dedicated to your success. 

IVF is all about timing. How can a doctor that hasn't even seen my ovaries make any sort of decisions on my cycle? And even if she wasn't there for all the visits, she never once called or emailed me to see how I was feeling. 

No one ever told me what my embryos were graded or was wrong with the embryos after testing. It was my first time doing IVF and didn't even know to ask.

I was never told any blood work results. I learned I didn't really know much about anything until I got my medical records to move over to a fertility doctor.

I also felt they dropped the ball with the last cycle. Then on about 5 days into this last cycle, a dr said there were only 3 eggs that looked mature. So I emailed Dr McAvey asking if she thinks there are only going to be 3 viable eggs then maybe we should cancel the cycle. We're paying this out of pocket so not trying to throw 15k out the window.

Then the next day she upped my dose drastically like a Hail Mary attempt to get some more eggs to mature. The day before retrieval my I believe my biggest one with over 23mm which is huge and one or 2 others over 20. I feel she pushed those to the limit to try to get some others to grow. We did a half dose of the trigger. Ended up with one abnormal embryo on day 5. So, I was right. 15k out the window.Although Dr. Grunfeld is clearly knowledgable and an expert in the field, he does not spend time with his patients or adequately explain risks or even the possibility of success with a procedure. Dr. Grunfeld was overly optimistic that my 2013 egg freezing cycle would yield good results. When the use of those eggs in 2018 was a total failure, he showed little compassion or concern and did not follow up with me and my husband to advice us on next steps.  I was shocked that Dr. Grunfeld showed little concern after my husband and I experienced two miscarriages from spontaneous pregnancy *and* a failed egg fertilization cycle in which my 24 eggs yielded 0 embryos that tested PGS normal. It was disheartening that we had to call his office numerous times to get even a short (5-minute) conversation with him and that his response was to simply suggest that we do another fresh IVF cycle.  I felt like a number and had no confidence that Dr. Grunfeld really cared whether my husband and I were able to conceive.First meeting, was good. But there were so many steps to take and it wasn't as clear as I would have liked, it felt quite scattered. He also seemed to want to create a total separation between himself and the finance/expense side. Like, you would sit with him and he would describe an endless list of tests and diagnostics, without any indication of what was necessary vs. lightly recommended, what was expensive and covered by insurance vs. what was typically out of pocket. He acted like he preferred to bury his head in the sand.He is clearly intelligent and experienced, but he is a terrible listener and does not customize your treatment.  I only met him twice, even though I had at least a dozen appointments under his care.  He was not present for any of my actual treatments- they were done by other doctors.  When our treatments (IUI) were unsuccessful, nothing was changed or investigated.  We were pushed hard towards IVF, and he did not feel we needed to do any sort of investigation into our undiagnosed infertility.When we first found out we had to do IVF, following the results from our first meeting with him, he was very human and caring. We went to see him, a bit devastated to the news, and he was very reassuring in providing us all the info we needed, all the steps, etc. 
He would answer every email, be okay to meet if need be, and always ready to give advice, always being very rational. 
We're still in the process of our first IVF, and having the transfer next week - hoping it will all go fine. So far, I'm very happy in working with Dr. Lederman. Dr Davis has an excellent bedside manner and does a great job thoroughly explaining different methods and approaches to treatment. He is very prompt in responding to emails and addresses any concerns. Communicating with Dr. Davis feels like a dialogue between two equal partners instead of a one-sided conversation.The doctor's strength and weaknesses cannot be conflated with the weaknesses of the clinic. The Doctor checked in, followed up, and kept me informed throughout the process. During one cycle of retrieval I barely saw her and she made sure to reach out. My experience was an eye opener on the reality of IVF treatment. I’ve always been afraid and believed it was a complicated process. Doctor McAvey made it sound very simple and hopeful. When we were unsure about the condition of my tubes she did a pelvic ultrasound immediately. We seemed like she genuinely cared about my husband and I and our journey. After having 4 ectopic pregnancies she showed tremendous compassion. Dr. Stein is very knowledgeable and realistic. I appreciate his management of expectations, while also providing hope.
 I thought he would be the one doing all my procedures and that I would be in direct contact with at all times. But this is not how RMA operates. So I've been mostly in contact with nurses and his staff. All very nice. 
I appreciate that he is available via phone or in person relatively easy. I came with questions and he answered all of them. But I had very little interaction with Dr Sandler - except for my first consultation and retrieval. He seemed to have little time for me and didn't answer my questions. I went to him because an acquaintance recommended him, but I would not have chosen him on my own - I should have listened to my gut.  Dr Copperman was extremely warm and understanding when I met with him during my initial consult. He was happy to answer all of my questions and address my concerns. He was realistic but not an alarmist. He also understood my mental and emotional state. I had come to him after my second chemical pregnancy in the 10 months I had been trying. He didn't initially propose the most aggressive course of treatment, but set my expectations as to when I should pursue those options. He did my IUI, and saw me during what was apparently a more critical monitoring session, and then was there to discharge me on my last visit.Dr. Lederman explained my options and tried to give me the pros/cons for each based on my health history and age. He has excellent beside manner and was very responsive to questions I had throughout the cycles in person while in monitoring, via email and through his coordinator. Due to the way the cycles work, I didn't always get to see Dr. Lederman for monitoring but he was always reviewing the cycle details. For the transfer and subsequent monitoring after positive pregnancy test, he was the only doctor I saw during the monitoring hours. Overall, I am very satisfied with his service.Dr. Stein is not the most ""warm and fuzzy"", but he is very compassionate and very direct. It is obvious that he cares about every patient that walks into his office. He is efficient and he is one of the most knowledgeable doctors I've met. He diagnosed conditions no one mentioned before and gave me clear feedback on how we were going to address various things. He listened to all of my concerns about going through IVF multiple times and made sure that I felt safe.Dr. Copperman is very knowledgeable in the field and seems to be on top of trends in the industry. In terms of personality, he is very robotic and difficult to engage. Over the course of treatment (including 3 transfers), he was seen only for the first.I was treated by Dr. Stein in 2014/2015 and then again in 2017/2018. He was recommended to me by my ObGyn who is absolutely fantastic. Throughout the treatment I felt very confident that I was in good hands and that Dr. Stein will achieve the best possible outcome. He was always honest with me and, most importantly, was available to answer any questions via email. Dr Flisser is a great doctor, but is also part of a larger group of doctors. The group seems to help set the overall standards of what is considered appropriate treatments and Flisser must work within those standards. He cares, he is very human and humane, but ultimately works in a system that is designed for what works for the most number of people and can only tailor a specific treatment for our needs within certain limitations. Dr. Copperman is an exceptional doctor and knows what he is doing. I trust hime with my medical care and although it has taken us awhile he is always ready to keep trying. However, he is not warm and fuzzy and this has been hard for us at times when we needed a bit of encouragement. He is very much a scientist reflecting on data and analysis to determine best course of treatment. I can't complain because we have so far gotten the results we wanted. So his system must work. It can also be hard to get an appt with him as he is VERY busy so sometimes it seems that you speak via the nurses to him versus hearing your plan straight from your doctor. RMA is a bit of a factory but it is convenient with quick monitoring hours available all over the city. And I have found the other doctors at RMA that I have seen during monitoring, egg retrieval, and FET transfer to be overwhelming competent and warm. I am very happy with the care I have received from doctor Davis. For me he is a great fit. I have a lot of questions and he answers them thoughtfully and thoroughly. During my procedures I have always felt I was in the most capable hands. I only once felt unsatisfied. I was prescribed a medication before a procedure that had pretty bad side effects (extreme cramping and a lot of bleeding). I was not told about the side effects by my doctor, nurse, or pharmacy. I am assuming Dr. Davis thought I would be told about the side effects by the nurse, or that they would atleast be included in the booklet that comes with the medication. It was very upsetting at the time, but I don't even know who is to blame. That is my only negative experience thus far, and I believe it was an honest mistake.Dr. Lekovich was able to answer questions that I had in a kind and professional way .  I love that she seems to know her patients by name even when she’s not in the examining room . My only gripe would be that she doesn’t answer emails when it’s sent .  I ended up asking my question in person but it works have been nice to get a reply via email . She was warm, friendly and compassionate .  She answers questions when asked . However when I asked questions after an ultrasound , at times I felt like she was in a rush to leave the room the minute ultra sounds were completed . I felt as if I had a question it would be almost impossible to get them answered . I know she had other patients but it made the care given by her very rushed . Dr. Flisser is an asset to the RMA community. He is a kind, caring, and well informed doctor who has helped me to navigate through an awful and emotional process in a compassionate and meaningful manner. Although he did not personally perform each of my IUIs, he was always involved with the treatment protocol. During a particularly difficult time for me, Dr. Flisser sat on the phone with me for 45 minutes reassuring me and helping me to understand what was going to happen. As I’m about to begin my ivf journey, I am absolutely confident in Dr. flisser’s abilities to get me my desired outcome.Dr Mukherjee is clearly a knowledgeable doctor and knows his field.  He always took the time to answer any questions either my husband or I had. Even though he was busy in the OR when I came to confirm my miscarriage he made sure that as soon as he was out, he called and spoke with me to make sure I was ok and to reassure me that he would get us pregnant. He was always calm, kind, compassionate and reassuring about the stress we were under during this process.I honestly really loved Dr. Thornton. At both my consultation appts, she spent at least 2 hours going over every step and procedure my husband and I would have to undergo. We had a particularly hard IVF cycle (8 of our 10 embryos didn’t make it after Day 4) and when I totally lost it sobbing in her office, she was so sweet and hopeful that those two embryos were all we needed. She made me feel comfortable asking any questions I had, and really tried to make sure I knew what was happening and when. I never felt like my visits were rushed or that I was just some name on a list of pts she had to get to that day. Dr Mcavey is very nice, but never had adjusted my fertility treatments. We have all this “unexplained reasons” which seems to get everyone of the hook, while this is costing us a lot of money. I wouldn’t liked my one on one with her especially after a failed IUIMy experience with Dr. McAvey has been fine. Whenever we speak she is kind and hopeful. I haven't actually interacted with her very much throughout the course of my treatment. I had an initial consultation with her before I started the IUI process (3 rounds), and then one more before starting my IVF retrieval cycle. Other than that, aside from one or two emails to answer a question, I didn't have any contact with her until she called to let me know my IVF failed to produce any normal embryos. It was only then that she let me know about taking CoQ10 to improve egg quality and to pursue acupuncture (which I had pursued on my own and told RMA I was doing). If you have questions, Dr. McAvey will absolutely answer them, via email or phone. But it's really up to the patient to proactively ask (and research/figure out WHAT to ask). When we found out there would be no transfer cycle for us, Dr. McAvey was optimistic and encouraged us to try again as IVF is really just ""a numbers game"". I think dr lederman is very warm and honest , extremely smart and really dedicates himself to his patients . He can't make pregnancy happen but he always makes me leave feeling hopeful and positive . He cares and the thing I like most is that I can always directly email him with questions or concerns I'll repeat what I had said before: Dr. Mukherjee at RMA was recommended by a friend, who hasn't had a successful fertility experience, but I trusted her recommendation. He was always kind and took time to email respond, sometimes quickly, sometimes after some days. When I did see him for consultation or ultrasounds though, I found that sometimes I didn't ask all my questions because he seemed very busy and rushed. He did call me personally though, when to tell me about my one frozen embryo not making it past Day 3 or Day 4, even after the nurse had called me after the bad news. I did an egg freezing cycle with him in July of 2019 (out of 4 follicles, only 1 egg was viable and was frozen) and then I tried an embryo freezing cycle again in February 2020, and this time, there were 5 follicles but again, only 1 egg was viable and was successfully fertilized by my partner's sperm, but didn't make it to Day 5. It was heartbreaking to then end up with nothing after spending $17,000 or so when all was said and done. At our last consultation, Dr. Mukherjee said our best chance was to try naturally as I had a low reserve and rather than spend tens of thousands of dollars, that was our best bet, but my partner and I decided to change to a different doctor at Weill-Cornell who has been very kind and thorough and spent over an hour with us at our first consultation, patiently. He was recommended by a different friend who had a successful IVF cycle with him. 
So in summary, Dr. Mukherjee was pretty much kind, but we just felt rushed each time we saw him and then at our last consultation to discuss the failed embryo, he seemed to be pessimistic about future fertility treatments and didn't really seem to hear us that we were thinking of a second child. Also, the only thing that changed about our protocol between the first egg freezing and the 2nd time which was embryo freezing, was that he added Clomid and Ganirelix to my protocol. I took all the Clomid prescribed (5 days) and 1 day of Ganirelix, but the result of 1 egg harvested was the same. In the initial consultation and on follow-up conversations about next steps, Dr. Copperman was very helpful, informative and empathetic. I felt like he really cared about our outcomes and was confident in his expertise during the transfer process which we had to modify at the last minute, switching from one embryo to two. His reasoning was clear and I felt confident in our decisions together. Dr. Flisser was always aware of everything that was going on with my cycle. He was super compassionate when I had a loss and gave me a great pep talk even though i didn't want to hear it. He was always willing to listen to me cry and always said something positive to try to make me feel better. He had an answer for everything. He's was my biggest cheerleader. Even though he didn't take my insurance, he still offered to complete the DNC after my MC when my OB wasn't available. For lack of a better phrase ""i love him"" and would recommend him to anyone and everyone. My first doctor couldn't compare. He was also stating that the Lab that his office worked with was much better than the one I had come from before, so he was able to somehow guarentee results even though it took 2 fresh cycles of IVF and 4 FETS  to yield 2 healthy children. And he was also willing to work with me financially as the cost of 10 IVF cycles out of pocket could be super costly. My husband and I came to see Dr. Copperman because we had both tested as carriers for a genetic disease. In June, he told us we would be pregnant by Thanksgiving. We then went through two rounds of egg retrievals, neither of which resulted in any viable embryos to test for the genetic disease and freeze. His only change between round 1 and 2 was to bump up the hormones - no additional testing for any unknown factors that caused the issues. When the 2nd egg retrieval didn't work, he treated us like we were the problem and left me wondering if I had unknown fertility issues. We switched to another doctor and I'm now pregnant after one very successful round of IVF, with four frozen embryos to spare. So clearly, the problem wasn't with me. I recognize this is all a bit magic, a bit of a crapshoot, but to have my IVF doctor treat me like an annoyance for not performing the way he assumed I would is really the icing on the cake of an already extremely rough experience.As this is my first IVF, I wish Dr. McAvey explained to me which treatment is choose for me and educate me a little bit more on what to expect.  I did most of my learning through reading and google online.  I wish I have more options available to me for me to consider if the 1st treatment failed. The only issue I really had is after 2 failed IUI's she never enforced my husband to do a sperm analyisis. Considering I had been pregnant 3 times naturally before coming to the clinic, I think they just assumed his sperm was healthy. It wasn't until I personally had to enforce it did my husband get his sperm analysis and now here we are 8 months later still not pregnant, but found out that my husband has 0% motility. My 40th birthday is this year, and we will have to make a big decision about IVF. I loved her bedside manner and how personal and sweet she was, but I felt like she would just increase my dosage of Clomid each month I didnt get pregnant and was chalking it up to unexplained infertility, and shouldn't have even allowed us to do IUI without him having a sperm analysis. Dr Stein is smart, experienced and knows his stuff. He explains things well and is a realist - a described pessimist. I think he did a good job with our egg retrieval, as he was very exacting about my timing and when to trigger. We got good results from the retrieval (though a lot of that is because of my eggs). 
I found the transfer VERY uncomfortable (I am not a great gyno patient) and he was incredibly impatient and unsupportive in the moment. My transfer took, but then I miscarried at 5.5 weeks, exactly the same time I had miscarried with my two natural pregnancies. Despite the fact that he had pushed for IVF to control for embryo quality, and then the embryo quality didn't seem to make a difference (they were PGD tested), he had no explanation for why I might have miscarried. He also was not overly sensitive and wanted to just 'try again.' he said it's a numbers game. He was very dismissive of my suggestions (other women in my family had a bicornuate uterus, but he immediately said I didn't have that). 
When I went to get a second opinion from another clinic, they suggested a different protocol. I brought that suggestion back to him and he was immediately dismissive, judgmental and unprofessional. He told me that clinic had a 'terrible reputation' (despite the fact that he had trained the doctor) and that their suggestions were off-base. This was a phone call, after not responding to my email for a few weeks. He claimed he had. Overall, he left a very bad taste in my mouth and I felt unsafe/uncared for in his care. I think he is very smart and knows his stuff but is very arrogant and not open-minded. While I think he likely provides good care overall and helps a lot of women have success, I would not recommend him to a close friend.  Dr. Kudesia was available to answer questions in person when we made an appointment.  She was clear, balanced and walked us through the available data on medicated cycles with IUI and IVF.  We are a couple with a lot of questions and she took her time to answer everything.  It never felt like she was trying to push us in a specific direction and she didn't get defensive when we questioned certain approaches based on our failed outcomes.  She took time to call us over the weekend after we found out about all our embryos failing to reach day 5.  It was devastating news, but we appreciated her call.  She is upbeat, cheerful and encouraged me to stay positive while recognizing that was hard to do. Dr. Sandler is very frank and honest about his anxieties, which is wonderful but also doesn’t help a patient stay positive when we may already be feeling despondent. However, he knows his stuff and takes very seriously his duty to get women pregnant. I trustes he was doing his best. When his business office completely miscommunicated what the cost of our experiences would be, he gave us ‘professional courtesy’  (my husband was a PGY1 in the Mount Sinai system and had gotten an MD/PhD at Mount Sinai as I well), generously taking care of basically one frozen transfer cycle. He was adamant that he didn’t want the unclear finances to be the stressor. I will never forget that. During the few times where I saw Dr. Davis I really liked him, but most of the time I was interacting with nurses, staff, and other doctors. My case is a bit different from most and I had to regularly remind each person I was in contact with. There was miscommunication between those people and it seemed that the staff/nurses/doctors did not read my chart. My big issue is with RMA as a practice. I don't think I realized how much of a problem it was until I left the practice upon moving. I felt that Dr. Flisser was going to help us be successful in having a child and he was.  There were setbacks when treatments didn’t work, however I felt that as long as Dr. Flisser didn’t give up on us, we shouldn’t give up on him.  He is very confident in his expertise and skills as a RE.  While his demeanor could be misconstrued as dismissive saying things like, “I’m the doctor.” I actually felt that was an important message for him to say and for me to hear.  We were more conecernes tbat his numbers spoke for our chance for success.  Dr. Flisser is definitely a numbers guy, but that does not mean that we were treated as a number.  He is invested in seeing his patients through to a positive and healthy pregnancy.I feel like I wasted my time and my insurance money with someone too busy to give me the individualized attention and care that I needed. 5 retrievals and 1 failed double FET and I feel like I completely wasted my time with him. All of my bloodwork and numbers show that a different approach was needed and with him there is zero thinking outside of the box. Factory. Number. You don't matter as a patient or a person. This was my second time using Dr. Lederman and we couldn't be happier.  He did his research before I came in and discussed things from our previous fertility treatments.  He always asked about how I was doing and was always wiling to answer any questions.  He also made it a point to say he is always available through email or if you call the office.  During my retrieval and transfer, I could see he cared by the way he spoke to myself and my husband.I was referred to Dr. Davis in early 2017, when I failed to resume a normal menstrual cycle after months off birth control (and failing the progesterone challenge, abnormal blood tests, etc.).  On my first visit, Dr. Davis was INCREDIBLY thorough and thoughtful.  He spent almost two hours with me and my husband, walking us through the female reproductive organs (this may sound simple, but there was A LOT we didn't know!), how various hormones effect follicle growth, ovulation, etc. and why, based on my blood tests, I might not be ovulating.  Over the course of six months, we tried various medications to induce ovulation - Clomid, Provera, and then injectables. With each cycle, Dr. Davis took time to explain how the medication worked and how he expected it would affect me / my body. He always took care to walk us through all of our various treatment options (pros and cons) and allowed us to choose the path that felt the most comfortable to us.  I am thrilled to report that I am now 18 weeks pregnant with our first child (it was a bittersweet day when we ""graduated"" from Dr. Davis to the OB/GYN)!

I am so grateful for the care and support I received while a patient of Dr. Davis.  I would also note that the downtown RMA office is small (compared to the large uptown location) and very efficiently run.  Everyone from the nurses to the finance staff were pleasant to work with (and very responsive to calls and questions along the way). I personally appreciated that Dr. Davis has a holistic approach to treatment and I took advantage of the on-staff nutritionist (Dara Godfrey) and took him up on suggestion to try acupuncture as well.  All in all, I think Dr. Davis is a phenomenal doctor with a wonderful bedside manner and I would highly recommend him and his practice to anyone undergoing fertility treatments.Dr Stein was excellent in understanding my history, breaking multiple issues causing infertility; explaining the risk factors associated with each issue; and how & when it requires treatment. He educated us on some of the misconceptions we had - ex: the chromosomal test results after 2nd miscarriage resulted in no abnormalities in the fetus. Therefore we had ruled out chromosomal abnormality as one of the reasons for miscarriage in our case. However, Dr Stein explained that if the tested fetus was male then only we could be absolutely sure that the sample was of the fetus. As in our case this was female, there was a chance that the sample may have been of the mother and not the fetus. 

If other things were not an issue, he suggested IVF as our best option. Although initially we were not sure whether we need to opt this as our first course, he patiently discussed and explained the complications of IUI given my history of Ectopic; and how there is an option to use the ICSI & PGS tested embryos to reduce the chances of miscarriage due to chromosomal abnormalities, thereby reducing 2 major risks. 

Dr Stein was present at most of monitoring sessions during retrieval and transfer cycle. He ensured all our questions were answered at these visits and also was available via. email if needed. He coordinated with my other doctors such as endocrinologist and hematologist whenever necessary. Even after the transfer cycle, there were instances where we assumed it was not going to be successful due to spotting/bleeding. However, Dr Stein was very reassuring at each visit; conducted extra blood and ultrasound monitoring whenever necessary; and adjusted the medications immediately when needed. 

I would highly recommend Dr Stein for his knowledge, experience and excellent care & service through out the process. He was empathetic as well as realistic, practical and above all highly trust worthy.    Dr. Thornton is nice and somewhat caring but she did not listen to me when I wanted to get the full work up done. I emailed her listed of test and Informed her that I would like to get all of the blood work out of they way. But that was not the case. I had to go for more blood work (that should have need done the first time around). They probably wanted to just be able to charge me the fee of an office visit. Dr. Thornton did not give me advice or answers on why I was miscarriage. She just offered to keep trying with IVF so RMA could rack in the cash Dr. Flisser has an extensive understanding of fertility, remains very current on the newest technologies, is incredibly patient and thorough, and ultimately helped us conceive our first child. We were trying to get pregnant for about a year, ended up doing two rounds of IUI which unfortunately didn't work, and finally ended up doing a retrieval using PGD, ICSI, and a 5 day transfer that worked. We are so incredibly thankful to Dr. Flisser for guiding us through this process, and have actually recommended some of our family members to RMA as a result.Dr Lederman is competent, trustworthy, kind, and got the results we wanted. I did 2 cycles of injections and IUI, which did not result in a pregnancy. We then decided to move to IVF, which was successful on the first try with a frozen cycle. We now have a beautiful, healthy daughter. We have 3 embryos in the freezer to use in the future as well, which is wonderful. I will go back to Dr. Lederman when its time for baby #2. My husband and I could not say enough good things about our experience with Dr. Stein and the staff at RMA. We sought a consultation after trying without success for one year. I also have cerebral palsy and was unsure if this affected our ability to conceive in anyway. It was extremely easy to arrange an appointment with the office and get everything started. The office returned phone calls and addressed all of our insurance questions. We had looked into engaging in care with two other institutions and had negative experiences with the office staff. 

Dr. Stein was extremely thorough and to the point in our first consultation, which put me at ease- especially knowing all the options that could be available to us. After some testing it was determined that we had male factor fertility (morphology) and Dr. Stein was very honest in his recommendations and made sure we understood what each would entail. He also figured out ways to do my examinations that kept me comfortable.  Dr. Stein was also always willing to answer questions via email and in the office during monitoring hours. He's has a very nice way of explaining your chances, being honest and ensuring you aren't wasting your time. But nicely. He knew when I should keep going and when I should switch tactics. He also knew when to start preparing me for more dramatic alternatives (egg donors). I thought he and his team were unethical because they kept pushing for procedures and tests that seem unnecessary- he looked at my blood reports and ultrasound and told me that I needed aggressive fertility treatment immediately-that while there was no bad news there was no good news either.
I'd been referred by my obgyn who told me that even though my results were excellent (he said ""your numbers are that of a woman 10 years younger"") he couldn't determine why I hadn't conceived after trying for 3 months and if I wanted I should speak to a fertility specialist to explore my options.Dr. Sandler is a wonderful physician who really cares about his patients. I loved that he adjusted my treatment plan and when things weren't working out with one medication, we switched it. Dr. Sandler is proactive, not just reactive, which is extremely important in the course of fertility treatment. Although RMA is very busy and truly runs a large-scale operation, I found them to be extremely sensitive, considerate, and reachable. Dr. Sandler is an amazing physician but he is not exactly ""warm and fuzzy,"" so I would keep that in mind if you are someone who needs a doctor who is more laid back. I found Dr. Sandler to be completely honest about expectations, while also maintaining a level of reassurance to me given my age and medical history. Not a good listener; talks without pause so you have to interrupt to say or ask anything. Did not tell us I had diminished ovarian reserve until at least 6 months after treatment started. Because we were instead told nothing was wrong with either of us we delayed treatment. He never told me that there was a possibility anything could go wrong during my IVF cycle other than not getting pregnant after transfer, so I was shocked, confused and devastated when he cancelled my cycle because I did not produce eggs. This is after he told me when my retrieval date would be without ever saying it was contingent on the stimulating medication working. I never knew not getting to retrieval was a possibility.Dr. Kudesia is just nice and explains things in a way like you are talking to a friend.  I had a good feeling about her since out 1st consultation in June 2016.  I only saw her a few times, since I have not started IVF yet, but she is my main doctor.  To be honest I didn't really feel like a patient of Dr. Mukherjee's. I saw/spoke with him only a hand of times and it was mainly to receive bad news, when a cycle failed. I do not feel like I developed a patient/doctor relationship with Dr. Mukherjee given the amount of time spent together and lack of personalized attention to my case. He is a nice person, very well experienced in the field, and he will answer questions if you have them but he (and RMA) seem to be very set on their standard mode of operations. I think Dr Mukherjee / RMA is fine if you fit into their standard protocol but not so if you need personalized attention. Initially, Beth seemed sympathetic to my feeling of helplessness but as more treatments happened, she didn't take the time to explain to me why the treatments kept failing. I would've liked to spend more time understanding what we could do to find out if there are other underlying problems with me or my husband in order to better our odds. Maybe there's no way but at least we have explored some options but unfortunately we haven't had the chance to do so yet.Dr. Flisser is very smart and very honest. He is also open to hearing patient's concerns and is willing to think outside box. For example, although RMA doesn't really believe in immunology protocols, Dr. Flisser was supportive and still worked with me when I went to see one because he knew it was something I really wanted. Dr. Flisser is not only an amazing doctor but he is an amazing person. The night before my egg retrieval I realized I did not have the medicine for my trigger shot. Dr. Flisser drove to the office and to my apartment and hand delivered the medication to me. I have been to three RE's now and he is truly the best.Dr. Copperman does things quickly. He talks fast, he moves through visits very quickly. It was a little dizzying the first visit, but you get used to the pace. Despite that, he always responds to my emails, usually with a phone call. I don't feel rushed when I'm with him, but he is efficient. He's not going to chat about the weather. I believe he listens to me and respects that I know a lot about my own body. I am still currently in treatment, so I can't say if he has helped us achieve our goals yet, but I feel confident that he will. Or he will at least do his very best.  I had a positive experience with Dr. Mukherjee. Overall he is an experienced doctor and throughout my treatment he was kind and clear when he communicated information to me. He answered all my questions and doubts. 

It is important to note that Dr. Mukherjee is part of the RMA practice, so at the end you don't see/talk to your doctor often, as you also interact with other doctors from the practice. So expect not to have your own doctor present at all ultrasounds checkups /retrieval procedure. 

Also note that RMA, at least the office in Madison Ave. is a very crowded place. Still I thought it was clean and extremely well organized. All RMA staff including  doctors, nurses and assistants were all kind and extremely responsive to questions and requests of support. He's a great, smart doctor with a lot of experience.  If he's not pushed, he will tell you what he thinks and move on.  But if you have questions, concerns, alternative treatment protocols, he will give them serious consideration, discuss with you and follow ultimately what you want to do (assuming it is medically sound).  I suppose he would be great for a very passive patient (i.e., one who wants a doctor who sets the course without much input) or a very active one.  For middle of the road types who want a bit more but don't ask for it, he may not be the right choice.See previous comment and below.

Dr Copperman was brilliant where and when it counted. I think he assumed certain knowledge - perhaps because he knows I had been through multiple cycles in the past or perhaps because his nursing team should have briefed me - certain things weren’t explained very well to me and caused me days of anxiety needlessly. This may be a comment more appropriate for the clinic...?I've worked with Dr. Flisser twice, once to freeze eggs when I was 35 and more recently with my husband when we had trouble conceiving on our own. We went through 2 IVF (w/ICSI) cycles with Dr. Flisser and for both decided to do PGS as well. We're now due with a baby boy in a couple of months. I know others who have had infertility challenges and one thing I like most about Dr. Flisser's approach is that he covers all the bases up front. In other words, we did IVF (w/ICSI) with PGS on our first cycle rather than trying IUI and then the next time trying IVF and then the next time trying IVF with PGS which is what some friends who worked with other clinics/doctors experienced. I also liked that Dr. Flisser performed complete testing up front so that we knew everything we may be challenged with early and could address early. Dr. Flisser's demeanor is pretty direct and to the point, which I really liked because I wasn't given false promises or hope, just the facts in what was already an emotional time. I would recommend Dr. Flisser over and over again and plan to work with him again in a few years when we're ready for baby number 2. He's very blunt which I prefer. I don't need a doctor who's going to hold my hand but rather give me the good, bad, and ugly straight up. You don't always see him during monitoring hours because the doctors rotate and I preferred to go to a more convenient location which was closer to my office. Dr. Flisser got us the results we wanted - a perfectly healthy pregnancy. He was very honest and candid about the best treatment options. Even when we didn't get to see him, we felt confident he was monitoring our case, and dictating our treatment. He was always friendly, professional, and clear.First off, our background might be a piece of cake for Dr Stein. We are both just over 30 trying for a year. My hubby has very active spern counts. I am skinny but all good otherwise. Dr. Stein is quick and sharp. He pointed out my weight is the problem and how human body is smart to know when is safe to get pregnant and asked us to comeback for him when we are ready to be parents. We came 6mo later and one negative preganancy test on clomed and natural intimacy and one IUI which we succeeded and now I am 9 weeks in. Dr. Stein is very scientific and accurate and won't hide anything if he feels so. He reacts quick to test results he sees. This might be the right way to do it although sometimes it could give us some mental stress. In the end it turned out that he did the right thing and made right decisions. He has good humor too and always said willing to give me some fat from him which made me laugh. Anyways overall good experience with Dr. Stein and hope all the best with our first one!Jeffrey klein is a wonderful doctor with excellent bedside manner. He takes his time with every patient and never makes you feel like a number. I have yet to have success with a frozen embryo transfer at RMA but I do not believe it is Dr Kleins fault. He has talked me through every step and answers my emails 24/7(when does he sleep haha). Overall a wonderful doctor.Dr Copperman is amazing.  Truly the best.  I feel like I can give a very fair accurate assessment of him because I can compare him to 3 other doctors I did IVF treatments with as well as many others I did consultations with.  Dr Copperman took the time to really get to know us and understand everything we had been trying before him to get pregnant.  He thoroughly explained his approach and showed us the science and data behind our chances based on our stats which I found very helpful.  He was so incredibly warm, supportive but also informed and incredibly knowledgeable.  He was with us every step of the way, always available to me by phone or e-mail and ensured that we knew what was coming, he was there for all of my procedures, retrieval and transfer.    I truly felt like he partners with us and wanted this for us just as much as we did.  I continue to stay in touch with Dr. Copperman, my beautiful daughter has met him and I knew his joy to meet one of his babies and hold her in his arms!I had a mixed experience. I was a patient of Stangel (whom i did 4 IUI’s and 1 IVF resulting in 1 love birth and 1 vanishing twin) whom retired, so I was given to Klein as a result. I liked him but i felt different than I felt with Stangel. He was great with email and when I asked him to do my IUI with injections he didn’t want to but after convincing him that I knew the risks, he did it and that gave me my second son 😊When I met this dr he was very nice and looked into my eyes saying "" I will get you pregnant."" This doctor is pretty set in his ways and is not open to patient suggestions. Ive had several failed IVFS prior to seeing him so I knew what to expect. I have a tendency to make many eggs and embryos and they all arrest. He basically did the same IVF stim cycle as my previous dr and just lowered the medication dose a bit. He did not  take my MTHFR seriously and said I do not need to take baby aspirin or lovenox. I ended up getting 2 poor quality but PGD tested normal embryos with him. They only made it to blast on day 6 and 7. He only let me transfer one and it stuck! I had to ask him to check my thyroid levels which he neglected to check and they were high! I had to start medication immediately since I was currently pregnant but it takes over a month for the medication to work. I ended up miscarrying.  My progesterone levels were on the lower side and he didn't seem to care.  He never called to apologize about my miscarriage which I found hurtful. I felt like I slid between the cracks because I look young and he probably figured it would be an easy cycle. I will never forget when I asked him why I miscarried a normal embryo and he answered "" you are just unlucky"".I think Dr. Grunfeld is a good ""doctor"" and by that, I mean a scientist. I think he ""knows his stuff"" and is generally a decent person. My chief complaint is that he was way too overly optimistic when I first started and, as a consequence, I was extremely shocked by what happened and where I am now. When I went to see him about IVF, he made it seem like a fait-accompli that I would have a baby.  And it all went well -- until it didn't. I had one embryo from my first round that genetically tested normal and implanted.  I miscarried it, and it turned out the fetus had Down's Syndrome. Dr. Grunfeld never communicated to me that PGS was not 100% (I am sure I signed something that said I know). I would have appreciated a little more caution from him and a little more sympathy.  When I went in for my follow up appointment, he didn't remember that the fetus had Down's and was not prepared.  This was upsetting.  He also urged me to another round which I did.  I got 10 eggs but no PGS-normal embryos. When I went to see him for my next follow-up appointment, he told me to keep going but I could not at that point as my insurance had run out. I then did an IUI where I really felt like an afterthought to him and the clinic. Overall, it was a disappointing experience though I don't really blame Dr. Grunfeld. She was professional, kind and ultimately got the job done!

I think her only weakness is that she seems young and my husband and I sometimes found her manner of speech to be a bit millenial-esque. But that's being very nit-picky! Dr. Sandler was mostly straightforward during my treatment.  I did feel that there were times he overexplained things and didn't focus on the details I wanted to hear.  However he answered all of my questions as they arose, and I did feel confident he had my best interest in mind.  My treatments were a success with Dr. Sandler, and after 2 rounds of IUI and 2 rounds of full IVF, I am currently 18 weeks pregnant.Eric has a fairly laid back attitude, but he is willing to sit and answer as many questions as you have.  When I did see him, he was patient and thorough in his explanations.  He is thorough when asked questions, but does not proactively provide a lot of information. It was my first time doing any fertility treatment, so more information regarding expectations and how I was progressing along the way would've been helpful.  But if you know what to expect and what questions to ask, you should be ok.  I only saw Dr. Flisser a couple of times...during my first consultation, on day one of my cycle for monitoring and maybe twice more quickly for monitoring. A different doctor did my retrieval, whom I had never met, based on the day my retrieval fell and their schedules for doing retrievals.  Overall, I think Flisser is a nice guy and is smart/very knowledgeable about fertility treatments.  I didn't get the feeling he was paying close attention to my treatment and was invested in my outcome (even if he was, I didn't get that feeling).  The communication and follow up with the doctor wasn’t great post cycle.  My cycle was unsuccessful and I had questions about options for another cycle and I had to follow up several times to get answers.I like the Dr. Klein is so easy to reach. He always answers my emails right away, and I feel like he knows who I am as a patient of his. Not just someone whose chart he has to check before each visit. On the rare ocassion I had to see another doctor, Dr. Klein always called me himself to check up on me, go over results. Its hard to point out any flaw with the care we received from Dr. Stein and the entire RMA team. 

- Dr. Stein is actively involved - from sales-pitching the practice to you on your first meeting, most morning monitoring,  determining, tweaking, explaining the protocols, in close contact during the retrieval process and  personally performing the implantation procedure. He even helped match us up with the right OBGYN upon release, based on where we live and our history. 

Dr. McAvey did a great job monitoring my first and only IVF cycle after 7 failed iuis at a different clinic. I have endometriosis but there was no clear reason for my infertility. She was extremely positive about my chances. I think I ended up being an easy patient because I ended up responding very well to the stimulation cycle. When my e2 spiked and I was in danger of hyperstimulating, she canceled my fresh transfer so that my body could recover. She did a great job of monitoring my follicle growth so I triggered at the right time for the maximum number of eggs retrieved. I ended up with 31. She also pressured me gently to only transfer one embryo, because she thought my chances were so good, and I really wanted to do two. IVF is obviously an easier experience on a patient when it's so successful, so it's only natural that I highly regard Dr. McAvey.  It's hard to know if I would have gotten the same great outcome the first time with anther doctor. I still have 11 frozen embryos waiting to be our baby's sibling. Over all I liked Dr. Copperman, I do wish I saw him more. His bed side manner is decent, although he can have a bit of a sarcastic way about him which can be good for some and bad for others. He used a different protocol than my previous doctor which I liked and seemed more appropriate for someone my age dealing with diminishing ovarian reserves. He is thorough, but this can also be to his detriment.  He spends a lot of time spouting facts and figures that don't necessarily apply to you (for example I'm 32, I don't particularly care about the success rates for women 40+ or risks for them).  We were also very under-prepared for a lot of things that happened along the way-- stopping our first cycle (nobody had ever mentioned that might happen), transferring more than one embryo (we had only ever been told, for years, that one embryo would be transferred due to my age), an ectopic outcome.Dr. Stein is very accessible and usually very warm. We have his email address and he always writes back promptly with detailed answers. I am someone who asks a lot of questions and who wants to know every little detail. I also have a lot of anxiety around this process which means I do a lot of research and ask a lot of questions to many different people on the subject (RE, OB, PCP, nutritionist, acupuncturist, friends/coworkers who have gone through this, 2nd opinions...anyone). He puts up rather well with my many questions that arise from looking at so many sources. I also appreciated that he wasn't pushy about any sort of particular treatment. He very plainly explained the options to us based on our situation. He told us the laid back approach, all the way through the very aggressive approach, the pros and cons of each option, and then let us decide. It doesn't seem to be about money with him - he truly seems to want us to get pregnant with a viable baby, and not just for money or to ""up"" his numbers. I really believe he cares. So far in our treatment he has been right in all of his opinions of what our fertility issues are. We aren't out of the woods yet, but I've been seeing him for just over a year now and we are definitely very close to a viable pregnancy with our own sperm and eggs. I have more hope now than I had before. Also, he always recognizes me when he sees me in the waiting room. He has so many patients, and yet he knows who we are. (Maybe he only remembers me because I'm crazy, but I don't think so - he seems to remember lots of people). It feels more personal, instead of me just being another number. UPDATE: We seem to be out of the woods now! After my 2nd embryo transfer (both with genetically tested single embryo) I am now almost 16 weeks pregnant! (1st embryo transfer with genetically tested embryo did result in a pregnancy, but he thought it was a chemical pregnancy as it miscarried very shortly after the positive pregnancy test). This current pregnancy - my 5th one - is the first one to make it this far by a mile. It's the first one I ever even heard a heartbeat. I'm still only cautiously optimistic because of all of the miscarriages prior to this, but we have hope!  Dr. Sandler is incredibly knowledgeable and often explained what was going on in great, scientific detail.  I'm a science nerd so I appreciated having this information, but he sometimes presented the information just as information giving me little indication as to how this information would affect my husband and I in real life.  It seemed like he was using a ""flow chart"" of sorts where if treatment A didn't work then we move on to treatment B without necessarily considering me, my history or how the previous treatment went.  He was somewhat personable, but I wouldn't say his bedside manner was always great.  Sometimes it seemed as if he wanted to succeed with us more to advance his own ego than to give us sometime we want so badly. Dr. Knopman was confident that she could help me and that confidence transferred to me. When we sat down to make a game plan I felt like a weight had been slightly lifted. She had a plan and we were going to make that baby! She made sure to see me whenever she was in the office and she performed all of my procedures (egg retrieval and embroyo transfer). When I had spotting early in my pregnancy, she had me come in right away to alleviate my fear that something was wrong. She is also very down to earth and will chat with you about other things going on in your life so you don’t feel so stuck in your infertility bubble when you’re at the office practically every day. I will be returning to Dr. Knopman whenever I am ready for baby #2. If anything, I should've made more attempts to communicate with her as she would've made herself available. For example, I had a side effect to one of the meds I was on but because I read about it as expected in the paperwork, I didn't say anything. But when I brought it up at my next appointment, Dr. McAvey said I should've told them. I didn't know that I could/should. That was frustrating but, again, I know if I had reached out I would've gotten a response. For example, once when I did have a question, as she was running out of the office, she told me she'd call me on her cell from her car. She was really straightforward, smart and kind. There were a few times when I wish she had been more familiar with my file but I recognize that all of these doctors see sooooo many patients, I feel like it's actually our patient responsibility to do a lot of reminding with each and every appointment. I asked the director of a prominent cryopreservation lab about her and she had nothing but good things to say about her as well.Dr Talebian was very caring and took extra time to talk to me and answer calls. She was not always there and not always the doctor on call to help me. It was hard to tell in my case because the results of the very expensive procedure were not what I wanted or had hoped for, so it was overall disappointing. She handled that well I think, though I never felt I had as much time as I wanted with her.I have already explained how appalling Dr. Stein's ability to communicate and explain my treatment, protocol, goals and outcomes was in a prior answer.   Here, I'd like to respond about how bad the medical treatment was, too.  I told Dr. Stein that my body responds very badly to birth control pills and that was why I've never been on them for any length of time.  Nonetheless, he put me on them and I got a cyst right away and we couldn't go forward with my cycle.  Then, having immediately gotten a new doctor, it was immediately clear I was triggered much too early.  No wonder I got only 4--yes 4--eggs, only 1 of which was mature!!!  In my next egg retrieval I got 12 eggs a few months later, 8 of which were mature and in my most recent retrieval - 5 years later at 39 years old I got 10 eggs, 9 of which fertilized and resulted in 6 Day blastocysts.  So the numbers speak for themselves.  Terrible communication and medical care from Dr. Stein.  Save your time, heart and money and go elsewhere as fast possible. She was great and made us feel very comfortable. When we had bad news she was honest and kind and gave her opinion of what she would do if she was in our position, which I appreciated. When she had good news she was as excited  as we were. I appreciated Dr. Klein and his honesty with my diagnosis and its relation to my chances of natural conception.  He kept me informed, and was often available by email outside of business hours if questions were to arise.  Although I understand he is a top rated doctor in this field, he was not the appropriate provider for me; my issues were more challenging and I do not feel that he was able to exercise any creative approaches to my care, as my subsequent doctor had done.  Dr. Klein was very kind and compassionate, and a true professional.Dr Stein listened to what I wanted, and provided a plan that worked for me. He explained why he recommended or didn't recommend a particular course of treatment and gave direct feedback on how I was doing.Dr Talebian was completely professional, smart, compassionate, knowledgable, caring and very kind. My experience with her was EXCELLENT! I am currently about to start another IVF cycle for a second child and I tracked her down at her new clinic (CCRM) just to make sure she was my doctor again. I recommend her highly!!! Pregnancy did not result from my treatment with Dr. Knapman, which skews my response, but overall I thought she was fine. I wish she had considered factors such as diet, potential immune or lifestyle issues, or suggested supplementary treatment or investigation of the reason that my transfer of a seemingly healthy embryo did not work. Upon completing treatment with her, I have spoken to many other people who mention their doctors suggesting acupuncture, reaching an ideal weight, tracking basal body temperature to determine ideal transfer time, etc. There was very little discussion about any of those things - I was especially concerned with the timing of IUI because I was using frozen donor sperm which does not stay alive as long as fresh sperm, but she seemed to apply a formulaic approach. Overall, she was nice and seemed to know her stuff, and did a great job with the egg retrieval, but she did not deviate from standard Western medical procedures at all, and did not seem to take the nuanced approach that I've heard other friends describe their doctors taking. I am back to trying naturally for the time being, but will seek out a different doctor when my partner and I move on to fertility treatments again.He is obviously a brilliant dude, but there were times I felt like he spoke down to me, as if I couldn't possibly understand the intricacies of ART treatments, when in reality I was reading academic journal articles regularly to try to know as much as possible.he was pushy and didn't listen. he made up his mind early and never made eye contact I never knew what to expect. when i finally got him to actually call me back he rushed me and treated me like i was an idiot. When i ovulated thru the stims he blamed me instead of the fact the monitoring doctor's should have caught the LH spike. A horrible experience. He was fine.  He seemed honest and open and nice.  But he wasn't involved much in my care that I could see.  The facility is so big that he was a very small part of my care.  I was always told that he was ""reviewing"" my data, but I never heard from him.  dr flisser was extremely helpful throughout this process.   He spent a lot of time with us discussing each of the various procedures and the risks/increasing of odds with each added step.   My husband and I appreciated that he was very much an odds guy, he helped us understand what would increase our chances, but without escalating too fast.  He was helpful in assisting us on when to escalate (after 3 months of clomid/letrozol w/trigger shot, we added iui).  

I was frustrated in this process by not having a clear cut diagnosis and thus in my head a clear path to solving  the problem in getting pregnant.  For much of the process, I spent time focusing in trying to figure out what was wrong and not working.  After all the initial tests came back clear and there was anything that was an obvious problem, dr flisser seemed to easily accept the ""unexplained fertility"" diagnosis and really focus on how to get us pregnant.  For my husband, that was great, for me, who really wanted to understand why my body wasn't functioning, it was frustrating.  By the end of the process (9 months later- 3 med cycles, 3 med + IUI cycles, 1 egg retrieval and 1 transfer cycle) and a pregnancy (currently 24weeks), I'm a little more at ease with not having a  diagnosis 

At roughly 8 out of 10 monitoring apts we saw Dr flisser, with the exception of our egg retrieval cycle.  Unfortunately, our first retrieval cycle happened to fall during the Jewish holidays, so we saw him on day one of the cycle, and then he was off on holiday- while not in office, he was monitoring our progress with the staff via email and did adjust a few of my meds as needed.  At the beginning it didn't bother me that I wasn't seeing our dr, as the other drs we saw were reassuring, but as we got closer to the retrieval and I began to realize I wouldn't see him before or for the retrieval I started to freak out.  It seemed a little unsettling to go through the entire egg retrieval process and only see our actual dr once. After speaking with the nurses about my fears, they got in touch with Flisser and he called me with reassurance that he'd been monitoring my case and that in his opinion everything looked great for a good retrieval.  I asked if he could possibly do the retrieval the next day and he said he'd try.   He did end up performing our retrieval, which definitely put me at ease.  

While Dr Flisser, is good at explaining the medical process and odds, he's not the most warm and fuzzy. He's direct when presenting information and results.  You will not be chatting about your weekend plans or laughing at jokes during your apts.  while he will take the time to reassure you if you have doubts, he will not be one offering hugs or show much emotion throughout the process.  For me and my husband, we were ok with this and the nurses are incredibly helpful with empathy and emotional breakdowns. 

Overall we were happy to have Dr Flisser on our team during this incredibly stressful process full of no guarantees and lots of uncertainty.  Flisser did not seem to be an expert in diminished ovarian reserve.  He was not particularly encouraging based on my high FSH numbers and low antral follicle count.  He was not willing to proceed with retrieval with a low number of follicles ,  which for me seem to be inevitable and with a different doctor at anotehr clinic, l I was able to proceed even though I had only produced four or five follicles and I had a successful pregnancy based on that procedure .  With Flisser there was also a whole situation where he thought I had an ectopic pregnancy  and was recommending that I have a shot to induce a chemical abortion .  I was certain that it was not ectopic but merely a blighted ovum which I had experienced in the past, and knew the symptoms of. I didn't want to take the pill because it would delay our next IVF cycle for several months, which is a bigger headache than it sounds like given the proliferation of days the clinic is closed in January, not to mention the very strong ticking of my biological clock given the DOR.

In the end, I did not take the shot against his advice and it turned out it was not an ectopic but merely a blighted ovum as I had suspected.  

I think Flisser was erring on the side of caution, but this whole situation really left a bad taste in my mouth. He wasn't physically there for the after-hours appointment where the nurse was trying to push the abortion shot on me. He did, however, talk to me on the phone about it, which I suppose is generous of him. 

But in general, the situation made me feel like maybe fertility doctors like him aren't experts in early pregnancy in which case they should really refer patients to someone else instead of trying to diagnose things that are not within their realm of expertise.I saw Dr Copperman after working with another clinic that couldn't give me a reason for why my cycle  didn't work. I wasn't really planning on doing another IVF cycle, but I agreed to go for a consultation with him. At that first meeting, he was able to tell me why he thought the first cycle didn't work, and what he would do differently. He seemed sure that he could get me pregnant. 

We ended up doing several cycles with him. Each time something didn't work, he tweaked. I thought he would want us to go to donor egg after the first failed cycle, but he didn't. The fact that I had low ovarian reserves didn't scare him, and he was willing to keep trying new protocols. 

In the end, we ended up using donor eggs because our chances with my eggs was too low. But it was a decision my husband and I made with Dr Copperman, and neither one of us felt that it was a rushed decision or something that was done because he was afraid of negative results lowering the clinics score. We felt like he was willing to work with us, provide us with information, and make sure we understood the reasons behind his choices. I came into my first appointment with some fears about what it would take to get my baby (babies as it turned out!). Dr Mukherjee was very cheerful and seemed right at the edge of all the research I had done myself. He recommended we start with the medication I had read about for my specific problem. I'm an info-seeker so I continued to pore over my lab results and find new research about specific numbers and factors. I emailed the doctor a couple times with articles that concerned me, and it was clear he had accounted for that data and could explain what applied and did not apply in my case. He was reassuring but trustworthy, in my opinion, and didn't seem overly confident. Just enough that I could get through and feel like ""of course SOMETHING will work, just a matter of finding what will"". Dr. Lederman was great with me.  He was willing to sit with me and explain things.  He would always answer any questions that I had.  If I called, he would call me back personally and not have a nurse call me.  I truly felt like he was vested in helping me get pregnant.  Not once did he encourage me to give up.  He always let me feel like I had control over what was happening in my treatments.We successfully conceived our first baby under Dr. Copperman and his team's care.  We chose him as our doctor based on a friend's recommendation as well as personal research of his background/qualities.  Dr. Copperman's knowledge and dedication to his patients' needs and plan is remarkable.  We never once doubted his plan for us, as he was very confident in what would ultimately work for us.  Despite not seeing Dr. Copperman at every monitoring appointment, we trusted his team of doctors.  Since all the RMA doctors work very closely together, we knew we were in good hands.  He was very realistic and honest, which was an aspect we really appreciated.  I remember the exact appointment when he told me that ""why go through a third failed IUI, when I expect that you will be pregnant by your 1st IVF cycle.""  Despite how hard it was to hear certain news during the emotional process, we knew we could trust Dr. Copperman's expertise to guide us to conceive as easily/quickly as possible.  Even at Dr. Copperman's level, he took the time to speak to us thoroughly about our concerns and answered all of our questions throughout the journey.  We couldn't be more grateful for all that RMA has done for us, especially Dr. Copperman.I felt I was in the hands of a true expert who is one of the top in his field. I knew about Dr. Grunfeld's excellence and knowledge, yet his humble and down to earth personality made me feel that he was approachable and truly cared about the outcome of our treatments (Not just my payments). I felt like he had a lot of patients.  That I had 5 minutes to squeeze in his information and any of my questions (and felt more than 3 questions was a little too much or to be discussed with nurse).  I felt more like he was following a set way of doing things.  Like patient A comes in on first visit.  Tell them to do x, y, z and then if that doesn't work do this next thing.  I didn't feel it was tailored to me or my situation.Our experience with Eric Flisser was extremely positive.  From the first time we met with him, we felt very comfortable with him.  We completely trusted his recommendations and guidance through this very confusing process.  When I got my first negative pregnancy test - he called me that afternoon to see how I was doing.  He didn't even call to explain, he just called to ""check in"".  When I started crying on the phone, he didn't rush me off.  I will never forget how grateful I felt for that call.  It showed me that he was just as disappointed as I was.  He is really a great doctor and we would recommend him to anyone!Dr. Grunfeld is very knowledgeable and knows what he is doing.  He personalay follows his patients through their treatments and he makes the decisions about medications and timing.  Not all doctors do that, even at RMA.  We got pregnant very quickly while working with Dr. Grunfeld.  Some people say he is not warm and fuzzy and I am sure there are doctors who rate higher on that metric, but he is not cold, and gets resultsDr. Knopman was completely lovely and extremely knowledgeable.  I never felt she talked down to me, and she kept me absolutely as informed as I wanted to be throughout the entire process.  She did an excellent job as evidenced by results and also my personal experiences with her.he is a talented doctor but definitely lacks bedside manner.  You go to him for his expertise and success rates, not because he is going to make you feel warm and fuzzy.  I liked seeing other doctors in the practice who were a little warmer, but knowing that he was reviewing all the blood work and sonograms was good.  i did have some losses, one in particular that was devastating, and he was very helpful. at the end of the day i owe my two amazing sons to him.I interviewed one other doctor and much preferred Dr. Klein.  Convenience was a factor but I also prefered Dr. Klein's manner.  He did not recommend medication for me (at age 36) and the other doctor did.  I got pregnant on my first try, with two back to back IUI's.  I didn't love that when I talked about tracking my fertility he called that the ""loosy goosy method.""  I actually found ovulation predictor kits ineffective but have a good sense of when I'm ovulating, so didn't need them.  I also was on thyroid medication and dropped off my blood test results with him, expecting that he would manage that, but I got the feeling that he never looked at them, and was told by the receptionist that he wouldn't.  That's fine.  I found another endocrinologist to manage that during my pregnancy, but would have felt much safer being told that right away.  I didn't know what questions to ask.  I still recommend him, but recommend that you make sure to ask if there are any concerns so you know what is in his domain and what isn't.  All in all, I got what I went there for and ended up very happy.  Oh- inseminations had to be performed in the city but I was able to have all the testing done in White Plains.Dr. Lederman is extremely thorough, at our first appointment he went through so much it was a bit overwhelming. He talked so fast I tried to take it all in but once he started talking to me about my history, he was very personable. I became very confident in his abilities.We have been seeing Dr. McAvey for a long period of time, since the first consultation until i got pregnant for the second time. I’m 40 years old so i knew it could take some time. She has always been incredible. She is very approachable and compassionate. She explains everything in detail and is very knowledgeable and professional. We were always very happy she was our doctor and we recommended her to everyone we knew was looking for a fertility doctor.I only had a chance to meet him once for a consultation and didn't have much interaction with him as of yet. I am in the middle of cycle (waiting for a cycle to start) so I don't have much to say about his care. Dr. Stein seems confident and positive. He is very clear when explaining what each cycle will look like. He has many years of experience, including many awards for his work in the field.  Unfortunately, I have only met with him twice during my cycle, including the consultation. Often times, I see his nurse or another doctor that works in the office.Dr. Kimberley A. Thornton is caring and kind. She answered all my questions and gave us suggestions for our treatments. She thought we had a good chance during our consultation. We had 2 IUIs and 4 IVFs with her for 10 months. My embryos didn't last until day 5 and I never had a transferred with total 50 eggs retrieved as RMA doesn't do day 3 transfer. We tried differnt protocols for my IVFs but still no good news. I feel she is supportive and responsive. I wished we tranferred to another clinic sooner.Dr. Mukherjee never gave up on me - even during the times I wanted to give up. I always felt like he had a genuine, vested interest in a positive outcome for me and my family. 
At RMA, you will not always see your doctor for monitoring. Dr. Mukherjee was always available for a call or follow up appointment if I had additional questions or concerns. I would've appreciated a more thorough consultation. My case isn't a particularly complicated one, but I felt that I was brushed off rather than engaged for what my concerns were. I also felt that my concerns were met with a don't-worry-about-it sort of response rather than answered more directly and thoroughly. I'm detailed oriented and felt that the response was a bit disconcerting.He is a great doctor, really  smart and knows what he is talking about.
I know is difficult for me to get pregnant and that sometimes is difficult to talk about it but he manages to explain everything in a way he makes me feel confident but also down to earth. Is difficult to explain. Many of my friends go to RMA, but see other doctors. They are shocked when I describe how I am being treated. During an endometrial biopsy, I made a noise because it hurt, and he said to me “don’t do that.” I felt awful. When I had a miscarriage he never contacted me to talk. I had to call the office and begged to speak to him. I don’t understand why he is treating my case like this.Dr. Lekovich was great in terms of taking time to answer my questions and she was compassionate to my situation. I feel like what was not communicated to me was the possible outcomes after the retrieval in terms of what to expect regarding the number of eggs retrieved, embryos fertilized and how many may not be viable. You don't see him often during your treatment, but he's always happy to get on the phone with you to answer any questions.  

Thoughtful, informed, and open to collaboration (we tried a med recommendation I'd found in a recent study for PCOS patients that his team hadn't done before: it worked to get me to ovulate but unfortunately did not result in pregnancy.)Dr. Sandler always explains me for everything. And to the point. I get the result with satisfaction. Couple times he did ultrasound for me due to my poor egg quality, so he can decide that time what next step. For me it’s good, he take care of patient as a human. He can answer all my questions. I always happy with his answer.He’s an expert in his field and has been doing this longer than most. At this point he knows my history and has given me my amazing child so it’s hard to have negative feelings, but I do which he were a little more aware of the psychological and emotional implications of this process. She is friendly and understanding. She took her time with my husband and I and gave us thorough explanations. She is excellent at putting me at ease, which I experienced when doing the saline sonogram. Years ago I had a terrible experience with the hsg and was nervous. She is good at making conversation and is pleasant all around. I had Dr. Copperman before, she is a million times better. I have seen MANY doctors in the office. Dr. Grunfeld has called me a few times to explain next steps. I wish that questions were answered at the time of the visit, however. I find that I have to call into the office or email the nurses with questions. He also isn’t the doctor that does my retrieval, but I know timing does play a factor in this. Dr. Lekovich was very understanding and knowledgeable. As a patient she was realistic about the process and took the time to explain and answer any questions I had. Being that I was only in health care for a short time I still think we will continue this journey with her as our doctor. Dr. Stein is an accomplished endocrinologist with a lot of experience. He was referred to me by a few friends / acquaintances who had positive views of him and his practice. 
 
When my first round of IVF did not yield a large number of eggs / embryos, his adjustments for and throughout the second round showed far better results.  A third attempt may have been even more promising, but we ultimately chose to move on. 

In Dr. Stein's practice, there is not a lot of focus on preparation before cycles or treatment. There was very little advice on nutritional adjustments or supplements. For me, personally, I was looking for more guidance on how to possibly improve my situation from an integrative medicine perspective before jumping into another cycle. 

That said, as far as western medicine, I would recommend him to those that are focused on that kind of treatment.My doctor was very good about giving me options and helping me weigh the pros and cons of each, allowing me to make my own choices.  She seemed to understand LGBT fertility care and acknowledge that it may look different from other fertility care.I am very grateful for Dr. Copperman. He was the third fertility doctor i had seen. After 
Many failed iuis with previous doctors i met with Dr. Copperman. Upon meeting him for my consultation he knew exactly what treatment plan i needed. I did not get to see him at all visits and that was ok with me. He is a busy doctor but always answered all my questions when i did see him. When i did not end up with any normal embryos the first time he tweaked the protocol and we ended up with normal embryos the second time around. He performed both of my embryo transfers. When my first embryo transfer did not work he reviewed my case with the team and i ended up pregnant with my second embryo transfer. I am forever greatful for him. He always works hard to get you to your baby.We had a very straightforward experience with Dr. Thornton- -  a successful FET.  Overall, she was competent and pragmatic about the whole process, which we appreciated.  She clearly explained and outlined all procedures in a digestible manner.  Furthermore, she was accessible and available to answer our questions.Dr. Flisser is very knowledgeable about his field and he is ready to respond during an office visit. Unfortunately i did not get pregnant and he never really adjusted the protocol after several failed transfers. Also, it was not possible to contact him directly, i always had to go through the nurses which made things very frustrating.He is upbeat, realistic and worked with us to do what we needed. He was compassionate and caring. He is attentive and responsive. He is organized and a clear communicator.  He is upbeat, realistic and worked with us to do what we needed. He was compassionate and caring. He is attentive and responsive. He is organized and a clear communicator.                He is a very smart man, with a lot of experience and knowledge.  Very textbook and he's eager to teach you his knowledge of your situation. So you trust you are getting accurate information but the entire time you do feel like a number. Once we agreed to IVF we saw him once during the process, and we were constantly left with questions and no answers after each visit.Dr. McAvey was warm and compassionate. It put us at ease, but she didn't seem particularly resourceful when we were faced with the results of the initial workup. It turned out we had a combination of DOR and male factor infertility, and she immediately suggested donor eggs, which we weren't ready for. We wanted to try with my own eggs at least once before going down that route. We decided to consult elsewhere for a second opinion, as we weren't sure if Dr. McAvey had the expertise for us. The treatment plan she suggested was either donor eggs or cookie-cutter IVF that didn't seem tailored at all.He's a great doctor. Even during my initial consultation with him, I felt confident in him as my doctor and knew I could trust him. He showed me different statistics, but also talked about how my personal conditions could influence results. He gave me options, talked about what he thought would work for me and advised on how he thought I should proceed. He evaluated our situation and did not push us to do IVF, rather explained it was an option that would significantly decrease the chance of an abnormality resulting in miscarriage. We chose to do IVF and throughout the process he and his staff were hugely supportive. I saw him for all the visits that really mattered. Once when I was struggling with a medication he even followed up with me later that day to make sure I was ok. He's wonderful. Dr. Stein did not take me seriously as a patient from the moment I met him.  When he opened a chart with his assistant, they asked me if I was a lesbian and laughed when I said this is not the case.  I had explained my desire to pursue embryo cryopreservation with my partner's sperm.  Dr. Stein asked me how long I have been with my partner and his age, and proceeded to tell me that it would be a mistake to proceed with embryo cryopreservation.  I felt that it was extremely inappropriate and none of his business.  Dr. Sandler is an expert in the field. He is honest and compassionate and kept me informed every step of the way.  It is a very stressful experience as a patient with difficulties trying to conceive. Dr. Sandler navigates the stress while providing realistic expectations.I found DR Stein to be very available, he explained things well. he managed my expectations but not in a damaging way. he was very kind and warm. he spent the time with me needed during crisis situations Dr. Grunfeld is very patient and easy going, he very knowledgeable is good about answering any questions you have; however, I felt like I had to be in charge. For example I kept on telling him I was staining between cycles he said it's normal, may just be mid-cycle bleeding. It wasn't until I went to the Brooklyn office to do monitoring where I spoke to Dr. Kudesia and she suggested a saline ultrasound sound, she did it and found polyps. She told me I should have a hysteroscopy to remove them. Even after Dr. Grunfeld saw the ultrasound he was convinced my uterus was fine and that it wasn't anything to worry about. I had to push him to do the hysteroscopy , he did in fact find and remove polyps. I also felt he was very pushy towards doing an IVF. I feel like the saline ultrasound should have been done before my 3 unsuccessful IUI s. Dr Knopman is incredibly direct, but also caring and nurturing. She understood my background fully and made sure that we covered all our bases before moving to IVF. She explained everything thoroughly and made sure that I was fully aware of each stage, empowering me to be my own advocate for treatment as well as having her on my side.Dr. Copperman will tell you like it is and is up front and honest.  I really appreciate that.  When we had unexpected bumps on the road, he changed protocol and kept me motivated.  Every time I saw him, he said, don't worry, we're getting there and we're going to make this happen.  His motivation, persistence and aggressive protocol were essential for my success.  When i first met Lawrence Grunfeld he mis diagnosed me. He told me i had alot of follicles while he himself was doing my ultrasound. He anticipated no issues. I then received my AMH results back of .20 and i was confused how i had many follicles in my ultrasound yet such a low AMH. I was at a loss and confused and he was nowhere to be found. When i finally reached him he brushed off this mistake like it was no big deal. Apparently i had not many follicles on my ultrasound which made more sense with my low AMH. I am till this day confused/shocked how a reputable doctor made such a mistake of telling me i had many follicles when in fact i barely had any. Makes me not trust him even if it was an honest mistake. Then we started a cycle and he canceled it because i only had 5 follicles vs 10 or 8. And then i left his clinic. She is extremely smart, a good thinker, and passionate about helping women have and maintain pregnancies.   We went through 2 IUIs, IVF (miscarriage and then a successful FET) with Dr. Knopman and through it all, felt like we were in good hands.  I think Dr. Sandler was a very smart doctor who handled a pretty textbook case of diagnosed infertility very well. I was a VERY nervous patient, and he handled me well, was very honest and practical, and got me to where I needed to be. Sometimes I wanted more compassion, but also understood our goals were aligned, and he was doing everything he could to get me to where I wanted to be,It is hard to be a fertility patient. Especially if you have to keep coming back month after month after month. Dr Flisser always made me feel like I had options and that he would help us achieve our goals. He is kind and nurturing and really makes the effort to personally connect with you. Excellent bedside manner and I trusted him completely. I would never go to any other dr for my fertility. He has a warm bedside manner. Explains all of the pros and cons realistically.   Conscious of my anxiety with procedures and tried to make them as comfortable as they could be. Made time when he could, but had a lot of patients so there was only so much time.Alan was very knowledgeable and always seemed completely committed to getting me pregnant.  he does not show much compassion though and he didn't tell me about pre genetic testing, which I found out from a friend, and found it to be extremely valuable in my final successful IVF.I was sent to RMA by my original gynecologist - who I am no longer with - when I told her I was not ovulating after going of birth control. She said Dr. Knopman saw many young women and would be great for this. Upon meeting Dr. Knopman however I was unimpressed. She was Impatient and had her own agenda. Despite the fact that I was young and had no major medical problems, almost immediately tried to push me to IVF without doing any testing and after having gone only several cycles with her without much monitoring. She wasn't very sensitive about the process and I would definitely not recommend her. 

You get the sense with Knopman and RMA that they have an agenda, and that is to perform IVF. They talked about IVF the first time we ever met with them, when we were simply there because I still wasn't ovulating since going of Birth Control 9 months prior. After cycling with her 3 times on medicated cycles with regular intercourse, Dr. Knopman skipped right over IUI and said we should do IVF. Her reason for this was"" ""Well you want to get pregnant now, don't you?"" When we told her we were uncomfortable with this, she said, fine, i will let you do IUI twice, but then after that, I will only do IVF. That sort of ultimatum was a huge turnoff and we left.Initial impression was good. Over the course of several treatments, failed cycles and two attempts he became more distant. Second pregnancy I was made to feel as though I was more of an inconvenience than a patient. As if I were greedy wanting to try to have a second child. I started fertility treatment with Coppermann be finding his name on this list of top doctors in the New York Times. He does his treatment in cycles of 3 which I liked - therefor I had 3 cycles of clomid, 3 IUI's and 3 IVF's with him.  I would not describe Coppermann as particularly warm with a great bedside manner- he did explain the process and answer all out questions but at times we felt like he was bored by our questions and was too busy to really address our concerns.  I did like how he did reach out personally after each failed cycle.   Dr. Sekhon was very empathetic and has an excellent bedside manner. Throughout the course of my treatment I felt that she listened to my concerns and made appropriate adjustments to treatment plans. I wish that I had more time with her and could see her during all my appointments but it seems the practice is extremely busy.   I believe I got pregnant because of Dr Flisser. He understood the situation and didn't follow normal protocols because our situation wasn't normal and this is why we were successful.  He was very patient when I asked questions and always very kind.We only did a consultation and ended up going somewhere else because we wanted a doctor with stronger bed side manner. However, he did answer all of our endless questions and was very blunt so I knew if I went with him he would not have sugarcoated anything.I am currently pregnant with my 3rd child, thanks to Dr. Stein. To say I am grateful to him is an understatement. But it goes beyond that- the care he and his team (especially nurse Eliza) provide is truly best in class, and their kindness and support is something my husband and I found to be invaluable, during what can at times be a very emotionally taxing process. Dr. Stein balances his incredible experience and expertise with a candid yet compassionate bedside manner. He was always able to make me laugh when I needed it! I truly miss him and his team, now that I have graduated . I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Stein, and this is not only because I have been so fortunate in being successful under his care.Her strengths include her compassion and knowledge. She explains things very well. Her weakness so far is that I have not had a child yet. My treatment continues with her and am looking forward to the outcome. Fantastic. Excellent bedside manner and knowledge as a doctor. We felt fully confident in getting the results we wanted with him from the beginning and reassured all the time being in his care. Now we have a little baby girl!He was amazing! He knows his stuff and will get you pregnant in the best course of action he sees fit.  He is approachable, communicative and understands how anxiety-ridden this entire process can be. He also has a wonderful sense of humor, which makes a big difference. Dr. Lederman is compassionate and empathic. Even something as small as him following up with my husband and I's recent trip to Texas, shows how attentive he is. From day 1, he was optimistic that he'd be able to help us conceive. He reassured us and walked us through the grueling steps of IVF. Luckily, it worked on the first try. I am wholeheartedly grateful for the care I have received with Dr. Lederman and I would recommend him to anyone and everyone. I also love the fact that he performs his own transfers. His nurse, Tatiana, is outstanding. She's very sweet, knowledgeable, and caring. Although, I am happy to be graduating to my Ob, I am also sad to leave RMA. Daniel Stein gets straight to the point when it comes to giving you a diagnosis and courses of treatment and the likelihood in each treatment. Giving you hope but also keeping you grounded with letting you know the risks and the chances of a viable pregnancy.Dr. Stein took the time to explain his reasons behind the protocol he used as it was different from a previous round of egg freezing I'd done at a different clinic. He made me feel optimistic about my chances of a successful outcome and had a great bedside manner. He was available for questions via email and provided thoughtful responses.Dr. Stein is very direct and honest with his patients.  He explains every step of the process and answers all questions patiently with images and diagrams when necessary.  He has given honest feedback when asked and has responded to emails or calls on a timely manner.  My first initial meeting with Dr. Copperman was great. He went through all of my paperwork in a lot of detail. Unfortunately, I have to complete 6 IUI treatments before moving onto IVF, so we are working towards that.Dr Copperman took time to answer my questions and explain changes in my protocol.  He called me directly with results on a few occasions and was comforting when I found out I miscarried. The conversation was driven by my questions most of the time.  Wish there was more guidance on what I didn't know to ask.  Although its hard to know what you don't know.  Did not feel like a number and felt like I received the needed amount of attention at each stage.Eric Flisser was very knowledgeable about my particular issue and took a lot of time to explain it to me and come up with a treatment plan that took into account my age, what I was up against and the number of children I want. When I came in for my consultation I was a little taken aback because he didn’t review all my records. He said he trusted my previous doctor who in the end made big mistakes. However throughout my treatment with him everything went smoothly and he did everything correctly Dr. Flisser was very informative. He was clear about the process and timing of the procedures. 
At one point I spoke to another doctor for.a second opinion and when I went back to Dr. Flisser to discuss additional ideas he was open to changing some of the plans. He explained risks and gave statistics when asked. Dr. Davis was incredibly informative from day 1 when we had our initial consultation. He thoroughly explained every detail of our options and helped us make informed decisions. He was very positive and always happy to see us. When we had our miscarriage Dr. Davis called and made the time to talk through the process and our options. We felt very comfortable with Dr. Davis and trusted that he had always our best interest. Dr. Copperman came across as an expert (which he is, of course!) but was skilled in explaining things in lay-person terms. He was warm and patient, and I left the initial meeting feeling like I was in good hands. He was efficient and I am sure knows what he is doing but is not warm and does not explain details or even the general process well. I barely saw him, the one time I had him for sonogram he was not encouraging and I thought of switching, but since I was in the middle of a cycle I didnt. I am so happy I switched to Dr. Lekovich!!!Dr Stein is a very knowledgeable professional. He is very clear on which direction to take and is ready to guide you during the process. He is honest and direct, he doesn't cover things. 
He could take a bit more time to talk during the treatment process. 
Feel that we have only spoken really taking time on the initial consultation then was very much in and out.I felt very confident with Dr Stein treating me.  He has 20+ years of experience which earns my trust.  He is not going to sugar coat things and make you have higher expectations than you should.   He is a good communicator.  I never had trouble understanding what he was telling me.Dr. Stein is sort of rough around the edges, but he seems to truly care about me and my husband, and about our (hopeful) future pregnancy. He listened to my long list of questions about how to adjust treatment and he explained which ones we could do and which he didn't think were right for us. He was very quick to respond to the one email I sent. Dr. Klein is by all accounts an excellent doctor (and I'm the daughter of a doctor, and I have two Ivy League degrees, so I'm a VERY well informed, picky patient!). His attention to detail and understanding of data/risks and medical care is top notch. In addition, he is incredibly caring and compassionate - a rare blend. He is highly practical, but knows when to be cautious, and is one of the best practitioners in the field. Anyone with fertility challenges is lucky to be his patient, and my 9-week old embryo and I will be sad to leave!He is a straight shooter. If you need delicate messaging, he isn't the doctor for you. I appreciated his candidness and that he didn't inflate my expectations. He was always available to answer questions and personally called with results and information.He was a very kind doctor who explained all of his methods and approaches very clearly, made sure to set me up with key people so that they would explain all expenses and other information, and he even drew a picture of my ovaries and uterus to explain what was going on. Plus generally a chipper and human way of talking.Dr. Sandler made himself accessible for questions and to discuss changes in course of treatment, but did not present option other than injectables.  Also, there was no sense of urgency in how I was treated or real discussion about the effects of time and delay.Dr Flisser was concise with my treatment plan and presented me with a realistic expectations. I had questions along the way which he addressed with patience and understanding.  Overall, I felt very comfortable with him as a patient, and would return to him for my next pregnancy without hesitation. Previously stated what I think are his strengths. Weaknesses: working in a reproductive clinic this large makes personalization of attention and treatment hard. He did not perform all of the IUI, IVF procedures which would have been preferred. Overall we were more satisfied with him than another female doctor that we had. He was great, but due to timing, I rarely saw him. He is warm, and has a good sense of humor and I felt very comfortable with him. He explained things thoroughly and if I ever had questions I could email him. Overall, my experience was good!! I didn't get too many eggs (6 frozen) but he seemed to think that was a good amount for my numbers. He recommended that if money was not a concern that I should do a second round, but it's so expensive and I don't know if I will do it. Dr. Klein was amazing. He was very realistic with us about our chances and was still willing to help us.  He was very responsive on email and in visits.  He gives a frank assessment of your situation and was a welcome relief from doctors who gave us the runaround. aside from initial visit, I have not seen dr kudesia again. i have undergone three cycles of medicated treatment (ovidrel + letrizol) and they have been unsuccessful - she did not follow up ever. furthermore, last treatment resulted in extreme adverse side effects to the ovidrel which I found out AFTER being in NY Downtown Presbyterian Hospital ER, again no call from Dr Kudesia. She increased the ovidrel mg after being notified that I wasn't successful but that increase in dosage likely led to the ER visit. The overall lack of concern for my health and lack of follow up is concerning. He's very knowledgable but seems rushed.  I love Dr. Lederman and his nurse Martha.  The finance staff is terrible and the phone system is frustrating, but Dr. Lederman really gives 100%.Dr Knopman is extremely knowledgeable on the latest discoveries, science and trends in fertility. I got pregnant on my first IVF and I could  tell I was getting better care that was informed by science compared to my friends dealing wit IVF .  Frankly, she is a woman and mother herself and I think that because she ""gets it"" she was able to translate that to my care. I felt like I was in the hands of the savviest, most knowledgeable doctor. And she was NEVER too clinical sounding - she broke it all down for me in ways I could understand. She actually recommended NOT doing some procedures that would have put a lot of money in my pocket. I can't say enough good things about Dr Knopman. Highly recommend.Dr. McAvey was very warm, optimistic, thorough and personal. Dr McAvey was very warm, optimistic, thorough, and personal. I appreciated her bedside manner and her level of involvement in my care. I would definitely recommend. Dr. Sandler is very experienced. Because he sees so many patients for procedures, if you don't talk with him about everything you know and understand, he will start at the beginning to describe your issues. He tries to be realistic, yet hopeful, that you will get pregnant, but will also explain when there are problems. He is kind and compassionate, and really feels invested in our success. My biggest critique is that he is sometimes overly optimistic, and won't entertain 'next steps' or worst case scenarios in a cycle unless or until they happen. He's a cheerleader through the process.She was okay but not very compassionate.  I wanted information eggs I had donated when I was younger and she blew me off and refused to answer my questions. If she legally couldn't she didn't say that.  It was upsetting. I would not recommend her, but I figured egg freezing is straightforward so why not stay with her for that. She has since left the practice so I won't be using her again. that's all.                      He has a calming presence and you feel safe in his care. He was very clear with me about the reality of my condition and the odds of getting pregnant. He is kind and enthusiastic and always available by phone.Dr. Talebian is very reassuring, despite my many setbacks, that eventually I will get pregnant. I was probably okay with going on to my 7th IUI, when she encouraged me to move onto IVF. I believe that she is doing the right thing by helping me move on from treatments that are not working. I appreciate a doctor that is willing to give me a nudge. Dr. Klein was almost malicious to me during a post-surgery complication.  He was not my doctor but due to timing ended up being the person who did my retrieval.  I left the surgery with no pain medication, called that afternoon received no help, and when I called again that night he yelled at me for calling the answering service and bother him (it was only 10pm) and sent me to the ER rather than help me by ordering a simple pain medication.  Even my normal doctor at RMA was horrified.  I honestly don't have a great memory but I felt like I was able to 2 nurses
To be very close with. I also had to push dr. Copperman to do more and go stronger with medication. He was pretty lax and I knew he needed to up my doses. Some of the early treatments I felt were a waste of money. But I overall got a beautiful baby and I really did like Copperman. He was a very non-alarmist. Just bad. Also, see my comments from the human section. He was hard to get a hold of. He was pushy pushy to IVG IV[F] I have to add. He dismissed my symptoms that I later learned pointed to endometriosis. AND later, I was diagnosed with stage 2 endometriosis. The funny (or not so funny) thing is, I read in NY Magazine that he is the expert in endometriosis. He totally unprofessionally told us how terrible another doctor we had met with was.He was great especially on email he would get right back to us. Office is very busy but assume that is the case with all clinics. Dr. McAvey is highly reputable and is incredible at what she does. She does not give false hope, tells it like it is, and is overall an amazing doctor. She’s very compassionate and personable. I have recommended her to many of my friends having issues trying to conceive. Pros: Straight forward, open minded about non-traditional treatments to use as a complement (i.e. acupuncture), it was important for me to know the details of the treatment and why did we have to do IVF and he very willing to educate me and provide explanations even if it required extra time. dr Sandler is very direct, has an incredible human kindness never found in other infertility specialists; some times I did not like what I hear but he kept focusing me in the right direction we even decided to take a six month break that gave us the chance to come back with a successful treatment. he even gave me his cell number to make sure I could call whenever I wantedWas very thorough during my initial consultation & pointed me towards exploring endometriosis (which was a blessing & I am eternally grateful for that conversation as it was the first time it was brought up)  but seems out of touch with me personally & relies on numerous coordinators.Dr. McAvey is very knowledgeable and pretty direct.  She can be pretty rushed so you'll have to either ask her to slow down a bit or repeat herself.  She makes sure to cover all bases to give you the best opportunity.I was very happy with Dr. Stein as my doctor. He was honest and truthful and spoke to me the way I wanted. He was open to my questions and my preferences and didnt sugar coat my chances. He was genuinely happy for me when he was able to graduate me. 
She is very professional, which could be interpreted as being a little bit cold.  She is courteous and explains everything in detail, with technical terms and “common”, more understandable terms.  
I didn’t have to wait too long to see her and she is also available over the phone.I only had a consultation with him. He said I could call or email with any concerns but then when I left and tried to call or email they said to speak to the nurses or coordinators. Im trying to decide if I should move forward with him or Nejat at Generation Next. RMA told me that with insurance it would be $8k. Nejat wont tell me how much it will cost yet. I only saw him for my consultation. Another doctor gave me conflicting information than he did so unsure on trust level thus far but still mid way through treatment but getting another opinion before continuing Dr. Davis was committed to our journey, compassionate, thorough and determined. He was very uplifting during the hard times and always had our best interest in mind. I would choose him for any future procedures.She’s very detailed during the paid visits. However, IVF Cycle for us was more of a disappointment since we didn’t get much of details of what is going on and what to expect next. Retrieved egg count was pretty low compared to the follicles were counted in the last visits. He gave me a hope that we have age on my side I will def get pregnant. But then I didnt get pregnant and then had a chemical.he told me the changes that will happen in a new cycle.he had alot of information Dr. Lawrence Grunfeld was honest and candid about my odds using my own eggs and we tried that route with no success. He didn't seem too eager to adjust the treatment plan for my second attempt with OE but when I insisted he listened and followed suit. He was compassionate when needed and helped me move onto donor eggs when that time came.Dr. Thornton was very knowledgeable and thorough. She is personally kind and compassionate. She can explain these difficult concepts very easily, and without lots of jargon or sounding condescending. He wasn’t a good listener but he’s good at his craft. I trusted he knew what he was doing but it’s a busy clinic so I didn’t feel like I got all the attention I deserved. Luckily I caught a mistake and was able to set back the month of my transfer, ultimately making it a success. It was my doing, not the doctor or office. Dr. Stein was very direct in his course of treatment. He never changed course, unless it was right for my benefit, and he showed compassion throughout the whole process.  He was extremely understanding of my many questions and concerns and went through all procedures in-depth. He is clearly expert but his communication style is to be limited and not really conversational. He does care about getting you a positive result but doesn't really talk to you very often. He will listen but there's not a ton of conversation I had a very positive with Joseph Davis. He was very easy to approach. I felt comfortable asking him my questions. Notably, I have not always felt respected and understood as a queer butch woman in fertility spaces but Joseph made me feel comfortable. He is responsive, kind and excellent at managing the medicine levels for optimal results. He is not always the biggest fan of alternative treatments but he will listen and agree to trying out of the box methods as long as they won't cause harm. He is a great doctor, he made me feel at ease each time I saw him.

He was always willing to answer all my questions and address any concerns I had.

Dr. Flisser is friendly and i am happy i entrusted him and his team with my care.Dr Stein is the best fertility doc in town. He is brilliant, kind, patient, responsive, and has a wonderful bedside manner. I wasn't the most straightforward fertility case, and I truly believe if I had ended up anywhere else, it wouldn't have ended the same happy way. Dr Stein kept me calm through it all. I left RMA when they stopped taking my insurance, tried a different fertility clinic (one of my biggest regrets), and quickly returned happy to pay the out of pocket costs to be under Dr Stein's care. Would recommend highly!Davis has good bedside manner. He's friendly and explains things well. He seems pretty sympathetic to what I'm going through. He doesn't necessarily give me any sense of hope for my case so I never really know what he's thinking but overall, my experience with him as my doc has been positive. He always answers my emails but sometimes doesn’t answer the question directly .. I felt he didn’t take my care very seriously bc I didn’t do ivf .. he was just laid back with my iuis and wanted me to start ivf but without giving enough chances to iuis .. care wasn’t always clear and he didn’t believe in supplementing with progesterone or estrogen .. Dr. Stein was available for ongoing questions at any time. He would answer emails on the weekends and get back to you in timely fashion. I always felt confident with his care and that I was in the best of hands. Dr. Copperman was kind, thoughtful, and insightful.    He explained everything and made sure I was informed about all procedures.   I felt very comfortable under his care.   He even called me while on vacation with his family to make sure I was ok after my transfer.  Davis has good bedside manner. He's friendly and explains things well. He seems pretty sympathetic to what I'm going through. He doesn't necessarily give me any sense of hope for my case so I never really know what he's thinking but overall, my experience with him as my doc has been positive. Dr. Grunfeld was very detailed oriented, had an obvious expertise in this area and explained on a macro level what was going on and what to expect (the nurses handled the day to day). I understood my diagnosis and what the treatment would be. Dr. MacAvey is kind, honest and to the point. She's optimistic and extremely helpful. I highly recommend her and the entire RMA staff.I only saw him twice, once to know him and then at transfer, they prepared my cycle in Mexico (because I liver there) they have this great doctors Martha Luna and Enrique Cervantes they prepare you end then when you are ready yo go tu NYC to do the transfer. The doctors that really treated me and where in contact with me where Martha and Enrique in Mexico.
Sandler was nice and he explained everything very well, even though we had no luck in both our treatments with him (one miscarriage and one negative test with donors eggs), I really really like the structure/administration they have at the clinic, they say they will call at 5 with results and the really do. They work by the book and i like that very much.Very smart, non judgemental and did a great job of achieving the results I wanted from my IVF treatment. 
Great bedside manner
Very communicative
Adjusted treatmebt accordingly and discussed all options clearly.   I met with Dr Sandler after a natural miscarriage, at first he did a sonogram, didn't suspect any issues there, ordered me a HSG and day 3 blood work and said since I am young he's pretty sure there's nothing to worry about. after my day 3 bloodwork he had a nurse tell me that I have diminished ovarian reserve and shes so sorry. i had to wait 3 weeks until he would see me to discuss options. at 28 he basically said my body is a 40+ year old woman and it would be difficult to get me pregnant, but no big deal, i could use donor eggs. No compassion. As i sat there crying he kept saying donor eggs are a great option.He was a perfect doctor.  He spent a lot of time with us from the hours long first meeting to the monitoring visits when he would discuss results, what to expect, and answer all of our questions.  He was thoughtful about treatment options and recommendations.She seemed savvy and progressive, she doesn't have old school of thought. She is leaving her practice and starting her own and I will follow her to new clinic. The whole fertility process feels fairly mechanical especially if your condition is unexplained infertility. But unlike my previous fertility doctor at Cornell Weill, who was clearly going through the motions and very rushed, Dr. Klein was kind, patient and took the time to clearly explain things so I didn't feel like just another one of the thousands of women in New York in her late 30s trying to conceive. After just one round of gonal f injections, careful monitoring and IUI I became pregnant with twins. Dr Klein was extremely aware of avoiding this and unpleasantly surprised but not shocked - to be clear, this was certainly not his or my desired outcome as he measures success by singleton pregnancies. Whether this is an indication of his ability is subjective - I was not pleased but ultimately delivered 2 healthy babies. Just something to be aware of with any fertility measures. He is extremely competent and knowledgable and genuinely wants his patients to have successful cycles, but he can also be flippant about emotional needs. I also felt that any time I complained about side effects from various medications, there was never a strong attempt to alleviate anything. I was just expected to accept that a range of uncomfortable symptoms come with the territory. Dr. Lederman is an amazing Doctor that was there for me throughout this entire process. In the end, I got my precious baby boy, so I owe him the world, and will forever be grateful to him!I owe him 1.5 kids! He was open to experiment but not without good reason, he made excellent choices, he dealt with it when I questioned him, he was dogged about getting a good result. He may not always be warm and fuzzy but he does care and he is a terrific doctor Dr. Sandler was very knowledgeable and kind. In the beginning he explained everything to us almost like a high school health class, making sure we undertood everything. The doctors at RMA work as a team and we liked all of them.He was warm and thorough and realistic while being optimistic. I was fully aware of what i was getting myself into- i was prepared for him to be much more pessimistic, but he made me feel hopeful while also aware of everything at each stage.Extremely understanding and very patient, Truthfully caring. When we failed a cycle we literally felt like it affected Dr g personally. Dr g would always return out calls, he would try to schedule our visits so that we didn't have to ruin our weekends. When we failed our first ivf he allowed us to start our second cycle of ivf in August,  although he doesn't usually do cycles then.I felt he was pretty blunt and realistic about our chances.  He asked questions about what we wanted our family to be and how many children we wanted.  He pushed for IVF early on because we knew we wanted at least 2 kids and didn't want us to waste time on a bunch of clomid or IUI cycles, but was fine with our decision to give it a try anyway.  Amazing doctor. Working with infertility patients takes compassion, patience and understanding on top of skill. I was very happy with him as my doctor. He was caring, honest, sympathetic and overall amazing. He treated me like a person and not a number. I saw him more than I expected after all the stores I had heard about just being a number. And still in my life even after my kids are 14 years old! he was very knowledgeable and thorough with his treatment plan and treatment options for us and was always willing to answer any questions or concerns we had patiently. He was to the point regarding what would give us the best chance of conceiving.Honest and friendly he was easy to reach by email. I had been to previous clinics where they rushed into treatment and overlooked a fibroid that was clearly a problem. On my first scan dr Mukherjee said it had to go.  A few clomid cycles after the surgery I was pregnant!He seemed very competent but I rarely spoke to him. His coordinators told me he assessed me the entire time but it was hard to tell. I had trouble stimulating follicles and felt in the dark. It's a challenging process and I had wished for more one on one attention. one on one, he's fabulous and attentive and when I was alone with him, I did feel like he cared about me, but then I wouldn't see him for week, he never did my retrieval and I didn't get many answers on why my cycles did not work.Accurate, but seemed chilly in his demeanor. Results oriented, but only for ""physical"" issues.Dr. Stein was great at explaining every details along the way. He was extremely supportive. He also knew me by name after the very first appointment, which made the whole experience feel very personal.Dr. Klein was kind, patient, compassionate and understanding. He knew the sensitivity of the whole situation and didn't try to give me other options that would delay the process for no reason. He was always reachable and I cannot thank him enough!She was an incredible doctor. Highly intelligent and direct communicator and very, very thourough. She cared deeply about her patients and was so generous in even helping us by donating the costs of the meds during our second round. I continue to see  her as my OB and have enormous respect for her. She has gotten a number of my friends pregnant too.My experience was long and grueling but I got the outcome I wanted.  They were willing to keep going with me as long as I wanted and were helpful in the process.  It's an awful process to go through but they were professional about it.very trustworthy - took me seriously - respected me as a single mother - not a lot of small talk but that fit my style - in retrospect wish i had not spent so much time and money on iui and gone straight to ivf - he was efficient and caringHe was candid and patient from the very first visit. Gave us realistic assessment. We happened to be very lucky and treatment worked within 8 months of starting it, but he made the process smooth and amazing.He was a very good doctor. I am struggling with male infertility and he helped me understand the issues I was facing. He did everything he could do to provide information to my insurance company in a timely manner. His nurses are extremely helpful too. 


He seems smart and interested in taking action. Very methodical. She had time for me and was available if I had questions.He sat down with us and explained the process.  He exuded confidence which gave us a level of comfort. He was very good at managing our expectations and disclosing as much information as we needed without stressing us out.I'd rather have an effective RE than a nice guy, and that was my choice. Copperman (Dr. Fancy pants) will not win any awards for bedside manner, but the results I got with him exceeded my wildest dreams. He knows what he is doing and gets results.  His bedside manner could be better, but he genuinely believes in what he is doing.  Dr. Mukherjee was always very honest and realistic about my diagnosis.I know of no weaknesses. He was the ideal doctor for me and I would recommend him to anyone for ART, and I have referred friends to him many times. The entire staff is great, but I wouldn't recommend this facility if the male partner is the problemWonderful bedside manner. Very thorough, though, I would have liked a follow up appointment with him after the egg extraction to discuss the quality of the eggs / embryos. Very blunt. Was eager for me to start IVF right away after two miscarriages (naturally conceived). failed to mention that they were genetically normal. Misled us.Amazing doctor with a great bedside manner. Kind and patient, answered all questions. Straightforward but also warm.For our first appointment we met with Dr. Stein to discuss our situation: current test results done by my OBGYN, review additional testing that would be done to determine next steps, and anything else we had on our mind - he clearly answered all questions, comments, etc, no matter how crazy my internet based questions were!

Once all results were back we went back in to meet with Dr. Stein to discuss our options. He clearly went over all options available to us, and provided his recommendation on what he thought would be best. We decided to move forward with IUI per his recommendation as he did not think we needed to start with anything too invasive at first, planning to do three rounds before reassessing our options.

Dr. Stein performed our first IUI procedure, and did so clearly explaining each step, and injecting just the right amount of humor into it all to help us feel more relaxed! 

When our third attempt didn't work, we did one more round of IUI while we waited for our appointment with Dr. Stein to discuss what to do next. 

After our fourth IUI procedure, before it was time to take a pregnancy test, we had our follow up with Dr. Stein to discuss next steps. He went over the entire IVF process. We left that appointment feeling hopeful and excited to get that next process started. We felt that we were in the best hands. I was more relaxed after that meeting than I had been since before we initially met with him to start IUI... perhaps that is what helped lead to a positive pregnancy test with our fourth IUI cycle!

Tomorrow I will be 20 weeks pregnant with our son. We are so thankful to Dr. Stein, Eliza, and the entire team at RMA of NY Westside for their support throughout this process. I would highly recommend them to anyone encountering fertility issues. We definitely plan on going back when we are ready for baby number 2. Dr Stein is the best- I wouldn’t trust anyone else with building our family. I know we can count on him for the most professional and sensible advice and care. We have one child and are expecting our second, and through years now we have successfully put our trust in dr Stein Dr Mukherjee did an excellent job with my care. I do wish I could have seen him a bit more often, but I understand that he has a life and many other patients as well. He was very responsive to email and made sure to call me when there was something serious going on. Dr. Klein is very compassionate and understanding. He is through his job and explains procedures in detail. He is passionate about his field and helping a patient achieve their goal to become pregnant. I had the pleasure of working with him through this journey of infertility. I recommended him to my friends who did achieve pregnancy and now I’m next to try IVF after failed IUIs. 
Dr. Klein you’re a fantastic doctor! Keep up the good work and remaining human with your patients. It goes along way! Thank you.  I would say this, out of  the 6 clinics I have been to, Dr. Flisser has been the most reliable, organized and trustworthy doctor.  He made me feel at ease with my procedure. He is very knowledgeable in his work, his bedside manners were great and his empathy for his patients is amazing. He made sure that when I left to continue  with my obstetrician I was in the right hands. She is very nice and open to any suggestions I had from doing my own research. I am very happy with her as my physician since she really takes an interest in her patients. While not perfect, no one is, I would much prefer having her than some of her colleagues with whom I dealt.He’s very thorough. During the consolation Dr. Sandler goes over the whole reproductive process, your chances of conceiving and the full overview of what to expect. I was just hesitant going to a for profit place. But I’m on to my 3rd doctor and feel that I have to give RMA a fair chance too. The nurses seem to be there to support you along the way. I will say the nurses who draw blood aren’t as good as Columbia but I’m sure I can get over that. I felt that other places were too conservative and didn’t understand my rush even though I’m 36.Dr. Lederman has been very supportive, accessible and clear on the process, outcomes, next steps, and opinions, which I appreciate.   I appreciate that he has personally called me with updates and final IVF results re: my embryos.  He has been flexible in having a call vs. appointments, and comprising on appointment times so I can be easily accommodated.  I feel like he is on my side and I trust him.Dr Stein was amazing he had great bed side manners. He explained everything In detail. He listen to our concerns he answered and explained everything in  step by step. He took his time and we never felt rushed. The treatment was not successful but I do feel like she gave me all the facts. She’s a realist, never emotional. I felt I could trust her and will be continuing on the next phase of my treatment with her. Dr. Flisser is very academic in nature and therefore is able to explain things in a very scientific and clear manner.  I felt during the course of treatment that he didn't always address all of my concerns as quickly as I would have liked.  I usually had to push to add new hormones or try new things after repeated failed IUIs.  Dr. Flisser is a very kind and warm person with a gentle bedside manner.Dr. Stein is very straightforward.  He doesn't sugar-coat anything and will give you straight answers.  I absolutely trusted his medical advice.  He will advocate for you and is open to changing treatment options based on your preference. Smart, but very busy and not sure he wants to dive into my specific issues.  Felt like I got the same treatment as everyone else.  Still no answers on my infertility and when my husband and I had blood work and testing done, it was the nurse who called with the results and often she couldn’t explain the meaning. I was very happy with Dr Ledermanns care. He was kind caring, had great experience, gave me confidence in his recommendations whihch he tailored to my personal cicumstances. He talked quite quickly but always gave me time to ask questions and I did not feel rushed.I first worked with Dr. Copperman for my elective egg freezing cycle while still single.  Only 2 eggs were retrieved and he informed me that he felt the peak of my fertility was likely several years earlier, in my 20s, which I felt was a little harsh at the time (I was 34 at the time of retrieval).  Four years later, now married and with many disappointments on the fertility journey already under my belt, Dr.Copperman was exactly the doctor I needed.  He gave me his expert opinion about my prognosis and best next steps for achieving a live birth (donor eggs).  With his recommendation corroborated by another doctor at a different top NYC facility, we decided to move forward, with Dr. Copperman leading the charge.  I was ready to stop chasing unicorns and wanted the outcome I was looking for, basically, to be a mom and to be able to carry our child.Dr. Stein diagnosed a major obstacle to my getting pregnant -- I had chronic endometritis, which was treated with antibiotics. Our first frozen embryo transfer (with a different RMA doctor) failed but we were successful on the second try, with Dr. Stein in charge. I do wish that they had tested me for endometritis before doing any transfers.
Dr. Sekhon was very informative and easy to talk to. She was very blunt and straight to the point. She made sure to answer all of my questions and never made me feel stupid for asking them. I felt as though I was receiving quality care throughout the entire experience. We ended up doing three rounds of IUI and three rounds of IVF under the care of Dr. Stein. Our third IVF worked, we are now 17 weeks pregnant and we couldn’t be any happier! I'll be honest: this journey was certainly never easy. There were sad and frustrating times but we definitely made the right decision by trusting Dr. Stein and sticking with him and the team at RMA.

Throughout our process, we learned that there are many reasons that your treatments can go wrong; infertility treatment is never an exact science, and Dr. Stein was always candid with us about what he could control and couldn’t control. In our cases, we found out that we had PCOS, endometriosis, chronic endometritis, and a chromosome issue as treatments go. We needed a few attempts to find the best protocol for our particular situation. Given the difficulties of our case, I don’t think we could have gotten our successful results as relatively soon as we did if we had switched doctors midstream.

On a practical note, it was very helpful that monitoring visits (to check blood levels, etc.) take place in the morning. The visits were always efficient and I was never late to work. We also received a follow-up call and instructions promptly on the same day.  Dr. Stein and on-duty nurses/doctors were also quick to answer my emails whenever I had questions or concerns. 

My advice to any couples considering infertility treatment is to take the time necessary to do your own research and ask lots of questions to your doctor. At RMA, our experience was that Dr. Stein would always listen to and answer our questions, even if our concerns or anxieties were more internet-based than evidence-based :-). Make sure you understand the treatment and protocols that are recommended, and why it is that a doctor believes that a given protocol is the best course of action for your individual situation.

Overall we had a very positive experience working with Dr. Daniel Stein and enthusiastically recommend him and the team at RMA. Without Dr. Stein’s counsel, diligence and hard work, we would not be at the incredibly happy place we are today, getting ready to welcome a healthy baby into our family.I had two transfers with Dr Copperman. Both resulted in a pregnancy. My first pregnancy ended in a missed- miscarriage at 17weeks due to uterine fibroids. I of course was devastated, but Dr Cooperman was honest with me and told me that if we were to proceed I would need a myomectomy to remove the fibroids.  So I went ahead with the surgery, healed, and then we transferred the next embryo resulting in my son born October 2019. Dr Copperman was at my every appointment and explained the next steps, risks, etc. He was honest and genuine. I never felt over medicated, or over tested. I plan to go back if I decide to have another baby.  We successfully conceived after 3 IVF cycles at the age of 39. I'm 11 weeks and we are doing great! I appreciated while RMA is a busy practice, I always received very hands on, meticulous care from Dr Stein.  From retrieval, to monitoring, to transfer he was personally there at each step. RMA does not stop after you become pregnant. It was post ""positive pregnancy test"" that I found my most valuable care navigating the delicate weeks after. We definitely attribute the medication protocol and weekly monitoring to our successful ""graduation"" to my OBGYN at 9 weeks. Dr. Stein is knowledgeable and a straight-shooter. I appreciated that he shared his opinion and recommendations on my IVF decisions and personally answered any questions I had in our consults and over email. I highly recommend Dr. Stein if you are looking for clarity and don't need to be coddled. My fertility journey is over, thank goodness, but I find myself missing Dr. Stein's wry sense of humor. I kind of wish he were my OB!Dr. Thornton was amazing, she was very informative but explained everything in a delicate manner. Accommodated me while I was traveling, never let me lose hope, but always kept it real with me. She never made me feel like a patient. She felt more like a friend who was my doctor.We really liked Dr Flisser's approach to patient care.  We didn't need a lot of ""kumbai-ya"" but we felt that he really listened, he explained things in ways that made sense to us and offered practical, results-oriented advice.  I knew going in we'd need to use a donor egg, but my husband wasn't quite there.  Dr. Flisser talked to my husband in a manner that clarified things for him and made him feel comfortable with the path forward.  And throughout the whole process, he answered questions and talked about the process in a way that was reassuring.  We were lucky in that we had a very smooth process to getting pregnant (great egg donor result, all of our embryos had great genetic testing results, we got pregnant from the first transfer) but I feel confident that if that hadn't been the case, Dr. Flisser would have been great in less than ideal circumstances.Dr. Stein has great bedside manner and makes you feel comfortable yet taken care of. Although he may make lighthearted comments these were only when completely appropriate and he never acted unprofessionally. He obviously is a true expert in his field and knows exactly how to handle every situation in the best way possible. It was such a pleasure being Dr. Stein's patient.  I felt like he really understood my unique I initially thought there was no hope in me getting pregnant again.  But at the very last minute Dr. Daniel Stein came out to see me one more time in the waiting room and said let's try something different this time.  That sudden encounter gave me the hope I needed to push through.  And here I am now....writing this review with my daughter snuggly attached to me (via wrap) sleeping.  I would highly recommend Dr. Stein to everybody....even my worse enemy (if I had one).  condition and went above and beyond to help us get pregnant.Dr. Copperman brings all of his experience and expertise to helping you get what you want. Sometimes I had to ask him to be more forthcoming about his opinion, since the tendency can be to let you take charge, but he did this when asked, and ultimately helped me not waste time and get pregnant in less than 6 months! I felt especially attended to during my FET cycle and during the weekly visits with him after my positive pregnancy test. He confidently told me everything looked perfect as we went along. I felt reassured and like I was in great hands. By the end I was so comfortable, that it was hard to leave and switch to an OB.Nothing but positive things to say about RMA, especially Dr. Thornton who is an amazing, smart, and compassionate person and doctor. After a miscarriage 2 years ago and difficulty getting pregnant after that, we made an appointment with RMA and Dr. Thornton. It was a long and winding road that ultimately ended in success. On 6/10/19 I gave birth to a beautiful, healthy, little miracle baby girl. I owe an enormous thank you to RMA and Dr. Thornton.My husband and I are so grateful for Dr Stein. Dr Stein is very experienced and personable. He is always respectful, nice, caring, and happy to answer all my questions (I have many). He is realistic but always shows hope for the best. He was there for the important parts: embryo transferred and pregnancy monitoring. We were glad to have Dr. Flisser as our doctor throughout the process. We were able to see him for almost all monitoring appointments, except for two. He asked how I was feeling each time. He was direct and to-the-point, but also compassionate. We knew these appointments would be very different from OB appointments throughout pregnancy, so they are understandably shorter and more concise, but it was just what we needed to help us through this process.I saw a handful of doctors because whenever I went in for ultrasounds etc. at the Madison Avenue location, I was seen by whoever was there that day. My main doctor was Lucky Sekhon. She was very nice. Dr. Stein was pleasant to work with and I felt provided the best protocol of treatment specific to my needs.   He adjusted my medications as needed and  After two separate embryo transfers, I now have a healthy son.DR Lederman was fantastic for my wife and I. He knew what our best course of action was and made sure we followed everything to perfection. He is a straight shooter and very passionate as to PGT M testing. We had a great experience and trust this team wholeheartedly. The RMA westside is extremely professional and efficient. Our results were great  and that was due to this team pushing us while practicing great overall care (lab techs etc ). We went through three rounds of IUI and one round of IVF with Dr. Stein this year.  We are now pregnant and just discharged today!  Very happy customers.  His team and the faculty at RMANY is professional, punctual, always smiling, and easy to reach.  This place is busy, especially east side - but don't mistake it for a haphazard baby factory.  They truly are the #1 place for fertility issues and I trusted them implicitly.  We highly recommend Dr. Stein and RMANY!!!Dr. Stein is phenomenal. He is an expert in his field with well over a decade of experience, and it shows. He is knowledgeable, precise, and takes the time to answer all your questions, but he is also affable and puts you at ease. A true professional. My wife got pregnant twice thanks to him and we recommend him to anyone we know having fertility challenges.  Dr Lederman is an excellent dr- he was thoughtful, caring, and communicated very well. He always answered all my questions and concerns and made sure that the visits were as convenient as possible for me. I loved Dr Sekhon.  Egg freezing is such a big risk emotionally and financially, and she treated me with care, compassion and understanding.  I am recommending her and the egg freezing process to everyone.It was painless, did not take much time daily, and offers extreme peace of mind. 

The only things I would have liked more detail on upfront were
-do not plan to travel during the injection process since you'll need to get checked on weekends too
-no exercise or sex 2 weeks after retrievalDr. Sekhon is absolutely amazing, I would recommend her to anyone who had to go through this process.

You can tell from her bedside manner, alone, that she genuinely cares and is supportive of ensuring that you receive the best results possible.

She also is extremely responsive on email, which I really appreciated since I had a lot of questions!

She is also just such a nice person and makes you feel very cared for. She made this process a great experience for me and if I have to do it again I will only use her!I am so grateful that I found Dr. Lederman and his staff at RMA. He made me feel so comfortable throughout this whole process. His calm deamear is reassuring and puts you at ease.  He is always pleasant and is always smiling. Dr. Lederman is compassionate, informative and truly cares.  I am now 9 weeks pregnant and graduating to my OB, and while I am happy it is hard to leave because everyone is so great!  I would highly recommend Dr. Lederman.I had been struggling with a recent LEEP, PCOS, hypothyroidism and it seemed like the entire process of trying to get pregnant was filled with nothing but hurdles.  Luckily, I was referred to RMA of New York and I am extremely grateful to Dr Stein and the RMA nurses and staff for their care and support on this journey.  I am now 25 weeks pregnant with a baby girl due July 2020.  

Dr Stein made me feel at ease during our very first meeting and was very patient and supportive, answering all of my questions and reassuring me that they can provide the help that I need.  Once I got my thyroid levels under control, I was put on letrozole and got a shot of Ovidrel, and it worked!  I did not go through IUI or IVF.
Great doctor! I felt like I was in excellent hands the entire time. During consultation she gave me a thorough understanding of the process and risks, she was kind and compassionate, and she was available (and responsive) by email during my entire experience. I have already recommended her to 3 friends. Dr. Flisser is always very kind, warm and direct in his treatment. He has a sweet bedside manner and will always take the time to explain any details to you so that you fully understand treatment procedures and expectations. Dr. Flisser was a great fit for us - giving us as much information as we wanted while also being compassionate. He also adjusted our protocol when we had an unsuccessful cycle (16 eggs but no PGS normal embryos). Dr. McAvy has great bed side manner. She was in contact with me and so were the nurses.  I was never rushed off the phone and all l questions were answered. The clinic as a whole felt like they are just a money making machine and don’t care about patient results.  I only saw Dr Grunfeld during the initial consultation on how I wanted to proceed with my frozen eggs.  He seemed somewhat indifferent during the discussion.  That said, my bigger problems were with the clinic, which made numerous mistakes during the process...but should go back to better doctor oversight (eg, forgot about prescribing and telling my husband to take antibiotics before giving his sample - luckily we have been through this enough at other clinics that we knew to ask)Dr Lederman took the time to answer all our questions, was friendly and compassionate I would say it was in between.  He was very caring and seemed empathetic to such as sensitive manner, he even rubbed my shoulders a few times and said ""you will get there, it just takes time."" I also appreciated how we had access to his e-mail and he would return my phone call in a timely manner. However, although I appreciated the fast past during morning monitoring hours, because I understood everyone needed to get to work, I did feel rushed at times.  I liked how the doctors performed the ultrasounds instead of techs. but, I felt if I had extra questions that day, they didn't really want to be bothered. Dr. Flisser was exactly the type of doctor that we tend to gravitate towards. He's very direct and thorough, always erring on the side of reality and odds rather than providing a false hope or narrative. I think this can often times be interpreted as having a cold bed-side manner because he's often very direct about statistics, chances of success, etc. Rather than sugar coat things he simply conveys what they know about fertility, what the data suggests, etc. However, while his approach can sometimes be a bit more clinical in nature, he's extremely patient, understanding and thorough. We started so many sentences with ""this may be a dumb question, but..."" and every time he would say it's not a dumb question at all and proceed to calmly walk us through everything. This Madison Ave location of RMA is very busy, but we never felt rushed or like he was trying to finish our appointment so he could work with the next couple. As time went on, we developed a great rapport with Dr. Flisser and were truly thankful he was our doctor.Communication with the office was very convenient. I was assigned a coordinator who helped implement the doctor's treatment plan and was easily available by email (and phone if  I needed it). Plus, I got to see my doctor every time I was there and she knew us and our case well. I never felt 'lost' in their system. Dr. McAvey was very down to earth, explained things well and even responded to emails, which was really reassuring. She's smart, talented and well-connected. She referred me to a great doctor for my fibroid surgery.I went to Dr Stein as a single mother by choice, with no history of fertility issues, and he created a plan for me that did not push for more treatment than necessary. He also explained his approach, and was available by phone and email. When I was pregnant, he had me schedule ultrasound appointments on his monitoring days so he could monitor my progress personally. His nurse, Eliza, was also very helpful, responding to emails and calls the same day. Dr. Grunfeld is excellent at giving information and explaining your situation.  We saw him for a second opinion and just looking through my chart from another clinic, he gave me lots of information the original doctor had not, even though it was the other doctor's chart.  He also gave me more information following a physical exam.  He explains things well and answers questions well.  When we got bad news during one cycle, he was immediately available and followed up quickly and thorouthly.  I also felt his information was realistic.   Dr. McAvey was always warm, caring, compassionate and professional. She always took the time to explain everything and answer any questions. I never felt rushed.Dr. McAvey was very sympathetic and listened to our concerns. She was the first doctor we saw with our suspected infertility, and I appreciated being treated like a human when we were apprehensive and unsure what the future holds.Dr. Stein was caring and informative. He or a member of his staff was always available to answer questions in a timely manner.I came from a previous clinic where I was treated as a number. Here I felt more like a human. A doctor saw me at all times. Billing was so helpful always trying to help me find a way to cover costs. I felt like I was cared for Dr. Klein is by all accounts an excellent doctor (and I'm the daughter of a doctor, and I have two Ivy League degrees, so I'm a VERY well informed, picky patient!). His attention to detail and understanding of data/risks and medical care is top notch. In addition, he is incredibly caring and compassionate - a rare blend. He is highly practical, but knows when to be cautious, and is one of the best practitioners in the field. Anyone with fertility challenges is lucky to be his patient, and my 9-week old embryo and I will be sad to leave!Dr Flisser has an excellent bedside manner. He was attentive and was knowledgeable of current research in his specialty. I was an egg donor when I was younger at RMA and I asked for information about this and she was dismissive. I felt this doctor was terrible. I was describing to him abdominal pain, bloating etc. all of these symptoms of endometriosis ( I didn't know at the time that's what it was) and he was like - sometimes people don't feel well. So he didn't listen to me. He just followed his ""in the box"" numbers. I did a couple IUIS there and it just felt like a total factory. My first FSH level was 28.5. I asked him 
about reproductive immunology and he made me feel very silly for asking.I felt they cared about meHe always responds to emails and concerns promptly and with direct information.Genuinely nice guy and really seemed to take control of my treatment to get my desired resultsShe was very responsive over email if I had questions after hours. Better than calling the main number and leaving a message. She was relatable. he explained every procedure thoroughly and the pros and cons of the various treatment options.Dr. Mukherjee is warm, has a good bedside manner and explains things thoroughly but easy to understand.Treatment didn’t feel specific to my situation.  Dr. Stein was sympathetic throughout the course of treatments.I highly recommend Dr Stein.  I appreciated while RMA is a busy practice, I always received very hands on, meticulous care from Dr Stein.  From retrieval, to monitoring, to transfer he was personally there at each step. RMA does not stop after you become pregnant. It was post ""positive pregnancy test"" that I found my most valuable care navigating the delicate weeks after. We definitely attribute the medication protocol and weekly monitoring to our successful ""graduation"" to my OBGYN at 9 weeks. Dr was thoughtful and caring 
Dr. Sekhon is the most patient, considerate and caring doctor I have ever been a patient of. She is extremely detailed and thorough, and goes out of her way to make sure that her patients understand every step of the process. She is truly remarkable and made my experience enjoyable and easy to understand!Dr. Sekhon made an effort to get to know me. Every time I saw her, she checked in to see how I was doing and asked me questions about my life (outside of questions related to the medical treatment).Dr. Copperman made me feel like I was the only patient under his care. He was thorough and took the time to explain everything to me in great detail. He spent an hour with me at my consultation answering my questions and reassuring me. He was real and down to earth. He was the best part of my monitoring appointments. He was kind, gentle and mindful of any previous concerns we had discussed. I told him that I had white coat syndrome and he never wore his white coat at any of my appointments following that statement. He was always thorough and never rushed. He is very genuine, caring and compassionate. I enjoyed how quickly the RMA team dealt with patients, however, sometimes I felt like my doctor didn't even remember who I was. I asked things as follow up to questions from the previous weekly visit and he had no idea that he had seen me before. It wasn't ideal, but it also didn't bother me much. I understand he has lots of patients and my main concern was the end goal, which worked out in just two cycles of the treatment.Dr. Stein is very direct and to the point. I wouldn't ever describe him as warm, but he listened to my concerns and answered all my questions, spoke with me on the phone when I asked for a call, and has been quick responding to my emails (I am undergoing a second round with him this spring). He'll tell it like it is without sugarcoating, but honestly that's the type of person I want in charge of my care.I had serious concerns about how other people at the clinic treated me. He was always very responsive and thoughtful Dr. Lekovich listens and shares information. She seems really invested especially once IVF cycles are taking place. Dr. Lekovich and everyone who works at RMA is extremely kind and warm.   She explained things in detail every single time and I never felt that she was rushing me out the door for her next patient.I believe that RMA and Dr. Flisser treated me like a human being not a number. He and his team took time to answer my questions and they responded to all my queries quickly. He also listens to our concerns My partner and I are both genetic carriers for hearing loss, which we found out while getting treatment for infertility.  Dr. Stein made the decision for us to do IVF before we fully made the decision for ourselves, and that felt a bit forced/rushed.  In hindsight IVF is probably the best treatment for us, but we wanted to make the decisions not our doctor.  Dr. Stein is willing to explain and talk about options, but he makes his opinion known as well. Which can be good for people who need more guidance, but can come off a bit strong fro others.Dr. Lekovich has always been willing to answer all of our questions with honesty and clarity that makes us feel confident in the care she gives us.  She offers reading materials to further our own understandings, while also uses a lot of her own knowledge to explain and explore the choices she makes in each cycle.Dr. Klein treated me kindly and respectfully.  When all our embryos arrested on the day 3 in my first IVF cycle, he called me and walked me through the loss and the started working on the ways forward. At every morning monitoring appointment, and beyond, he had great bedside mannerDr Klein was sympathetic, caring, took his time explaining things, positive and optimistic about the entire process. I never felt rushed or like I was another number on his schedule. He made me feel confident in the process and was just very sweet overall. I trusted him with the process as well. He showed compassion when I had a miscarriage (without doing IVF as it just happened naturally without doing an IVF cycle).Dr. Sekhon is incredibly kind and caring. She's able to deliver hard news thoughtfully and explain why and how certain things are happening in a clear way. Dr. Sekhon treated my husband and me as if we were her friends or family -- when we got bad news, she called us right away and when we got good news, she was cheering in our corner. It's a bit of both. At RMA they see a lot of people and it might feel like you are treated as a number but they are good at what they do. Dr Lederman and all the other doctors spend a couple of minutes outside the examination room reviewing your case before they see you. But Dr. Lederman always remembered our case and asked specific questions that let us know that he remembers the patient.Dr. Sandler monitoring visits were always very quick and i felt he treated me as an ignorant patient who was asking silly questions. He performed none of my retrieval or transfers as there have always been other (much nicer) doctors from RMA on duty when I was scheduled to retrieve/transfer. This was good for me, but I never appreciated having to stick to dr. Sandler for the monitoring part as he was definitely careless about the time patients were waiting in the waiting area. I had a 9 week miscarriage and booked a follow up appointment with him 4 weeks later at 10am to discuss the issue and way forward. Despite being the only person waiting in the waiting room and having an appointment, I was called in at 11am. Basically a full morning lost (I have a 9-5 job) with no apology whatsoever from his side, and a statement that my embryo didn't look good in the first place so there was no hope for it to survive (which was never mentioned to me before).Dr. Stein’s team is very personable, gives you same-day phone calls with updates after bloodwork and appointments, and are in constant contact. From the first consultation throughout the entire 2 egg freezing cycles I did, Dr. Flisser was extremely professional, took the time to thoroughly answer any questions I had, and he had a very warm bedside manner.Dr. Thornton rarely made herself available to speak with me regarding medication questions and concerns I had. I found her to be detached, inconsiderate, and lacking in empathyDr Flisser was very responsive during all of my treatment cycles. Always available to answer any questions and very prompt as well. He gives you a realistic idea of what to expect during the process and was also available to answer questions even after I had transferred care to my OB at 8 weeks gestation. Very caring and knowledgeable Dr. Thornton personally called me many times and I know she truly cared about my outcome.  That said, RMA is a huge clinic so she only had so much time to dedicate to an individual patient. From the moment I walked into the office, it was totally different than what I had dealt with prior. Even if there is a wait you feel relaxed and calm. When you are speaking with the Doctor or the staff, you are given the attention and time you deserve. The offices of RMA are quite busy, as they take a number of insurance plans.  While the monitoring feels busy, we feel taken care of, all questions answered, and a thorough approach to our care takes place when we are one on one with all doctors, nurses, as well as other office staff. Dr. Lekovich has called us to explain the outcome of both of our retrievals, and has taken the time to elaborate on changes to future cycles, and any changes I can personally make in future retrievals.When we spoke to Dr. Sekhon, she was warm and informative and great. But we rarely spoke to her unless we emailed to reach out proactively.From the first consultation to our last visit with Dr. Flisser, my husband and I were treated like humans with feelings, hopes, and desires. Dr. Flisser immediately made us feel at ease, hopeful, and excited about our fertility prospects.  He took the time to learn about us as individuals, beyond the minimum information he needed to know to proceed with our treatment. Every time he walked into the examination room I felt cared for and felt that he was truly invested in getting the best outcome for me—not just to improve his numbers, but because he seemed to actually care. I NEVER felt as if I were just a number or part of some fertility factory when in Dr. Flisser’s care (or when interacting with anyone at RMA).Dr. Thornton is warm and polite. However, the whole process is a one-way approach. She applies the same treatments and has never adjusted them based on the test results or previous failure cycle. She is not interested in increasing my odds but sales the treatment cycle one after another. Dr. Copperman and his team of nurses were always available to me via email or phone. I never felt badly reaching out with extra questions and I always feel like they really care and are ""in it"" with me. Due to false positive on a genetic test by our OB-GYN, by the time we found our way to RMA, we had already seen a host of other specialists including another big name fertility clinic. We were worried not only about our reproductive capacity but also my wife's future health. Only Dr. Copperman and the RMA Genetics Counselor Teresa Cacchione had the presence of mind to look at my wife in person (rather than just on paper) and say let's 'This doesn't make sense. Let's order a retest.' It took only a few days to rule out the impossibly rare combination of disorders previous doctors had assume my wife had from one botched test. From there, we engaged in routine IVF therapy, during which time we always felt like every doctor, nurse, counselor and administrator genuinely cared for us.  At RMA, expect to feel like a one of thousands of patients that are pushed through the system.  You won't be allowed to speak to someone when you call.  You won't actually see your doctor when you have an appointment.  When you do manage to see your doctor, they will not follow through on what they said in previous appointments.  If you have thoughts on your treatment, they won't listen.Dr. Sekhon treated me on a very ‘need to know’ basis. I felt often I didn’t have all the information and that she didn’t take into account the emotional toll of fertility treatments and the overwhelming waterfall of decision making that comes with if.It is a very efficient office that processes a lot more women you'd think need help - that has todo with personal expectations and it may be an indicator of RMA's success, but it does contribute to everything (calls, procedures, visits) being part of a schedule and always hurried.  RMA is a super organized clinic that has very clear processes in place to meet all patients’ needs. However they see huge volume of patients. What that actually means is you get your needs met but it is not by the same team, you see a different doctor each time, and sometimes this results in what feels like less personal care. At times, it was difficult to get a straight answer from the clinic. It is a well-oiled machine. Yet sometimes, you feel rushed during appointments (monitoring or consultations), phone calls, or other interactions. There was one week I had to call every day to get a call back regarding the IVF plan and ordering appropriate medications. Medications were ordered last minute before a trip and I nearly missed a cycle due to the poor response. I never got an apology for their carelessness/disorganization/lack of responsiveness.Dr. McAvey has had great bedside manners, has taken the time to discuss next steps with me and go into detail answering the questions that I've had.Dr. Mukherjee is extremely client-oriented, pays attention to the individual patient and kindly explains the reasoning for suggested treatment. Provides options, discussed details and really wants to have his patient on board, feeling comfortable with the treatment decision.Dr Sekhon really takes the time to talk to you and work with you on your treatments. She always responds to emails or calls in a super timely manner. She never makes you feel silly for asking questions and always respects when you advocate for yourself. She just really gets it and understands its not just the infertility that needs to be treated, its also the anxiety that goes along with it. She works really hard to set your mind at ease. She doesn't sugarcoat, but she is also not cold and matter of fact like many RE's are. Dr. Mukherjee conducted one out of 5 IUIs. I mostly speak with whichever nurse gets my message, although I have been assigned one. I have spoken with Dr. Mukherjee once every 6 months or so. I am confident that RMA is a top-notch facility and Dr. Grunfeld is a great doctor.
My questions were always answered and everyone, the nurses, staff and doctors all work together smoothly. I felt in good hands. I just felt like the process of what happens post egg retrieval was not discussed at all. I had two embryos reach blastocyst and they discarded them based on their quality. I feel like a frozen transfer with PGS testing should not be a one size fits all approach and Dr. Grunfeld doesn't believe in any other way.I saw Dr stein once during my most recent cycle. Once. Things were clearly not going great but I never got analysis or felt like a pivot was being made. I felt like Dr. Grunfeld tailored my treatment protocol to me and my unique chemistry/makeup. He was on top of my cycle and was willing to make tweaks mid-cycle increase my successDr. Klein was very open and kind. He gave us his email address on the day of our consultation and told us to contact him anytime with questions.I saw Dr. Stein for a long time.  He has a lot of patients.  I needed to explain my backstory to him each time and felt he never knew or remembered who I was even after many IUIs and a couple IVF cycles. Dr Klein is efficient and thorough while discussing fertility, procedures, and next steps. He checks off all of the questions I want to ask, demonstrating an understanding of what his patients worry about and what information is valuable. Well-Oiled in the best way, and very bright. When i met with the Dr. she was kind and knowledgeable. During the consultation she has moments where she looked down and did not make eye contact, looked like she was trying to formulate her thoughts and was kind of distracted. So it was hard to see where she was going with non verbal body language. I thought she was checked out from our visit and wanted the visit to somewhat end earlier than expected. I was happy with the answers which she provided us, i just felt that eye contact would have made me feel more confident in her answer and knowing that took this visit just as seriously as we did.Dr. Copperman was extremely warm and compassionate. I felt that he was interested in my well-being as much as he was interested in solving my ""case"". He never made me feel rushed. I was very comfortable speaking with him. The only reason I switched doctors was for insurance purposes, and I actually went back to consult with him a year later. He was wonderful and offered all the help he could.Direct but honest and caringDr. Lederman was very personable and caring during my IVF treatment. He was always available to talk and emailed me back promptly with any questions or concerns that I had. He was extremely supportive of my infertility case and due to being a genetic carrier and undergoing PGD/PGS embryo testing, he was very positive that we would achieve a favorable outcome!Dr Klein was very personable and easy to talk to. He provided me with his email and direct phone number and was quick to respond with any questions I had. He squeezed me in for both cycles before I had to go to work in the morning.I was given percentages of our chances for IUI and IVF sadly all failed - this made me feel like a number. During my care under Dr. Mukherjee, he is blunt with me and my husband; the direct to the point as to what why our IVF failed. He called us for a follow up after the failed IVF which is the way it is supposed to be. I find it as a ""closure"" to a failed cycle. He took the time to explained us what happened and what is the next step. I was supposedly under the care of Dr. McAvey for 2 cycles but only actually saw her twice after the consultation. Didn't feel like I had a personalized treatment plan. She also left a voicemail to tell me all my eggs were abnormal.Dr. Grunfeld barely spoke to me.  In 2013, I froze 24 eggs through one cycle of egg freezing with Dr. Grunfeld.  The doctor was pleased with the result and informed me that there was no need to do another freezing cycle.  In 2018, my husband and I sought to use the eggs after experiencing two first trimester miscarriages. The egg thawing and fertilization process was largely unsuccessful with only 1 embryo surviving to the 5-day blastocyst stage. That embryo was deemed abnormal through PGS testing.  An RMA nurse called me with the results. I was shocked.  The nurse was rushed and said that we lost a lot of eggs in the thawing process and the fertilization process, and that we also lost more than normal during the stage of growing embryos to the 5-day blastocyst stage.  She offered no explanation why our results were so bad.   My husband and I were so upset that we called the clinic three times to arrange for a conversation with Dr. Grunfeld. When we finally spoke to him, the doctor was flip.  He said that my eggs (and our resulting embryos) did not do as well as planned, but that these results were statistically possibly and essentially no big deal. Dr. Grunfeld then suggested we simply do another IVF cycle--as if it were no big deal financially, physically, or emotionally.  I was disappointed, particularly because Dr. Grunfeld had been so optimistic that securing 24 eggs through a freezing cycle would yield good results. Dr. Grunfeld spoke to me and my husband for only around five minutes.  The casualness of his reaction to the fact that my husband and I had two miscarriages (conceived without IVF) and a failure egg freezing/fertilization cycle shocked us.  We indicated that we would seek another opinion before determining how to proceed.  Neither Dr. Gurnfeld nor his office ever called us back to ask what we wanted to do. The entire interaction with Dr. Grunfeld and RMA left us feeling that the doctor and clinic as a whole only cared about our money--not about delivering health care that would help us conceive.The interactions with the office were handled by distinct functional role - dr, nurse, front desk, billing, finance / insurance - yet they all seemed to be playing a cruel and unprofessional game of broken telephone with one another - especially the billing/finance/insurance team. The dr. would schedule a saline sonogram, and the finance person would reach out to confirm that I was coming in for IVF (no!!). The dr. would invite me for the next round of diagnostics (with no concluded diagnosis yet), and the billing person would send me paperwork to file claims of ""Infertility"" with my insurance company. It created a real sense of unease, and I ultimately stopped seeing this clinic as a result.A good friend referred me to Dr. Grunfeld after she successfully became pregnant after IUI.  We only met him twice for consultations- meetings were rushed, he constantly interrupted our questions and concerns, made me feel very uneasy about the process because we were not listened to.  I felt as if he has a one-size-fits-all approach, and he wasn't even there for my IUIs- other doctors always performed them.  There was no communication or interaction with him outside of brief consultations.  His nurses were also clearly dealing with dozens of patients constantly- they had no idea who I was ever, and sometimes this lack of personal connection led them to making some well-meaning but insensitive comments during appointments.  I had a much better, more personal experience at RMA Brooklyn, where I have switched to after our 3 IUIs failed.  We are now with Dr. Lekovich and about to start IVF... She took her time in consult to listen and answer all of our questions and we feel much more secure in her hands.  RMA Eastside has a faceless factory atmosphere, you must advocate for yourself constantly, make sure they are billing you correctly (they once gave me a bill for another patient whose name was similar) and always remember that you are a customer at the end of the day- we were initially denied when we asked to transfer to another doctor in the practice, but when I made it clear I was considering treatment elsewhere, I was immediately given what I asked for.  Keep your guard up and be ready to go to battle for yourself at RMA Eastside and with Dr. Grunfeld.We first went to see Dr. Lederman not knowing we had any issues and just because we had been trying to conceive for 7+ months and were getting impatient. 
We went there just to get more info, not thinking we even had any infertility problems or so.
He was very approachable and very welcoming. He asked us to do a few tests to ensure everything was good and he was very knowledgable given us tons of advice. Dr. Davis clearly explains all of our treatment options and makes time to answer all of our questions. He is kind and approachable and seems to truly care about about the outcome of our treatment.While the clinic is definitely a 'by the number' clinic - Dr. Lekovich herself was warm, interested, and responsive. I felt like a number because she was very candid, optimistic, and seemed generally interested in helping my husband and I concieve. She informed us of all our options. When it came to cost she was very blunt even though it was painful to hear. We were hoping we wouldn’t need to get our embryos screened, but when she learned we both had the sickle cell trait she ended up giving us a math lesson. She was very open and forthcoming about everything.Most of my contact had been with the nurses, who are amazing. Most of them very knowledgeable and patient. Take the time to answer my questions and call the same day. My contact with Dr. Stein has been much less. I expected to be  more in direct contact with him throughout the process, however, the option of scheduling phone or in person appt is always open. Dr. Sandler met with me ahead of the IVF and he had reviewed my file. During the cycle, I never saw him nor spoke to him. After a failed IVF, I had to make an appointment and waited two weeks to see him. There was little communication.I expected to see a different doctor every time I went to the office based on the review that I saw. I did see a few others, but Dr Copperman did my IUI, and saw me for 1-2 monitoring appointments as well as my last visit during which I was discharged. The nurses and staff are so friendly - Leyla and Jordyn (his nurses) are always available over email - they are friendly, informative and their responses are personalized.Dr. Lederman made me feel like a person and less like a number, considering the amount of patients he sees. He has excellent beside manner and answered all of my questions to ensure I understood my options, the treatment and the process.Always addressed by name. Always saw a doctor during my visits. Emails and phone calls addressed rapidly.RMA is a factory, simply put. This isn’t entirely bad, as they seem to know what they are doing (for the most part) - but you will not be treated as an individual really in any way.Dr. Stein was always honest about what to expect. This was helpful especially during the times when things did not go as I wanted them to go. I also really appreciated the fact that I could email Dr. Stein at any point with any question and he would answer promptly. I was a worrier throughout the process and he definitely eased my mind on multiple occasions. This is not an easy process for anyone but I always felt that I was in good hands and that Dr. Stein knew exactly how to achieve the best possible result given my situation. Dr Flisser is a very kind, very warm man who really cared when speaking to us and always took as much time as was necessary to explain his thoughts on our treatment and why we were doing what we were doing. RMA is very effecient and is able to see alot of patients at same time. Some of the nurses that you get to know are quite generous and warm and then you feel like a human. However, you rarely speak with your doctor unless you catch him during monitoring hours - so that makes you feel like a number. I feel doctor Davis cares deeply about my case, but he is not the type of doctor to get extremely personal or send follow up texts after a failed cycle. He is very straight forward and matter of fact. For me it works, because it gives me great confidence in him. He has a warm personality and has never made a consultation feel rushed. Dr. Lekovich was friendly and answered questions that I had regarding my care . Dr. Kudesia was friendly and answered questions related to my procedure . However , our sessions did feel rushed.Dr. Flisser always makes me feel like I have his full attention both when I’m in his office talking or while undergoing treatment. Although the office is hectic and the office staff are often difficult to reach, Dr. Flisser always returns phone calls and provides his full attention. He is compassionate and informative, always making sure that my husband and I have full understanding of all of our treatment options before leaving his office. Although I have not yet gotten my positive test, I am confident that Dr. Flisser will get us there.Even with the sheer number of patients that came into the clinic, Dr Mukherjee and his staff each called to check up on me after my miscarriage. They were always hopeful and positive that they would get and keep us pregnant and told us that repeatedly. If I had questions or concerns I always got a call back. They took every concern seriously and always explained procedures, drugs, etc.During my IVF cycle, Dr. Thornton saw me every time I went in for bloodwork/ultrasounds. She answered all my questions and never made me feel like I holding her up or that she was annoyed when I had a million and one questions. As the IUIs continued, there was no explanation as to why they were not working. And we also did not adjust any “treatment” plans. No added tests, adding progesterone, etc. 
on my 4th IUI, I went into the city and as the nurse shut the door, she said, “IUI in room 5”. Felt like I was at a fast food restaurant Dr. McAvey is kind, optimistic, and has a great bedside manner. Even when I am feeling down about the process, she is encouraging and hopeful. She has been willing to answer all of my questions both by email and phone. At RMA, it's easy to feel like a number, because there are so many women being treated there every day. Even when I felt like ""just a number"" on my monitoring days, Dr. McAvey never made me feel that way during any of our interactions.  I had seen a doctor before who I really didn't like her bedside manner for a variety of reasons so I went to de lederman instead. I feel so much better in his hands ! I can contact him via email all the time with questions , he is warm and understanding and gives his honest and professional opinion . He made me feel like I mattered and I'm not just a number walking into the office Dr. Mukherjee at RMA was recommended by a friend, who hasn't had a successful fertility experience, but I trusted her recommendation. He was always kind and took time to email respond, sometimes quickly, sometimes after some days. When I did see him for consultation or ultrasounds though, I found that sometimes I didn't ask all my questions because he seemed very busy and rushed. He did call me personally though, when to tell me about my one frozen embryo not making it past Day 3 or Day 4, even after the nurse had called me to convey the bad news. I did an egg freezing cycle with him in July of 2019 (out of 4 follicles, only 1 egg was viable and was frozen) and then I tried an embryo freezing cycle again in February 2020, and this time, there were 5 follicles but again, only 1 egg was viable and was successfully fertilized by my partner's sperm, but didn't make it to Day 5. It was heartbreaking to then end up with nothing after spending $17,000 or so when all was said and done. At our last consultation, Dr. Mukherjee said our best chance was to try naturally as I had a low reserve and rather than spend tens of thousands of dollars, that was our best bet, but my partner and I decided to change to a different doctor at Weill-Cornell recommended by a different friend, who had a successful IVF cycle with him. 

So in summary, Dr. Mukherjee was pretty much kind, but we just felt rushed each time we saw him and then at our last consultation to discuss the failed embryo, he seemed to be pessimistic about future fertility treatments and didn't really seem to hear us that we were thinking of a second child. Also, the only thing that changed about our protocol between the first egg freezing and the 2nd time which was embryo freezing, was that he added Clomid and Ganirelix to my protocol. I took all the Clomid prescribed (5 days) and 1 day of Ganirelix, but the result of 1 egg harvested was the same. Dr. Copperman and his whole team were really thoughtful and kind throughout the process. They were always available to answer questions or provide support over the phone, email or in person at the office. When I was feeling emotional during the process to getting pregnant, they were honest and caring. I was excited to send them newborn pictures when our baby was born and look forward to working with them again on baby #2. Dr. Flisser is so warm. He made me feel important and had a great bedside manner. He was completely understanding of my situation and helped me understand my issue. He also took a lot of time with me during my visits and allowed me to ask as many questions as I could. He also took time to explain the process and his staff was very nice and accommodating too. RMA is a cattle call. The office is always packed and appointments never take place on time. Dr. Beth McAvey is personal and warm.  She is direct and reply to emails. I felt like a human because I could really tell she cared. I had a full term still birth in 2016, I was 39 weeks pregnant and I lost my son to an umbilical cord accident. When I started seeing her she was nothing but human, and caring and understood my fears and anxieties after such a huge loss. There were so so many patients in and out of RMA - there would often be at least 20 other women in the waiting room while I was there. Dr Stein did not seem to remember my case well (I had had a horrible miscarriage with gushing blood for 12 days, came to see him to make sure I wasn't hemorrhaging and he helped break up the clots, and then had no memory a short time later as to why I would be anemic. Also didn't seem to check my chart). 
I found him dismissive and not patient with my questions.
Having said that, despite the huge amount of patients at RMA, overall I thought they did a good job in making patients feel heard - I just didn't necessarily feel that with Dr Stein.  Dr. Kudesia was very understanding of our situation.  We were grieving from the loss of our daughter who died shortly after she was born and found ourselves faced with infertility.  Dr. Kudesia was incredibly sympathetic and available to meet with us on a regular basis to patiently answer all of our questions about medicated cycles, IUI and IVF. Dr. Sandler was thorough and quite knowledgeable. As he got to know me he certainly warmed up. He spoke quickly and sometimes at length, needing to be redirected to my questions or reason for the visit. Most of the nurses and doctors at RMA were kind, friendly, and sensitiveDr. Flisser took true ownership of our fertility process.  On multiple occasions he made it apparent that he was going to be the one present for me because I was “his,” patient. He would not show up to procedures he said he would do, he would want to trigger me early and I would have to correct him, he did the same cycle 5 times when I asked him specifically to change protocol that wasn't working. He advised me against a laparoscopy and I went and had one with another doctor and they found moderate endometriosis. I felt treated like a human because I was always greeted and cared for.  My questions were always answered and I was never rushed.  Dr. Lederman and all of his staff really seemed to care and hope for the best possible outcome for all of their patients. Right from the first visit the Dr. Stein was very empathetic and caring, but also very practical with reference to treatment options. The team made sure I was comfortable through out the treatment with regard to each aspect and answered questions without any hesitation. There was a complete lack of communication between the doctors, nurses and financial/ insurance authorization department. Multiple doctors would see me and information was not getting communicated to my primary doctor, Dr. Thornton. The nurses would send me for blood work to their Madison location only to find out that certain tests had to be done through quest diagnostics. I had to get blood taken at multiple times at different locations due to communication problems with the RMA’s authorization protocol. Also, when I was miscarriage get no doctors on call would get back to me. RMA does not give out direct lines to your doctors or nurses assigned to you, so when you call in with a question or problem, it takes 20 minutes to get to the right person’s voicemail Then, you have to wait for a call back which was complete inconvenient because you get caught in a game of phone tag without anyone actually answering your question.  RMA’s system of communicationis completely unrealistic exspecially as a full time professional. The nurses who take your blood are rude and have awful bedside manner. The just see you as a number and do not treat you as a patient. When I was spotting, I went to go and get my levels checked to see how the pregnancy was doing and the nurse got annoyed with me that I went after monitoring hours! Even after I told her what the situation was and informed her of my past two miscarriages! Do not go here if you want to be treated like a human being Dr Lederman was respectful and took adequate time to answer my questions. He treated me as an individual case, not as a number.He always greeted with smile, willing to answer questions via email. If I was not seeing Dr. Stein for monitoring the other doctors knew my case. I love Dr Stein and his staff. They were sweet and understanding. I got to know them well over the months. They truely care about you, and answer all your questions. I thought he and his team were unethical because they kept pushing for procedures and tests that seem unnecessary- he looked at my blood reports and ultrasound and told me that I needed aggressive fertility treatment immediately-that while there was no bad news there was no good news either.
I'd been referred by my obgyn who told me that even though my results were excellent (he said ""your numbers are that of a woman 10 years younger"") he couldn't determine why I hadn't conceived after trying for 3 months and if I wanted I should speak to a fertility specialist to explore my options.I cannot sing the praises enough of RMA New York. They are so efficient, professional, and caring. The doctors are extremely busy and have a lot of patients to see, but I always felt like they answered my questions, and if I had follow up questions I would then speak to a nurse. The nurses were beyond responsive, approachable, and extremely sensitive and helpful. Dr. Sandler would tell it to me like it was, he was realistic about expectations, and he did not give me false hope. Dr. Sandler gave me options, he recommended what was best, and it resulted in a viable pregnancy. I will forever be grateful to him and his practice. Felt rushed through visits and had to be incredibly forceful to have a chance to ask questions. Did not feel he really wanted to answe my questions. Did not give us a thorough diagnosis or explain the process and possible setbacks that can happen during an IVF cycle.Dr. Kudesia has a warm and friendly personality so it was easy to connect to her.I think this is more a result of the clinic I visited than the doctor. I was recommended by my OBGYN to go to RMANY. RMA has great numbers, they see probably thousands of patients, they have a system set up to get you in and out the door, on a protocol, and processed. It's like a machine, somewhat well oiled, with the exception of their finance department which seems in a bit of disarray. I think being just another number is okay if the protocol works for you, and it does for many. I have a friend and also my OBGYN that have had success for RMA. Unfortunately this was not the case for me and I feel like I could have done with more specialized attention and personalized protocol. When my first IUI failed, I was very anxious in finding out the reason for the treatment not to work. She didn't take the time to explain she just said sometimes there's no explanation. During my second treatment, I insisted on running tests to see if there are other issues with me since the second IUI also failed but she said nothing seems to be wrong. She didn't make any helpful suggestions to put me at ease about why my IUIs keep failing or what I should do as my next step. I felt that I was just one of the many ""numbers"" she had to get through for the day and she didn't take the time to explain to me what I can do to help my odds.Dr. Flisser gives out his email address and always responds within a day or two. He makes times to talk to you on the phone and candidly answers all questions.After our first less-than-ideal egg retrieval, Dr. Copperman called us to discuss what went wrong and what we needed to change to improve our chances if we were to try again. He followed up a few days after we learned that all of our embryos had arrested to make sure we were doing okay. I really appreciated that he was concerned for our well-being. Although I saw the doctor briefly during treatment, he was kind, focused and answered all my questions and comments. 

I once called to his office to ask some follow up questions but he wasn't available at that specific moment. Less than two hours later he personally called me back to follow up on my questions.  Dr. Mukherjee seemed to grieve with me when I experienced losses and cheer us on as we tried again.  He knew our personal situation and inquired appropriately; he made great efforts to help us negotiate IVF process financially as we were out of pocket.  He's a lovely man who seems to genuinely care for patients.  The good and not so good: 
Not so good: During monitoring sessions, the interaction with Dr Copperman was brief but he aligned my monitoring days to his rostered days so I was able to see him. I only figured this out towards the end of my retrieval cycle - I would not have gone to RMANY west for monitoring if I had known this from the start. 
He didn’t really address my questions well during the monitoring sessions.
The good/great:
Twice, I wrote an email to Dr Copperman with some late night anxieties / questions. One was on Thanksgiving Day. On both occasions, he wrote back same day, answering my questions without making me feel like I was hassling him or asking stupid questions. 
I was surprised to find out that you may not necessarily get your Dr for your retrieval / transfer procedures - that it just depended on whose day your procedures happened to fall.  This was not the case at the other clinics (in LA and Australia) where the default was your Dr would operate unless they were on leave. I made a request to the clinic and directly to dr Copperman and both times, he said he would do his best to move things around and both times, he turned up!! For my retrieval, I’m pretty sure he really did move his schedule as they told me that I had another Dr while I was in the waiting room ... and then dr Copperman showed up! His operating bedside manner was great - positive, empathetic, focused.
In summary, not every in-person interaction with Dr Copperman is consistent but it was always great when it really counted.I always felt ""like a human"" with Dr. Flisser himself. I don't know if it's RMA or just the process, but with so many visits to take blood and for monitoring, sometimes that part of the experience can feel a little like a factory and ""a number"". He answered any and all questions, was available for phone calls if I had concerns. Made sure I understood the procedure and all possible outcomes. The clinic is busy, and runs very efficiently. Waiting during monitoring visits can make you feel like a number, but once you are with Dr. Flisser, he answers all questions, and does not seem rushed. Dr. Stein is very scientific and accurate and won't hide anything if he feels so. He reacts quick to test results he sees. This might be the right way to do it although sometimes it could give us some mental stress. In the end it turned out that he did the right thing and made right decisions. Dr Jeffrey klein made my husband and I feel like humans rather than a number. He takes as much time as you need to talk at every apnt even if it is just a quick monitoring.  I also love that 24/7 you can email him directly and he ALWAYS responds within minutes.From the moment we walked into RMA we were treated SO well.  We had been through 3 different doctors and other clinics and at 42 I was at my last attempt to try to get pregnant and needed a doctor who could give me an honest, realistic assessment of our chances.  Dr Copperman immediately took the time to get to know us, who we were, and what we had been going through.  He educated us, gave us an honest assessment of our chances and made us feel like real partners with him on our pregnancy journey.Human but I did feel that at times he forgot my name, case. I felt like a number because this Dr. only seemed to show compassion when it came to deciding to do my IVF with him. He was not willing to listen to my ideas of things to do differently this round since I had 2 failed IVFs prior to him. He seemed stubborn on his ways to repeat the same medications like my previous IVFs just at a lower dose. I did get pregnant but my baby stopped growing at 5 1/2 weeks. He had to induce a miscarriage using cytomel and it was pretty traumatizing. When I asked why did this PGD normal embryo stop growing he answered "" you are just unlucky"". I will NEVER forget that. I'd say on balance, I felt more like a number.  The cycle process itself is very ""cattle-cally"" with little time spent with the patient.  This did not bother me so much because I understand they have to see a lot of patients, and it is very much a ""numbers"" game.

When I miscarried my genetically-tested embryo, I felt I could have used a little more sympathy and care from Dr. Grunfeld.  He said he was ""sorry"" and knew it was ""disappointing"" but at my follow up appointment (after the miscarriage and after the second failed cycle) was all about statistics and why I should keep going, with little thought to what I had been through.The clinic saw a lot of patients, and I always felt like Dr. Sandler had to look at a file to remember my name.  But I also felt that the staff upon retrieval and transfer were so kind and helpful, which I believe is when it really mattered most.I didn't see him much, but when I did, he appeared to remember me and took interest in my progress.He was very friendly and always took extra time to answer my questions and involve me in my treatment. He also is very easy to get in touch with. Dr. Stein always knew every detail of our treatment, we saw him regularly as he did our morning monitoring most of the time. Never once did we have to remind him or fill in some gap of knowledge of our history with him (Happen one too many times - scarily - with the previous doctor we saw)Dr. McAvey was warm and took the time to share information and answer questions. She was receptive to email communication.I really struggled with my experience at RMA. I really liked Dr. Copperman when I met with him so I knew going in he knew what he was doing. After the initial one on one meeting, nothing about the experience was personal. I almost never saw my own doctor, i always seemed to speak to a different nurse, and overall communication with the nurses was poor. The most obvious reason why i felt like a number was the atmosphere of the clinic, it has a ""herding cattle"" atmosphere. There are always at least 20 people in the waiting room if not 40. When we were with Dr. Lederman for a sit-down appointment he would take his time, never rushing us, and discuss whatever we needed.  For anything else-- monitoring, egg retrieval, embryo transfer-- we rarely saw him and just had to take whoever was on staff that day,See my previous statement. I definitely feel like a person there, and not a number. RMA is a huge practice.  This has its benefits, but for me, it seemed to have more drawbacks.  I never spoke directly with Dr. Sandler when I had a question or corner, nor did I have contact information for a specific nurse or assistant.  Each time I called I would have to give a brief overview of my history and a different person would contact me.  There were times when I was given two different answers to the same question and had to navigate very confusing waters with little direction.  Everyone was nice enough, but many times I felt that the person I was dealing with was not looking at me as a human, with very complicated emotions surrounding infertility and the treatments I was going through. Dr. Knopman seemed to understand what I was going through and she had a game plan to help my husband and I achieve our goal of becoming parents. She was always 100% involved in my case and made sure I saw her when I came in for monitoring. She celebrated me when I had success and helped me find confidence when some months didn’t work.  The folks at RMA were always kind, patient and considerate. They were also busy, efficient and tactical. I often felt rushed and like I couldn't ask all of my questions. The doctors always treated me like a human, but I always also felt that I wasn't getting complete information.Dr Stein spent no time explaining what we were trying to achieve in terms of egg freezing, my treatment or otherwise.  I had no idea what was going on and it was my first treatment cycle -- and I've been through 2 more since.  He knew I wanted to preserve my fertility with an egg freeze, but we didn't talk treatment plan, numbers, protocol, nothing.  When I came in for my de-brief after the cycle, I raised this calmly and kindly as something I would have appreciated and he got defensive and literally told me to get out of office!!!!  I told him he could not force me to do that, he had a responsibility to answer my questions about how many eggs I needed to preserve my fertility, to give me a reason why we didn't talk about that number ever or provide me with any information about why he selected my protocol.  It was appalling.  I can't imagine anything worse, really.  Dr. Knopman was very personable and genuine. I felt she treated me as if I were a good friend of hers and she truly wanted us to succeed. Dr. Klein was fine to work with, but I feel he operated off of a script.  I suffered with DOR, and at an advanced age, it was unlikely that I would conceive on my own, however it was early into my treatment and I wanted to exhaust all efforts.  I felt he was pushing us towards using donor eggs very soon into treatment without exploring other options.Dr Talebian was wonderful every step of the way! She always replied to every email and phone call with detailed answers to my questions. She was very approachable and made sure I understood everything. She was kind, generous, funny and always treated me with absolute respect. In a way, I thought it was somewhat reassuring to be treated like a number,  as long as whoever I was dealing with knew my background, where I was in treatment, and so on. The fact that the clinic ran like a well-oiled machine was very comforting because they really did give you the impression they knew what they were doing. I'm also not a person who needs to feel coddled. Dr. Sandler was beyond unhelpful. We were rushed into ivf without being given the proper level of expectation or care. I was not told what to expect or what would be considered success. The practice is large and feels like a human farm. I never had the same doctor twice in daily rotation and for that reason they miss the fact that I had ovulated early - thus a  cancelled cycle. I should have known on my first day of cycling when they had me down for a beta pregnancy test and not to start my ivf cycle. then the finance coordinator Hira NEVER met with us - declined to show up for a scheduled appointment and never could answer why all of our insurance money was used for a cycle that never got to a retrieval.Dr. Klein was fine.  But he was a very small part of my experience at RMA.  I only saw him at the very beginning and the very end of my treatment.  Everything in between was a new person or a nurse or a rotating doctor.  I never felt like there was continuity of care or any attention to detail with my case.  The main RMA office in midtown Manhattan is horrible.  The waiting room is HUGE and it really feels like a cattle call of patients.  My egg retrieval experience with RMA was absolutely one of the worst medical experiences of my life.  I asked to meet the doctor before the procedure and was told I couldn't unless it was an emergency of some sort.  When I was ushered into the operating room, loud rock and roll was playing and no one greeted me or made me feel like I was a human being.  I truly felt like a piece of meat on an assembly line.  I got to meet exactly zero people involved with my care -- did not get to meet the anesthesiologist or the embryologist or the primary doctor.  When I was put on the table in the operating room and started weeping because I felt vulnerable and exposed, no one acknowledged me or how I was doing.  In short, no one spoke to me.  I was truly just a piece of meat.  Horrific.  dr flisser was very direct with the medical information and took the time to explain to us the process, and options, and what he thought was the issue, unfortunately didn't have a clear cut diagnosis, but the catch all ""unexplained infertility"".  However, he's not the most warm and fuzzy- he's not going to tell jokes and give hugs, but if you're someone who needs to be completely in the loop of the medical knowledge and the process, he'll make sure that happens. Also, the nature of the RMA practice, it's a little like a casting call, does add to the feeling of being a ""number"" The waiting room procedure made me feel like a numbe . Also Flisser's reaction to my lab results and his  canceling retrieval based on poor stimulation response made me feel like a number.While the clinic is very large, I felt like he understood my case, and tried to tweak protocols to better my chances. When you are sitting in the waiting room though, it can feel a little bit like you are a number. It's a busy practice and they have limited time to spend with each patient. At the same time, everyone was friendly and courteous and all my questions were answered. Dr Mukherjee replied to my emails quickly and with a meaningful response. The treatment prescribed was not working and I was becoming increasingly frustrated. He was surprised it wasn't working (so, honest) but still thinking of the next step and never gave me a sense of doom. As it turns out the one cycle I did with him worked, so that may give me rose-colored glasses. But overall it was a positive and warm experience which felt more human than ""factory line"". The office that Dr. Lederman practiced out of in Mt. Kisco was very small.  There were only 4 people in the office, Dr. Lederman, his 2 nurses and the office manager.   Every time I walked into the office, everyone knew me by name.  I never had to check in at the front desk, because the office manager knew me immediately and would let them know I was there.

The nurses were great, and were very compassionate when a cycle didn't work.  They were also very happy when a cycle did work.  They would hug us as we graduated to our OB.  

Dr. Lederman was the only doctor that I dealt with (there were a few times that I had to have a transfer or a retrieval done by someone else).  He would call with results and would sit with us after a cycle didn't work.  He was willing to work with me and listen to my ideas about what I could do differently.  

As someone who suffered through so many rounds of fertility treatments, I did a lot of internet research.  I would also ask Dr. Lederman what he thought about the latest thing that I read about.  Instead of making me feel like an idiot or just dismissing it, he would listen and encourage me to do what I felt would make me feel better.  I'm not saying that trying the things I read on the internet helped, but if nothing else, they may have put my mind in the right place.

I can't say enough about Dr. Lederman and his team.  Not once did he ever make me feel discouraged.  We 100% felt like patients.  Dr. Copperman and I even joked about the intensity of signing up for Soul Cycle (NYC spinning class).  The other doctors at RMA also were good at getting to know us.  Everyone from the front desk to Dr. Copperman would know who we are (granted we were there ALL the time, as you know....).  Despite all of above, the RMA team was still very efficient at getting all the patients in and out of monitoring, which as we know, is the most daunting.  Even after our son was born, and we brought him into RMA, Dr. Copperman clearly remembered us.Dr Grunfeld always gave me his time and explained everything with patience and care. He responded to emails and calls right away (either personally or via his nurse) He also made me feel like he was disappointed when I was disappointed and he was optimistic when I couldn't be. I felt like he was a cheerleader all along.He seemed very busy and while I feel he gave me the numbers and information, I also felt he was very booked and ready to see the next patient.  I wish he would have explained to me sooner before all the pills and iuis and 4 ivfs that my numbers were very dismal.  I am not sure why he even tried the iuis or tried it more than once.  I feel RMA in general is just a factory.  When I was under Dr. Flisser's care, I almost always saw him.  He made an effort to coordinate all my appointments around his schedule (as best we could given my cycle), he called me after my first failed transfer and met with both me and my husband on several occasions.  He never once rushed us out of his office or failed to thoughtfully answer any of my questions.  When I was sobbing crying, unable to go into the transfer room, he did not rush me.  He gave me time and space to pull myself together.  Sometimes I feel like male doctors dont really ""get it"" - they have never been on 1,000 hormones before.  But, I felt like Dr. Flisser did get it.  He is a husband and a dad and I think that made him very relatable.  We LOVE Dr. Flisser.  I could not have loved Jaime Knapman more.  She gave it to me straight in a way that let me know she respected my intelligence, but she did it with warmth and grace.  She told me all the upsides and downsides, always answered my questions honestly and eagerly, and to top it all off has a good sense of humor.  When I had an issue after my retrieval (which was not done by her due to timing out of our control) she was there with me on cell over the weekend going above and beyond.it feels like a factory.  the morning check-in for blood and ultrasound are very crowded.  you have to wait, sometimes up to 45 minutes to get in for blood and then wait again for a doctor to come see you. then if you have additional questions you have to wait for a nurse.  when you are cycling through for IVF and have to be there almost daily for 10 days its hard not to feel frustrated and just a number.  I felt like a human.  The only problem I had was that I was always asked to sign in when I arrived at the office and then the sign in sheet was left out for everyone to see.  I was concerned about my privacy and how the lack thereof could affect me at work.  The receptionist laughed about me crossing out my name when I left, and I told her that it wouldn't be funny if I lost my job.  Hopefully they've become more careful about privacy.He was always aware of what was going on with me and where I  was in my treatment. I was explained throughly what they were looking for during my cycle.He reviewed with me my previous cycle in their clinic while I was in the consultation. He listened and answered all my questions during the visit. Dr.Stein took the time to meet with my husband and I during our consultation, during which, we did not feel rushed or pushed out the door. He listened to both of our concerns and feelings.Dr. Kimberley A. Thornton is sweet and she answered my emails usually within a day.This doctor is warm, compassionate, and genuinely interested in a successful outcome for his patients. I felt like we were truly on this journey together. Dr. Stein addressed my questions and concerns, but I felt a bit that they were brushed away (perhaps to ease my concerns) in an unhelpful way when I would've preferred a more serious, detailed response. The exam itself was very quick and I felt unnecessary since I already had results from a previous doctor and he seemed too in a rush anyway.He is really concerned about every aspect in my health not only physical or gynaecology, also how I feel, about my mental health. So this make me feel like a personI constantly feel like I’m taking up his time, annoying him with all my questions. He seems reluctant to talk to me, and doesn’t seem to pay any special attention to the specifics of my situation.She is very warm and remembered my personal situation when I was with her. Thoughtful discussion of my background, warm coupled with insight and knowledge. Conversational, but direct.Doctor Sandlers was nice to explain me everything. When the 1st cycle with him, couple time he did the ultrasound during the injection timeline instead of the tech, since I have serious low egg quality. 
For the 2nd time he willing to try again even my change only egg donor. Give me hope.I feel like he genuinely cares about me, but I also feel like he has a million patients and doesn’t remember all the details of my history (without looking it up) and sometimes changes his advice in unexpected ways - also sometimes difficult to get in touch with Very understanding, she explains well and has a great bedside manner.The office moves quick at times. I feel like I have a lot of unanswered questions that requires me to email or call the office at a later point.Dr. Lekovich took over my case from another doctor. She was very easy to talk to and made me feel at easy since I didn’t start this process with her. While Dr. Stein is very approachable and willing to answer questions by email, phone or appointment, he does have a very large number of clients (as you would expect from RMA NY). I did not always see him during monitoring and when I did, time was often limited. 

Also, while he was very good about tempering expectations, I felt there was a lot of emphasis on only my age and not further exploration of other contributing factors.I felt like a human with the doctor but more of a number with the clinic.  Nurses that called didn’t seem to know me or my case and I had to know what my own protocol was if it was different than their standard.While she was not the doctor that performed my retrieval, she took the time to thoroughly review my history and review everything with me so she was completely up to speed when she took over my case.There are too many patients in this clinic. On the weekend i had to travel to NYC for monitoring (the Garden City office is closed on weekends) and many times I had to wait 1-1.5 hours to do an ultrasound and blood work.He was patient, answered a MILLION questions, even via email in weekends. He was truthful and also kind and caring. I felt like I was in really good, caring hands.Lack of communication, compassion, and time actually spent with the Doctor.He was always there to answer questions, he was the one who monitored most of my appointments, he explained everything very well every step along the way, he was compassionate and kind, gave me options, his staff was wonderful. Dr Mukherjee genuinely care about his patients and took the time to talk at length with me and my husband, who is also a physician and had very detailed questions. He was responsive by email and his staff followed up in a caring and patient manner as well. Dr Stein was questioning my decision to undergo IVF for the purpose of embryo cryopreservation due to my partner's age.  I thought it was very inappropriate.  Dr. Sandler was compassionate and patient with me. He was honest yet comforting.the doctor was always available either by phone, or email. the nursing staff was knowledgeable and superb in returning both emails and phone calls
Dr Knopman is incredibly caring and easy to talk to. She is also very responsive so no matter how silly my question, she would answer it immediately with a bunch of information. Dr. Copperman is very professional and gets to the point - which I appreciate.  When we learned that I had premature ovary aging, he came up with a plan of attack and is the reason why I have two chromosomally normal frozen embryos.  He modified the protocol and kept me going even though I did not have egg retrieval until day 15 - he would not give up and kept me motivated the whole way.  He is, of course, a wealth of knowledge but also a great supporter, and I felt that he was truly invested in making my cycles successful.Clinic felt very factory likeBottom line, she cared about me and my pregnancy.  She was available by email and phone.  I ran into her in an airport a few years later and she called my name across the concourse, remembering me, my miscarriage, and my pregnancy.  It felt like we were a team.I felt like from the getgo Dr. Sandler was very honest- never giving me false hope, but making me believe he would do anything he could to ensure I was successful. He spent over an hour with me at our first meeting, and was always patient, honest, and practical. He did not want to continue a cycle if it wasn't looking good, and was cognizant of me as a person. He is not what I would describe as ""warm and fuzzy"" but inspired confidence in me as a patient that he would do whatever he could to ensure the best out come. Dr Flisser always took the time to talk to me and answer all of my questions. He would often stay and just chat because he is a nice person. The truth about fertility clinics is that they treat thousands of people at a time, they might see hundreds in a day during monitoring hours. Dr Flisser always made me feel like he had time for me despite how many people were waiting out in the waiting room. He did get to know us individually and made sure we knew that we could reach him via email if needed to answer any questions along the way. I liked that he gave us all of the different options and issues that may crop up from beginning to end and even told us to discuss payment options with finance since there were a few different ways we could go about paying since it was out of pocket.He was generally kind but showed little to no emotion.   In my 2nd and final iVF I had a miscarriage scare while traveling for work in HK and a HK doctor had wrongly told me I had a miscarriage.  Fortunately, a second doctor told me everything was fine, but when I got back to NYC, Dr. Cooperman was somehow mad at me for the whole thing, which was a little heartless and ridiculous.Office staff was curt or even rude. Plan of care was ""by the book"" not necessarily to my specifics. Ectopic preg was completely missed as a preg test was not done to confirm neg outcome of IUI. was most impressed with the office staff - Heidi was Dr. Coppermann's nurse and I did feel like she genuinely cared about what we were going through.  She was very patient and explained everything in great detail. She is empathetic and relatable. He always remembered my name and personal things about me.I came into the consultation with almost 10 pages of questions-seriously. He patiently answered every single one.I felt like a number when dealing with other staff but with Dr. Lekovich herself I felt a connection. I feel that she was personally invested in my journey and my care. She even allowed me to email her and would respond in a timely manner. Fantastic bedside manner; always available to speak via phone or email. He was very sensitive during hard times and willing to connect us with any other health professionals we needed when we were testing for a genetic condition. We felt completely safe and reassured in his hands. Dr. Stein was personable and made it feel like he was always cheering on us with every week that went by. It was like seeing an old friend. He was cautious but optimistic and provided excellent and thorough care. He spoke directly to me instead of at me and without hesitation or personal feelings he was very blunt, which I prefer in a doctor.Dr Stein was very honest and direct.  He  explained every step clearly and him and his team were very responsive.  The only reason why I feel like a number is because when I go to RMA, I almost never see Dr. Copperman.Dr Copperman was empathetic and always available for questions.  The office has a high volume and during the morning monitoring it felt more like a clinic but the doctor was great outside of that experience. He took time always to answer all of my questions and talk through my different ideas and options.Dr. Flisser took his time talking to us and answering questions. Outside of appointments all communication was with office staff.I felt that Dr. Davis genuinely cared about us and wanted us to be successful just as much as we did.Dr. Copperman met with me and my partner before each step. He was very patient and spent a lot of time answering our questions. Did not explain well and was not warm.He was direct and honest. He remembers all patience and tries to be as present as possible.He was honest and up front about our situation and our options but also down to earth.  I got to know about him and his family.  I feel as if ive know him for years not months.  When I came to him feeling a certain way about something, he listened and resolved it.   Dr. Stein is ""no bullshit"" and seems a little gruff at first, but he's been very reassuring and comforting to me because his bluntness makes me feel like I can trust him. He responded to an email in great detail and pretty quickly.Although RMA has many patients, I always felt that the team knew my case well and was accessible.Dr. Davis smiled and made jokes when he saw me. He responded promptly to all emails. He spoke frankly about alternative treatments. He explained all decisions and all procedures. He actively advocated for me just attending one in a family of clinics and having all of the necessary information handled by the same office.RMA is a mill, the standard answer to questions about tailored treatment is ""every cycle is different,"" and as a patient I was pushed to keep doing IVF cyclesExcellent bedside manner; takes time to really listen to what you have to say and your concerns; really cares about his patients; and does not 'know best', let's you make your own treatment decisions and fully supports them.  
Doctor of osteopathic medicine and incorporated eastern medicine (Chinese herbs, other supplements (CoQ-10, baby ASA), and acupuncture)- all important to me and my partner. The staff was very friendly and the other doctors were great as well. I only saw Dr. Stein for my initial consult and at the end.Dr. Klein is incredibly reachable and responsive.  He answered all of my questions reasonably and bluntly. met dr once and she explained everything extremely quickly. when asked questions to clarify/break down the lingo, she seemed impatient. i felt like she was on the clock and i was allotted only 15 minutes of her consultation time.Although the care is good at RMA and all of the doctors are experienced and knowledgable, they see a high number of patients each day.  They follow a very organized system and the doctors, nurses and office staff provide consistent service but it all seems automatic and hurried.  I didn't often feel like I was able to get enough insight or information - especially when I was in for ultrasounds.  I was usually told that a nurse would call me with results and will let me know what my doctor wants to do as a next step (during monitoring hours, I would see whatever doctor was available and not necessarily my own).  Again, I feel like everyone is well trained and the information is correct but it feels very formulaic and hurried. He is available 24 X 7 by phone or email.  He will ALWAYS return my calls and spend time answering my questions. After miscarrying my first every pregnancy after IVF I was devastated and looking for someone to blame, but he has been there for me every step of the way.Dr Knopman always made me feel like she deeply cared about my treatment- and she invested much more than I heard from my friends in this space. She even emailed on a sunday night to ask how I was feeling!Dr McAvey had a warm bedside manner, emailed and called me personally, didn't make me feel rushed, and seemed genuinely concerned with my success.There are so many patients and you do feel like something in between a number and patient. However, you get a timely response to each email and each call. If you want to see Dr.Grunfeld  he will find the time.  for me it was much more about efficiency and they have a great system that allows you to go through the process and still maintain your life.The moment I felt that she treated me like a human was when on my 4th IUI. Right after she completed the insemination she held up both hands, crossed both sets of fingers, and said ""I'm rooting for you"". It made her feel more like a friend and a cheerleader, rather than just a doctor. I had a major post surgery complication and dealing with Dr. Klein was a nightmare.  He literally yelled at me for calling the service late at night and sent me to the ER rather than talk to me.  I was truly horrified.It's a cattle call but I did like the nurses I met with and I did like dr. Copperman. Dr Klein took the time and met with my husband and I on multiple occasions. One time he felt like he didn't answer all my questions and called me later that day when he had more time to talk. It was very scary time not knowing the outcome but he was greatDr.McAvey is extremely personable and compassionate. Dr. Copperman was straightforward and he provided all information about my case and answered my questions. He was also very kind when I had a miscarriage at month three during my second pregnancy. He was very kind explained every step clearly and interrupted one cycle when he saw my ovaries were not responding accordinglyOversight in my specific profile (in regards to insurance) with led to delay in treatment after 4th IUI. Not much communication during IUI cycle.The Dr was personal and explained my situation and my options in a very clear manner.Mostly rushed during daily checks and not given too much info as in how I’m progressing He explained everything The doctor took time to explain the treatment and options clearly.Dr. Thornton is very caring. She remembers patients--which is a tall order considering how large RMA is! She took the time to speak with my partner after he could not attend the initial consultation. He talked at me and didn’t listen too well. I got pregnant though so he’s the man :)Dr. Stein and his team (specifically His nurse Eliza) were extremely thorough, personable, and understanding. There was acknowledgement when the cycle failed and that we would want some kind of feedback I felt like he really heard our concerns and questions. He was compassionate and kind when we had a miscarriage and was truly thrilled when we had our baby. He was very compassionate throughout my care period.
He was also hands on.Dr Stein is kind, patient, answers all of my questions, and most importantly reassures me. He is thoughtful and gentle.Because his practice is very busy Dr. Stein is a thorough and knowledgeable physician who cares about his patients personally. He is kind and immensely dedicated to being successful for his patients. I had an amazing experience with RMA.   I wanted to give up and they wouldn't let me, Dr. Copperman even called me while on vacation to make sure I was not just physically but mentally ok as well.   I am so  grateful to them for giving me the family I always dreamed of.  She was warm, friendly and reassuring.Dr. Klein is just an amazing, compassionate, caring human and he always made us feel like we were humans, not a number or even a patient.  He always spent a lot of time with us and listened and answered our questions carefully.  He was by far the best doctor I've had in any setting in my life.The team did seem to care about my outcome, but was also relatively unsympathetic and forgetful about the particulars of my situation (having to undergo fertility treatments to conceive because my husband had cancer.)Dr. Lederman always treated me as a valued individual, and was there for me throughout the entire process. Dr copperman was totally aware of all aspects of my case, he was on it and he cared about results as did his whole team. Never felt like a number Both Dr. Sandler and my ivf coordinator always spoke to us as kindly and explained everything clearly and kindlyHe took the time to explain everything to me and was warm.Spoke in a language we can understand.At every monitoring session, I got to see a doctor.  Dr Flisser if possible, but always a doctor.  Also, Dr Flisser answered (promptly) his own emails.  Always knew who I was and my history. When I found out my pregnancy had lost the heartbeat while he was doing an ultrasound he was unbelievably kind Alan was caring and especially good to me as a SMC to be. There were many factors that contributed to this.  He took the time to look at my records and perform a thorough ultrasoundI feel like he saw my chart and assessed fairlythe whole process is extremely impersonal. there are usually 30 women in the waiting area at any given time, you never know what doctor will be doing your sonogram, there is no personalized attention with who calls you with daily updates, you rarely see your own doctor and the protocol is extremely cookie cutter.Rather impersonal, focused on percentages and details rather than treating the whole person.The care team definitely made me feel like I was important. Dr. Stein knew me by name after my first consultation appointment. When I came back to the office with a positive result, the nurses all seemed genuinely happy for me and my husband.He was patient and took time to explain everything to me. I was able to email him and he responded both professionally and in a warm manner. He was fabulous!Dr. Copperman was professional but also very kind.  He was very supportive of my goals to have a child.thought he respected me as a person - would have liked to have individualized my plan a bit morehe listened to our concerns. Really treated me as a whole person - from head to toe - taking into account psychological state as well as physical state.Because he was very empathetic when dealing with me.  He speaks very quickly and doesn't leave a lot of time to ask questions, but if you are assertive, he responds. Became warmer once he got to know me.She took the time to answer my questions and was compassionate about my miscarriage.Clinic is huge, Copperman is not charismatic.Spoke to me like a real person with a brain; wasn't flustered when I got emotional; spent time explaining things; was positive but honest. Dr Sandler was very personable and remembered previous discussions and was very honestThe staff was very warm and I felt like they genuinely cared about my well being. RMA is a factory. I wouldn't recommend it.Dr. Grunfeld was great.  There were other doctors in the practice that I didn't like nearly as much.If you have experienced any level of infertility, you know how overwhelming everything can feel. We were referred to Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York by my OBGYN when I was diagnosed with PCOS, and my husband's sperm analysis showed his morphology was less than normal. I chose the westside location as it was close to my office. Our appointment was scheduled with Dr. Stein, and his team made us feel comfortable with the process as soon as we walked in the door.

The staff at the front desk welcome and greet you when you sign in- every time you enter. For our first appointment we met with Dr. Stein to discuss our situation: current test results done by my OBGYN, review additional testing that would be done to determine next steps, and anything else we had on our mind - he clearly answered all questions, comments, etc, no matter how crazy my internet based questions were! We then met with our assigned nurse, Eliza, who reviewed our upcoming testing schedule with us. Eliza was amazing, always answering my emails in a timely manner, again no matter how crazy the question, and was always very comforting on the phone. 

Once all results were back we went back in to meet with Dr. Stein to discuss our options. He clearly went over all options available to us, and provided his recommendation on what he thought would be best. We decided to move forward with IUI per his recommendation as he did not think we needed to start with anything too invasive at first, planning to do three rounds before reassessing our options.

IUI requires a few visits to the office each cycle - blood work, follicle monitoring, and the actual IUI procedure itself (you both need to go in that day!). Dr. Stein performed our first IUI procedure, and did so clearly explaining each step, and injecting just the right amount of humor into it all to help us feel more relaxed! While we did not necessarily see Dr. Stein or Eliza at all of those appointments over the three months, we felt very comfortable and in great hands with the doctors and nurses we did see. 

When we had an unsuccessful third IUI attempt, we were obviously upset and disappointed. I spoke with Eliza, who was the support I needed at the time, as I did not know what to do next as I was so accustomed to going in for day 1 blood work to start my next IUI cycle. As our follow up appointment with Dr. Stein was not for another two weeks, she suggested that my husband and I consider trying just one more time so we did not have to spend two weeks just waiting around. We decided to give it one more go.

After the fourth IUI procedure, before it was time to take a pregnancy test, we had our follow up with Dr. Stein to discuss next steps. He went over the entire IVF process. We left that appointment feeling hopeful and excited to get that next process started. We felt that we were in the best hands. I was more relaxed after that meeting than I had been since before we initially met with him to start IUI... perhaps that is what helped lead to a positive pregnancy test with our fourth IUI cycle! I got the call from Eliza confirming that the blood work showed I was pregnant - she was as happy as we were!

Tomorrow I will be 20 weeks pregnant with our son. We are so thankful to Dr. Stein, Eliza, and the entire team at RMA of NY Westside for their support throughout this process. I would highly recommend them to anyone encountering fertility issues. We definitely plan on going back when we are ready for baby number 2. Dr Stein was always extremely respectful, warm, informative, positive, and helpful with all of the many questions my partner and I had over the 2 treatments to become pregnant. I felt like a human during my meetings with Dr Mukherjee. When I was worried about my bHCG numbers with my second pregnancy, he called me to reassure me. He made sure to do 2/3 of my embryo transfers. However, the day to day process made me feel like a number. The morning monitoring situation was insane, like a cattle call. And the daily updates and instructions were given by a nurse.Dr.Klein is a superb doctor that is always attentive to his patients needs. You will always get a response back from Dr.Klein no matter what day or time it is. He makes you feel like you matter and that your goal is his goal too. Dr. Flisser is very personable and caring. He made sure to review my results even when while he was on vacation. He also kept his word about being there during the embryo transfer. He went above and beyond.She is very kind and took all of the time that we needed to answer all questions. I did need to do my own research to present ideas to her to try certain things that she did not initially consider doing. She is thorough and listens to all of your concerns. Dr. Lederman has always made himself available and responded quickly to questions.  He has been compassionate and doesn't talk too clinical, so we can understand.  I would say the same thing about his staff.  This a very difficult process and just about everyone at RMA has tried to make it easier.Dr Stein made me feel like a human he took his time to talk to listen to our question and explained everything to us.She always greeted my partner and I, asked us how we were, made a point to say she was happy to see us. I felt like she was rooting for us. It's extremely hard to feel like a human at a facility such as RMA.  They see so many patients every day and you are not always seen by your main doctor so you don't feel like anyone really knows your situation/case very well.Dr Stein has a lot of patients.  A lot.  And sometimes it feels like it but you go to him for his expertise and results. Personal and detailed care, concidered our personal circumstances and recommended accordinglyDr. Copperman has always given me his honest expert opinion -- many times in person -- even when the news was not what I necessarily wanted to hear.  During the period of 4 years, from the time I underwent and completed an elective egg freezing cycle to ultimately using donor eggs to conceive a daughter with my now-husband, I've always found Dr. Copperman and his team accessible, concerned and deeply committed my success.I had a fantastic experience with RMA and Dr. Stein in particular. He is obviously very good at what he does and also has a great personality. He was always warm and friendly when in the room with me and he made time to answer all my questions without making me feel rushed.RMA is extremely busy and its understandable that you don't always get the one on one care that you expect when you pay 20k for treatmentDr Copperman and his nurses Jordyn and Sam were so helpful during my treatment. They were so responsive and caring, I couldn’t have asked for better partners. Dr. Stein asked personal questions and got to know me, my partner, and my family—all information that he included in his treatment plan.She was very sensitive to my feelings. If I seemed hopeful about something she was positive with me to the very end, never letting me lose hope. I loved that.Dr Flisser listened to us from the very beginning.  He was able to explain his recommended approach in ways that worked for both me and my husband who process things differently.  And he showed empathy, enthusiasm and authentic support throughout the process.  I appreciated him always answering my questions in a way that made me feel like nothing was too small or dumb to ask and when I felt anxious, he responded with empathy.  Dr. Stein has great bedside manner and a great sense of humor. He is great at making you feel comfortable and addresses any concerns you might have in a real way. He doesn't always sugar coat it, but at the same time he puts you at ease when worrying is not necessary.The treatment and care felt very sincere.Sometimes I felt like a number, when I wasn't sure if they were paying attention to my cycle and upcoming start dates and the needs attached to it (e.g. getting meds delivered around travel schedules). But overall, the nurses were very friendly and available - by email, phone, and in person. And when I did need to ask Dr. Copperman questions or have him give me extra time and attention, he gave it to me upon asked, with wisdom, but also kindness and sincerity.She was compassionate and caring. Dr Stein and all the staff at RMA always greets me with a smile. They strive and go above and beyond to make sure all their patients are comfortable. He was kind, caring, honest, and included my husband in our conversations.Dr. Stein and his team where very thoughtful and informative.  They treated me with good bed-side manner and personalized attentionThe Doctor had a great understanding of what our outcome would be based on our health and condition. He was also matter of fact which is something we appreciated. Dr. Stein greeted us by name, asked about our family, gave us time to ask questions and observe the process and really take it in and enjoy it.Dr Sekhon is extremely personable.  In my first consultation, she sat down with me for some time and explained the egg freezing process in great detail.  She really listened to my concerns, did not try to sell me, and was honest about outcomes in a way that was backed by numbers.  
During the 10-day injection process, I had questions about dosage twice and RMA's nurse hotline answered immediately.  Dr. Lederman was very thoughtful and caring.  He always answered any questions and concerns I had, and took the time to explain in detail every part of the IVF process. ",7.799999999999984,7.899999999999985,"Dr. Copperman was a phenomenal communicator. for my actual IUIs, she only performed one and other doctors did the other two. Dr. Lekovich is always honest and clear in her approach, along with reasoning for why she implements specific treatment planning. Because of a hearing disability I have I had the doctor repeat himself multiple times and to speak slowly when asked so i can write his answers down on a notebook. She is proactive in making adjustments in treatments, and has taken the time to explain all steps and answer even the smallest of questions. Dr. Sekhon is very informative and when we speak with her, she is thorough in her responses (vs on email sometimes we have to ask multiple questions to gain full clarity).I truly cannot express how wonderful Dr. Flisser was. He clearly cares about his patients and wants them to succeed at having a healthy pregnancy. I felt like he really wanted me to have success and get pregnant quickly and safely. He seemed to have little time for me and didn't answer my questions. I can't complain because we have so far gotten the results we wanted. Dr. Flisser was always aware of everything that was going on with my cycle. He also made it a point to say he is always available through email or if you call the office. I personally appreciated that Dr. Davis has a holistic approach to treatment and I took advantage of the on-staff nutritionist (Dara Godfrey) and took him up on suggestion to try acupuncture as well. Although RMA is very busy and truly runs a large-scale operation, I found them to be extremely sensitive, considerate, and reachable. He is a nice person, very well experienced in the field, and he will answer questions if you have them but he (and RMA) seem to be very set on their standard mode of operations. I know others who have had infertility challenges and one thing I like most about Dr. Flisser's approach is that he covers all the bases up front. Dr. Flisser's demeanor is pretty direct and to the point, which I really liked because I wasn't given false promises or hope, just the facts in what was already an emotional time. She was extremely positive about my chances. I told Dr. Stein that my body responds very badly to birth control pills and that was why I've never been on them for any length of time. He always let me feel like I had control over what was happening in my treatments. I knew about Dr. Grunfeld's excellence and knowledge, yet his humble and down to earth personality made me feel that he was approachable and truly cared about the outcome of our treatments (Not just my payments). I never felt she talked down to me, and she kept me absolutely as informed as I wanted to be throughout the entire process. I got pregnant on my first try, with two back to back IUI's. My embryos didn't last until day 5 and I never had a transferred with total 50 eggs retrieved as RMA doesn't do day 3 transfer. At this point he knows my history and has given me my amazing child so it’s hard to have negative feelings, but I do which he were a little more aware of the psychological and emotional implications of this process. She explained everything thoroughly and made sure that I was fully aware of each stage, empowering me to be my own advocate for treatment as well as having her on my side. I had questions along the way which he addressed with patience and understanding. Dr. Klein was almost malicious to me during a post-surgery complication. Sandler was nice and he explained everything very well, even though we had no luck in both our treatments with him (one miscarriage and one negative test with donors eggs), I really really like the structure/administration they have at the clinic, they say they will call at 5 with results and the really do. after my day 3 bloodwork he had a nurse tell me that I have diminished ovarian reserve and shes so sorry. I was very happy with Dr Ledermanns care. Dr. Stein is knowledgeable and a straight-shooter. I appreciated that he shared his opinion and recommendations on my IVF decisions and personally answered any questions I had in our consults and over email. That said, my bigger problems were with the clinic, which made numerous mistakes during the process...but should go back to better doctor oversight (eg, forgot about prescribing and telling my husband to take antibiotics before giving his sample - luckily we have been through this enough at other clinics that we knew to ask)Dr Lederman took the time to answer all our questions, was friendly and compassionate I would say it was in between. He also explained his approach, and was available by phone and email. He also gave me more information following a physical exam. Thornton rarely made herself available to speak with me regarding medication questions and concerns I had. While the clinic is definitely a 'by the number' clinic - Dr. Lekovich herself was warm, interested, and responsive. She was very open and forthcoming about everything. If I was not seeing Dr. Stein for monitoring the other doctors knew my case. Made sure I understood the procedure and all possible outcomes. He was very friendly and always took extra time to answer my questions and involve me in my treatment. I told him he could not force me to do that, he had a responsibility to answer my questions about how many eggs I needed to preserve my fertility, to give me a reason why we didn't talk about that number ever or provide me with any information about why he selected my protocol. I feel like he genuinely cares about me, but I also feel like he has a million patients and doesn’t remember all the details of my history (without looking it up) and sometimes changes his advice in unexpected ways - also sometimes difficult to get in touch with Very understanding, she explains well and has a great bedside manner. Dr. Sandler was compassionate and patient with me. Dr. Copperman was straightforward and he provided all information about my case and answered my questions. He is kind and immensely dedicated to being successful for his patients."
22,RMA of New York,advice,"RMA NY generally is a big, popular clinic that has a high volume of patients. I didn't care about that as long as I was under the care and supervision of Dr. Copperman. Just know that the clinic is very busy so don't expect the doctor or nurses to spend a lot of time with you. They will answer questions, but they will mostly go through their general activities and inform you if everything is ok or not. Be prepared with a list of questions and paper/pen. He can be quick when he walks you through problems/next steps/etc. Very open to answering questions, but if you don't have any prepared, the meeting might be over before you had time to think of them.Know that the clinic itself has pitfalls particularly the east side office. But they are very effective. Overall worth it because he is a kind and effective doctor but have eyes open that the east side office is unpleasant at best and you have to go there for retrievals and transfers and on weekends. Ask questions and advocate for yourself. This is a big clinic and there is no hand holding. Dr. Lekovich is smart and committed but it’s not a mom and pop shop so you need to be assertive at times. Ask a lot of questions!  She will explain them.  Make a list for every meeting.  Do not be afraid to ask questions.From the beginning go in there saying you want to know all of your options and the expected results of each options, even if Dr. Stein doesn't agree all the options are the best course of action. Ask any question and express any concern you may have.  Dr. Lekovich has a wealth of knowledge regarding infertility/fertility treatment.  She will be able to provide you with research backing her decision making and treatment planning.  She will also address all questions or concerns without making you feel overwhelmed by information or as if it is an inconvenience.If you have questions, ask them.  If you have concerns, raise them. He will take the time to answer them as best as possible and make you as comfortable as possible. Dr. Klein is very trustworthy and knows what he’s doing. You’re in good hands if you see him. Ask a lot of questions! In my experience, you receive more information if you ask for it. Most doctors don't offer every point of detail but Dr. Sekhon will certainly take the time to explain the way things work if you show that you're interested and want to understand.Make sure to have a notebook ready with questions you have for the initial consultation.If you are looking for an empathetic doctor who is willing and able to listen, explore other options.Trust him and his team. They know what they are doing. He is extremely intelligent and will give you good advice based on research and up to date knowledge on fertility practice, so do not hesitate to ask any questions you have.Consider choosing a more scholarly, engaged and empathetic Provider. Dr. Thornton is none of these.Trust him. If you have questions don’t hesitate to ask as he is very open and responsive to answering them. She is great within RMA, but RMA has a million patients.  If you are meeting the standard protocol, she is great, but may be less so with special cases. Come prepared with your questions and concerns. Make sure, to be honest, that way she can give you the best course of treatment. And if it's a quick monitoring appointment, don't hesitate to stop her before she leaves the room to ask/express any concerns. Allow her to explain her rationale for various treatment approaches, and remember to ask all questions.  She feels like a wealth of knowledge, and when you ask questions, she can provide you with so much reassurance with her treatment decisions.Visit the downtown office in Soho if you want to see her. You need to actively email her and set up a call to really gain clarity.CHOOSE DR. FLISSER! I can’t imagine there being a better doctor for IVF (or fertility treatment more generally).If you are under 35-year old, lucky and healthy, it might be OK to work with Dr. Thornton. If you are older and cannot waste your time, do not work with her. Her one-way,  broad-brush approach does not suit a patient with special medical conditions. Ask questions if he speaks too quickly or goes too fast -- I think sometimes he forgets it's new information to his patients but any time I've asked him to clarify or re-explain it's been no problem. Ask for odds. The guy has an encyclopedic knowledge of how this works. We found knowing that one part of the process was less certain than others helped us manage expectations. Don't bother... find another doctor.Ask all the questions- she’s not going to offer up the info if you don’t. Push back if something doesn’t feel right or clear to you. She is better over the phone than via email. see previous, ask questions, ask why not. Do research on your own and come with specific questions you want answered, and don’t be shy to jump in and ask them. Otherwise he will just do his spiel. Don’t expect to see him more than once or twice, but the whole team at RMA is nice and supportive so you’re in good hands! Do some research - as people what questions you should ask her. Have all of your questions listed in advance. Do not be afraid to speak up for yourself (by asking questions and advocating for what you want).Not to expect to see her at every appointment.You'll have a wonderful experience with this doctor!Be completely open and honest with her. Tell her all the supplements you are taking, she will tell you which ones you actually need, unlike many who say you don't need to take anything. Ask her lots of questions in general. She will answer them all even if they seem ridiculous. One piece of advice, don't expect him to be the only doctor that you meet with at RMA of NY. I have had at least 4 different doctors perform my IUIs (I've had 5 to-date).Be prepared before your consult, but I think that applies to all doctor consults in this process. There are so many talented doctors in NY, you have to trust your intuition. he is a grown up and won't give you false hope, but you REALLY need to push hard and advocate for yourself if you want time and input from him.If you're looking for someone who is overly emotive or compassionate, he may not be for you. But he is a kind person and I felt that he was paying attention to me as a patient. Which is what mattered to me.Utilize his email. The process of infertility treatments can mess with your head, so use his email when you have questions or concerns about any aspect of what's going on.Don't expect to see him for monitoring or egg retrieval.  Also if you are someone who does a lot of research and wants to be very informed consider someone else.  If you want to not do a lot of research on your own and want follow the recommendations of a confident competent doctor, consider him. Expect efficiency. It may seems like he’s rushing at times, but if you have questions and concerns, he’ll answer them thoroughly. If you think of something later, he’s very reachable. Write everything down, and ask him to repeat himself - he talks fast! Ask lots of questions.I personally thought that i would meet with MD herself. When entering the room, she introduced us to a medical student. I was not informed about her and it honestly made the visit awkward and the student looked bored and made faces during the consult. I wish they would allow the patient to consent prior to the visit. I found it insensitive.Ask all the questions you have. He's very helpful and willing to spend time with you.Talk about the risks of multiple cycles to your body? Having had 8 cycles I do worry that I'd doing long term damage to myself. Also PGS - is it really really worth it? What if you're throwing away good embryos - what is the risk of that?Trust his plan of action! I was skeptical at first, but he knows what is best for every individual case!Don't be afraid to ask any questions. He is very open to answering questions and doesn't make you feel dumb.Prepare your questions ahead of time. Take the time to write down your questions. He will give you % of your chances for treatments just be prepared that it might not be what you expect.FInd another doctorI would not recommend that any prospective patients seek treatment with Dr. Grunfeld at RMA. I would recommend going to a different clinic.  I now see Dr. Samantha Pfeifer at Weil Cornel, and am having a much better experience.Take detailed notes, and ask for crystal clear steps / timelines. Do your homework, interrupt HIM- don't let him talk over you.  You must establish dominance or you will never be heard.  He will downplay your concerns about medication side effects.  He talks extremely quickly, gives you no time to process, and you'll be lucky if you even get to finish a sentence with him.  Be ready to learn a lot about it. He is very into genetics/diseases and will always push you to do as much testing as possible. 
He is available, professional and rational. You are your best advocate. Speak up if you have questions/concerns and educate yourself on your treatment options.Email is a good way to get ahold of her - the nurse can always connect you as well. She is forthright and will not sugar coat it - but does it warmly and with compassion. Don’t be afraid to communicate!Come prepared with questions and push for more details. I am someone who needs to know understand every bit of the process. Dr. Stein is very concise and gives just enough information. However, if you push a bit he gives more information. Don't go to him if you're older and have poor egg quality. He is of the philosophy that the more medicine, the better.  Come in prepared to ask questions! He is really smart and moves quickly, but if you have questions, he is really patient, thorough and informative. I never felt like he was rushing me out the door.I would say, do some research before going to the first appointment so you can ask all the questions you may have. Also, note that you may not see him during monitoring since the doctors rotate days to perform monitoring and retrieval but he is available if needed through the process. He is very direct...if that is off-putting, you may want to reconsider. I loved his blunt approach and his honesty. He also has a great sense of humor.Dr. Copperman is exceedingly more of a researcher than a warm and caring doctor. If you want warmth, compassion and a relationship, I’d go elsewhere.Focus on what's important which is being treated by a knowledgeable doctor who has a wealth of experience and knows what he is doing. Speak as much as possible, the more he knows the better he is able to treat you. Be an active participant in your medical care. Ask a lot of questions so that you feel informed of what the next steps are. Dr Copperman has alot of statistics and that helped me make decisions as to do IUI or IVF. In that way he is super helpful on what success rate of each procedure is. Dr Davis is a wonderful doctor with a great personality. At times I feel like a number, but that is due to the high number of patients that visit his office. There are only 2 doctors at his location, and at times there are a 10 or more patients in the waiting room during monitoring hours. I think that is just a testament to what a good practice it is, and it does not hinder me in any way from going there. I believe I am receiving the best care at RMA. I think if you want to be educated about your care by a doctor that you like as a person, than Dr. Davis is a good fit for you.Have your questions ready to ask her . She is very quick to answer questions .She recently moved Be a partner in your care; ask questions and be informed about your care.Don’t feel like you are burdening him with questions or concerns - voice them. He will never make you feel like you are a burden and will listen and take what you are saying seriously and into consideration. Definitely only see her at the Downtown office, it’s so much calmer and more pleasant. She goes back and forth between it and RMA East, but RMA East is SO much busier. Take your time when she is in the room with you. Even if you have a failed IUI, press to see her or speak to the nurse for a better course of action on the next round. Do your own research and ask as many questions as you can at your initial consultation and all throughout the process. You have to be your own advocate.You are in good hands with dr lederman- id say to remain positive and hopeful that the process no matter how long or disappointing or frustrating it may be will work Be sure to ask all your questions and not let him make you feel rushed and shy -- also, bring your partner when possible as I found that my partner was more assertive and not shy when asking questions, whereas I was. It was good also to have my partner there to make sure I didn't forget to ask anything. Have your questions written out in advance on your phone or wherever so you don't forget anything. I do remember once when I needed a signature from a doctor about getting physical therapy for my shoulders continued that he was happy to help me, and I do appreciate that. Also, he helped expedite my getting all my medical records, especially after my failed embryo freezing cycle.Ask any and all questions you have. If you feel strongly about one path or another, he's open to hearing that feedback. Make sure you take control of your body and allow him or his staff to explain everything to you. Do not take ""NO"" for an answerI would get a second opinion. Educated yourself more on the IVF topic.  I was abit overwhelmed and clueless.   To make sure you ask every question you have, as she doesn't really give answers unless you come with questions. Be your own advocate, and push him hard if you disagree. Schedule specific appointments if you want to have time to ask questions. Ask questions and ask him to slow down if he is speaking too quickly. As Dr. Davis to ensure that you care is known across all members of the RMA team. Let him do his job as an RE and build a support system of friends for the emotional support that you will certainly need. I’d give this advice regardless of who the fertility doctor is, and that is: If a cycle doesn’t work the first time don’t switch doctors just because it didn’t work.  I think they are putting together a puzzle and the first time is only one piece.  Unfortunately, I think people have to shift expectations of fertility treatments being a perfect science.  It most definitely is not.  Dr. Flisser very clearly understands the percentages and numbers and it was comforting and helpful as we dug in towards additional treatments that he could share the true chances of success.Don't waste you time. I never felt better than when I went to two separate opinions after and they both said WTF was he doing. I would give the same advice for someone seeing any doctor and that would be write all your questions and concerns down.  This way you are prepared when you see him.No matter how small your concern is, ask questions to him or the team directly rather than searching it over the internet. Stay on top of your care and ask questions if you do or know why is happening or why it is happening. Research on your own and stay informed of proper protocol. Check and recheck all of the suggested methods. make sure to ask questions; he is open to answering any questions that may arise. Listen to him. He is up to date on the medical literature and does what he knows is medically necessary and no more to put you at minimal risk and maximum chance of success. Don't be afraid to ask questions. He and his staff are happy to explain everything and make you feel like they are recommending the best path forward. Find another doctor.If you see that the treatment is not going as planned, schedule a conversation with Dr. Sandler to discuss alternative options.Ask a lot of questions. Find out as much as you can about treatments before seeing him. Take it upon yourself to get educated as he is very relaxed and doesn't seem to think need fertility help is as traumatic to patients as it can be.I don't think I have advice, I would just recommend her to others.Ask him how often you will see him, how he will determine your course of treatment, what will be the next steps if the current treatment fails, and then decide if it is going to be a good fit for your needs and expectations. I would tell the prospective patient to ask a lot of questions upfront, esp. in case the first couple of treatments fail. I think the most time you'll get out of the doctor is upfront during the first consultation. After the first meeting, you are dealing with nurses and other doctors in the clinic who are not your primary doctor so it's harder to get the information you are looking for.You're in good hands. Don't be afraid to ask questions and always be your own advocateDon't be afraid to ask questions, and to reach out if there's something you want to discuss. It's a big clinic, so it may feel like you aren't getting personal attention. But I always got responses to my calls or emails usually on the same day or the day after. It is important to be proactive throughout your treatment and engage the doctor as much as possible. Dr. Mukherjee will answer your questions and doubts, so make sure that you ask all questions you have and that you effectively communicate specific issues that aren't fully clear/or that you would like to learn more about.   Be proactive but trust his judgment! Ask all your questions at your initial consult or email him directly if you aren’t getting the answers from the nursing team or from him during monitoring sessions.
Appeal and request his attendance at procedures directly to Dr Copperman and also have the nursing team note he request so it’s in the system as well. Ask questions. He'll answer them all.If you want someone who's going to coddle you, he's not for you. He's busy, and has lots of patients. Don't expect him to hold your hand or give you emotional comfort. But if you want results, he is the one to go to. I trust him and his medical opinion completely.Trust himOne piece of advice is have your questions ready. He is willing to answer everything truthfully and take the time to spend with you.  If you dont have anything to ask dont expect him to sit with you for hours. However take advantage of emailing him. Sometimes I have forgotten to ask something and shoot him a quick email and he ALWAYS responds.Go see him today!  Don't wait.  I truly believe he is the best IVF doctor and has the best lab, clinic and team.Know your body and what you need. To be your own advocate because he does not look at everything and important testing numbers get neglected. Be careful if he is overly optimistic. IVF is not a fail-safe. Dr. Grunfeld will make it seem like it is. You will not be handheld, and you may have to ask for specifics at some points, but feel confident that he will get the job done.Ask a lot of questions.  You have to be proactive to get information.  Know that you may not have him for your retrieval.  This is more a statement of the clinic though because each doctor is scheduled to do retrievals on a certain day.  Don't be embarrassed to ask questions, because he is always willing to answer and explain. Please seriously consider Dr. Stein (as long as insurance and location works out for you) - you will be in good hands,Ask a lot of questions. Be in touch via email if you want more information. Don't be afraid to ask him questions. He sees a lot of patients and can be very quick during a monitoring appointments and can make it hard to get your questions asked and it can feel a little rushed. This is hard. You don't know what you don't know, so it's impossible to tell someone to ask a lot of questions, etc. when you don't know what to ask and you feel like you're getting thorough information. Don't be shy to ask questions. He's fairly patient with this, but sometimes won't think to have us try a certain thing until we bring it up. For example we did two egg retrievals and only the second one brought us normal embryos (genetically tested). He assumed we were going to do a frozen transfer the next cycle. We thought about it, and then asked if it would make sense to do another egg retrieval and try to bank a few more genetically normal embryos before the transfer. (We had several reasons for this). He said that was a great idea, and he recommended highly that we do it, if we were up for it - but he didn't suggest it himself - we brought the subject up to him. Don't expect warm and fuzzy.Trust her, you’re in good hands. Although, with any doctor, make sure you ask questions if you don’t understand something and advocate for yourself. Push hard. They will whisk you through if you don't demand answers and work really hard to understand and push for the best treatment. Run for the door.Similar to any fertility appointment I found that I often quickly forgot details after I left the office or hung up the phone. I learned to take notes during appointments, also to write down any questions in advance. Ask him questions, and challenge his responses if you are unhappy with them.Don't be afraid to ask anything! She is totally nonjudgmental and always responded to all my questions (some of which were kind of crazy!) with patience, compassion and clarity.See multiple doctors before making your decision, and be sure to press her on questions you have related to your specific case. Ask how she plans to vary her treatment plans based on the particulars of your situation.Don't be afraid to ask questions because he will answer them.change doctors. he's set in his ways and impersonal.Ask how many times you'll have contact with him during the course of your care.  I would advise you to ask questions about the process.  Fertility doctors go through these procedures 100s of times a day and often forget that we as patients don't know the process and have fears (not to mention that the meds we're on make us an emotional wreck)   If you have questions or concerns, speak up and ask.  Due to the nature of the practice, there is always a ton of people in office and the actual monitoring is very quick, so it sometimes feels rushed, but if you have questions and concerns and ask, Flisser will stop and take the time to answer them thoughtfully.   Leave RMA quickly unless you have really simple problems. My friends whose only infertility issues involved low sperm count did well with RMA. Others with DOR and other diagnoses really found better results elsewhere.Be willing to ask questions, and try new protocols if the first one doesn't workDo a lot of research beforehand and if you have a question in the moment ask it, don't wait for it to be answered, especially if you think what he said was ambiguous or contradictory or anything like that. If you think of a question after you leave the office, call the office or email Dr Mukherjee right away, don't wonder or wait until your next appointment. He responds well to challenges. And besides, you're likely paying good money for this, so get your money's worth. I found Dr. Ledderman to be just the kind of fertility doctor that I needed.  I think that if you are up front with him and tell him what you are looking for, he will be honest with you and try and help you achieve your goals.Trust him!  It's really hard to give away 100% control of this journey to conceive, but giving the doctor your trust is the first step.  Also, having a ""list"" of questions/concerns ready in your head to discuss (aka be prepared as much as possible) helps.  As everyone knows, doctors are all very busy and doing this will help ensure all will be addressed.Ask questions and don't be shy!!To spend more in depth time.  Be open friendly and even if busy, give them a sense that you are with them in the moment and they aren't just a number.Know that he is not super lovey dovey.  He can be very straight forward and factual at times, so if you want someone who is a little more emotional, he is not your guy.Listen to what she says - she knows what she is talking about and won't beat around the bush.  If you have to see other doctors make sure you have her cell phone number in case something goes wrong when you are not with her.he is a clinician first with a high volume practice.  you will get pregnant there but he won't be your best friend.  Just talk to them about privacy if that's a concern for you, and ask questions about any medical concerns so you know if you need to see another specialist as well.Ask him all the questions you want so that you can fully understand him and the process.Have your questions ready. Know and write your ""infertility story/journey"" so you have something to refer to during consultations.  Go in with an open mind and manage your expectations.If you're going to RMA, I would find a more experienced doctor.RMA is very busy. It can be a little overwhelming when you go in for monitoring. If you have questions make sure you call, or email your nurse.  Dr. Mukherjee will get back to you. He's never impatient and has the most wonderful bedside manner. I feel so fortunate to have had him as my doctor throughout this journey. To not be afraid to act direct questions and follow up if the answers aren't as thorough as you'd like them to be.Trust him and ask him as many questions you have.Go to someone else at RMA.Ask what to expect. Don't be afraid of being proactive:  and be specific with questions to take advantage of his knowledge. Joan straight to the point Don’t expect sensitivity all the time - he is not the most socially aware person. Nothing in particularAsk a lot of questions and demand to get answers before you leave. Don’t be afraid to ask questions. She will always be willing to answer them. If you have questions, continue to ask them. He can be responsive by email. If not, his office will set up a phone consult. 

He is direct and extremely knowledgeable, but I am not sure how much he thinks outside the box. Know the limits and rules of the clinic.Trust his plan for you. He has your best interest at heart.She's a good RE, but I don't know how well she would handle complicated cases.  Partly, that hesitation is because we didn't have a complicated case, but nevertheless, if I had an out of the box diagnosis, I might have gone elsewhere.If you do not get pregnant after a couple of IVFs either change doctor or change clinics.He's a good guy who is caring and passionate about helping people get pregnant. Be prepared to ask question if/when you have face time with Dr. Sandler.  He is impossible to get a hold of and speak to after your initial consultation and meeting.Don't be afraid to ask as many questions as possible. He's a great doctor! Be prepared that RMA can feel like a factory, but don't let that cloud your experience. Mukherjee himself is a renowned and competent dr. You're in good hands. Draw your own conclusion and try not to get persuaded by doctor's opinion. Dr. Sandler is amazing. Be patient with the size of the practice. He is worth the wait.to make sure you fully understand the expectations of the cycle proposed do your research and fight for what you want and believe.Don't be afraid to ask questions. Dr Knopman will answer them and will partner with you to find the best course of treatment.Trust him - you're in excellent hands.Follow up on everything dont take anything for face valueShe talks fast, but there's a ton of information packed in there.  She was no longer at RMA when I went back for my second child, but if I'd had any challenges, I would have followed her to CCRM.  Absolutely and unequivocally.  He is not going to hold your hand, but he will do whatever he can to get the best otucome.Just be honest with him and ask any questions you have. He will answer everything. There will be a litany of tests and schedule any conversations ahead of time and not during the prime morning hours if you can help it. He will tell you everything including things you may not want to hear.Ask a lot of questions about your options.  The nurses are your friends, and the doctors do not generally have a lot of compassion.Not to use her.Expect good results but not a lot of hand holding and warm cozy feelings. They run a very efficient factory with high ratings but not touchy-feely. I would say demand the attention.  Ask for sit-downs with the doctor before and after treatment. Do your research and homework. Don't be afraid to ask questions. She gives a lot of information, which is helpful, but can sometimes be overwhelming in the moment. You might have to be flexible and go to NYC and see other doctors but they are all great. Dr Flisser tries to see you whenever possible and always knows what is going on when you are with the other doctors in the practice. If you’re looking for bluntness and don’t care as much about bedside manner, he is for you. Communicate with her directly if necessary. Her staff may not be as receptive as she is.Trust him and reach out whenever you need. He knows what he is doing trust him completely. If your looking for a doctor who will not sugar coat things, this is the doctor you want. Bring your partner to your first visit.  You will get a lot of information which is overwhelming and you will meet with various members of the team.  He's a great, well-known doctor with a lot of experience.It's a busy office, come with your questions and do your research.  It will help you get better answers from the doctors and staff.To see him.I think you just always need to be prepared to ask questions. Dr. Flisser was thorough and informative. You need to proactively make appointments when you want to regroup and discuss options ptherwise all communication was with the staff. Ask questions during your visitsMake your appointment way in advance. It’s sometimes hard to get a quick appointment. Not warm, see someone elseDo intermediate check ins with patience, propose scheduling time to discuss. Offer all the options that RMA has, nutritionist etc, since the beginning. So people can feel that there is a support system behind the doctor.Trust his experience and if you need something more, ask.  He listens. Don't expect to see him at each appointment, but if you need to talk to him, he will certainly make time for a visit.Expect blunt communication. He doesn't beat around the bush. BUT he is honest and does everything in his power to help you  achieve your goalEmail him if you want answers to any questions. He's very prompt!Be proactive and push communicationDo your research, ask questions, and do not take the first suggestion as the oracle. Schedule your egg freezing cycle when you don't have anything else going on. The hormones can make your emotions go nuts. Email him - he's very responsive. If you're not a fan of the blunt reality of your situation, he's not your guy. Ask her questions, see if she's taking due care in fully addressing your concerns and clarifying medical jargon. Also ask how involved she will be in future visits and procedures.Ask as many questions as you can.  He can be very clinical, so you may have to ask him to explain things in a more simple way.  Just know that you can ask him anything at anytime and he will get back to you, even when he is on vacation.Feel free to ask questions -- she is more than happy to answer in a way you will understand and feel empowered!Be communicative with Dr.McAvey regarding your care. She helped me when the clinic failed me. I appreciated her involvement. Communicate often with the nurse coordinators because they are the ones who will answer your questions directly. If you're not getting the answers you want to hear, you'll have to press hard to speak with the doctor. Or else make an appointment to see him for a face to face consultation. He is kind but brief.  You have to be willing to trust what he says and not want to be coddled. Definitely take advantage of your time with her. Prep any questions before hand. I did not have a good experience with him and if I had it to do over I would not go to RMA if it meant he would be the one to do my procedure.  For elective surgeries that can't be totally planned timing-wise I'd want to be comfortable with every doctor in the practice.Be an advocate for yourself always and make sure you do your own research. You know yourself best and fight for what you want. Email him any questions or concerns and also meet with him not during the morning rush to discuss treatment plans. We met with him each cycle and he spent an hour with us each time once on a Friday night he stayed extra late to answer all of our questions and we closed the office with him. He always called us to answer questions after we were upset with the results of a cycle during his family vacation and you could hear the kids in the background. He really tried to be available and you could tell. Go in with an open mind! At the beginning he seems too nice that you don't know if should entirely believe him or if he is trying to overly convince you. But once you ask questions and realize he is very transparent and treats you with respect I trusted all his recommendations because he truly cares about his patients He is very direct, and may not hold your hand as others, being a foreign physician (he was born out of the country) may have a different cultural background but showed genuine concern and has been known for not taking money out of people who have no chance to get pregnant.Be your own patient advocateWrite down all the questions you want to ask and either email them to her and her team or ask at your visit.   Do your research!Ask questions.  She can be very technical.Im not sure yet. He seems really nice but I havent gone through with the treatment yet. Be optimistic and confident in his abilities.Explicitly have her tell you the amount of eggs to be retrieved at every visit so you can have a chance to cancel before going in for retrieval. Hes very scientific he gives you his opinion and what he chooses for you.Do you research, ask lots of questions and be your own advocate.Dr. Thornton is great! Just avoid her staff if possible.Know your body and trust your intuition. Stay positive. You're not getting a warm and fuzzy doctor but you will get quality care Don't be afraid to be open about your questions and reservations. He'll help you understand anything that's not clear. Ask many questions and don't be afraid to email him. Be open minded and you are in great hands, if not the best hands..Good luck :)Ask all of the questions! Email him with outstanding questions, he's very responsive.Stay on top of your care It important to ask questions and be pro-active with your care. Be patient and trust the team Ask all of the questions! Don't feel bad about keeping him longer than you think you should. Don't expect to get to talk to him whenever you want.  At RMA, you see your Dr. occasionally but the nurses are really who you deal with the most.Don't be afraid to be open with her (hopes, fears). She will give you her full attention and will be totally honest.I think he is very good at what he does, he is very busy and has a lot of patients.He's the best doctor you'll ever have (now at Extend Fertility).  Go to him for sound medical guidance, but rely on someone else for emotional comfort. Trust Dr. Lederman! The process is scary and emotional, but he's amazing! He knows what he's doing, and is level headed. Don't expect him to always take a ton of time explaining things to you - you kind of have to trust  that he is a great re and he will do the best for you the patientKnow that you will be working with the whole team of doctors and you won't know who will be doing what procedure. Appreciate his straightforwardness. Not a ton of hand-holding but he did make me feel cared for and cared about.Share all your fears and hopes (re infertility issues)with Dr g. He'll put u at ease and will respond truthfully without giving false hope or unrealistic expectations albeit with a Healthy dose of hopeBe very clear about what you want, and ask specific questions.  You'll get specific answers.  Trust and communicate with your doctor. Dr Mukherjee was always willing to address and explain and concerns I had and change treatment if I wasn't comfortable. BE persistent with your care  He doesn’t monitor every day. If I did have a question about a morning visit he was good about getting back to me Ask lots of questions upfrontKnow that hes a great doctor with a high success rate but you will not get personalized attention.Don't expect warmth.Ask a lot of questions. Dr. Stein was willing to answer any question, but didn't necessarily offer all that information initially.You'll feel so comfortable there, don't worry about a thing!Be prepared for the worst news and be very patient. Infertility is a roller coaster and generally involves a long ride.He's a very good doctor; listen to his advice.push for ivf soonerGo to him!Listen to himDo research, ask a lot of questions! Go see herDon't expect good bedside manner, except good results. Be prepared to be inundated with information.  Make sure to come with your questions prepared because he will talk over you otherwise.  That being said, he always gives thorough answers to questions.  Be realistic and patient with the process. Ask questions. Be patientdont expect to see your doctor at every blood work or appointment. Dr Copperman did not do my extraction nor my implantation. Only go if you want IVFGo see him, he's great. Try and schedule your monitoring for days that he'll be there.Go into the process with an open mind, and try to stay calm and relaxed throughout the whole process as you are in the best hands.Go for it. He is a true expert on the field, and your potential children are too valuable to be trusted with someone who is just okMake sure to advocate for yourself. Do your research and ask about all possible options, don’t just do exactly what they tell you to do, find out why. You will be in good hands with Dr.Klein! If you’re looking for a specialist that will address your concerns, fears and cheer on your success Dr. Klein is the right doctor! Please be open to his suggestions and recommendations.Do your homework and ask lots of questions. Write your questions down if you need to and it’s always good to have someone else with you who can remember certain things you may not. She is very warm and kind and easy to talk to. Go in with all of your previous blood work and a list of questions. He’s very knowledgeable so ask him anything.He is kind and compassionate with a nice bedside manner.  I don't think there will be any radical protocols, but I don't know if that is a bad thing, but I trust him so I trust his opinion.Dr Stein is a great doctor have all your questions he’s makes sure it answered and make sure you understand what’s happening. Ask lots of questions. Dr. Flisser knows what he is doing and in the end was probably correct in his course of treatment however, I would have appreciated a little more understanding/compassion when I was feeling anxious, confused, etc.Don't take it personally if he doesn't remember you, he has a ton of patients.   But he has a ton of patients for a reason! Tell him about your goals and time frames, he will work to help you achieve themIf you're truly ready for the outcome that you've been pushing for, whether the end result is exactly what you envisioned at the start, a little or even a lot different, Dr. Copperman is your guy.I think it's important to choose a doctor who has been doing IVF for a long, long time and has a lot of experience. My previous doctor was younger and that transfer was not a success.don't expect to see the doctor for more than three minutes at a time as this practice is extremely busy. if you don't mind minimal interaction with your doctor, then this is the correct avenue, however, if you want to spend a substantial amount of time with your doctor at each visit and constantly need explanation as to each step then go with a doctor in a smaller practice He is honest and caring. A genuine person. He cares about the mother and wants to ensure a heathy mom before a healthy baby. Take good notes during your meetings with Dr. Stein, because RMA's paperwork isn't all that clear.If you're looking for a friendly, warm but very informative doctor, she is perfect.Tell him up front where your head is at with the process.  By being honest with him about how I felt and where my husband was with things, he was able to provide the appropriate information in a way that made us both feel really comfortable.  He's more soft spoken and not a huge ""talker"" but I always felt that I got what I needed from every appointment.If you are extremely easily offended, I wouldn't go to Dr. Stein. He can make comments that are 100% appropriate, but I could see how somebody with thin skin may misinterpret them. I know that fertility treatment is a time of high emotions, so there is a chance they could be misinterpreted. Trust Dr. Stein.  And do not be afraid to ask questions.  You have to be your own advocate.Don't be afraid to advocate for yourself and ask for what you need, while trusting you are in expert hands.I would say she is dependable, accessible and an amazing doctor. Trust Dr Stein and the entire staff at RMA. They are very professional and know what they are doing. Ask all of the questions you want and don't worry that you're taking up too much time; you aren't. He will answer all of your questions, and will tell you if he cannot.She asked if we wanted more than 1 child. We said yes. She then recommended for us to do IVF instead of IUI. Because by the time we would like to have another child, I would be older and have less eggs etc. So it made sense to freeze embryos for the future. Listen to the doctors recommendations, be an active/informed participant in the treatment (ask questions and know what methods might work holistically you help supplement the medical treatment) and stay positive.Dr Lederman will be straightforward with you. Do not expect him to go into details in others regards that are not medical ( like financial bills etc ). He is practical and honest. Go early to monitoring hours, especially if you are going to East Side.The shots are not painful.  I'm scared of needles and I could do them solo. He can give you a lot of information, write everything down! If you have any questions, just ask and he will explain in more detail.Trust the progress/ journey! It will happen.Be ready for working with a large practice and appreciate the benefits of Dr. Flisser being on a large team.",7.799999999999984,7.899999999999985,"RMA NY generally is a big, popular clinic that has a high volume of patients. Most doctors don't offer every point of detail but Dr. Sekhon will certainly take the time to explain the way things work if you show that you're interested and want to understand. Dr Davis is a wonderful doctor with a great personality. I think the most time you'll get out of the doctor is upfront during the first consultation. To be your own advocate because he does not look at everything and important testing numbers get neglected. This is more a statement of the clinic though because each doctor is scheduled to do retrievals on a certain day. Ask questions during your visitsMake your appointment way in advance. Schedule your egg freezing cycle when you don't have anything else going on. Share all your fears and hopes (re infertility issues)with Dr g. He'll put u at ease and will respond truthfully without giving false hope or unrealistic expectations albeit with a Healthy dose of hopeBe very clear about what you want, and ask specific questions."
23,RMA of New York,nurse,"Eliza went above and beyond in her care for me.  She even went out of her way to see me during my latest transfer.  She is a wonderful personal, and incredibly talented professionally.They remember your name and recognize you in the office.  It is quite remarkable given the number of patients they see each day.  Also considering that we are a same-sex couple, we did not feel judged at all.LOVED Arielle, she was amazing to work with, super responsive, incredibly caring, and an overall wonderful person.All the nursing staff and coordinators were fantastic. Our experience at RMA was really good. They all explained everything thoroughly and were caring and professional. Nurse always answered phone calls took few days to get an answer via email. Nurse was patient and caring The coordinator was helpful in explaining next steps and keeping me organized with the paperwork. Having a point person in the clinic was great.Dr Flisser's nurse coordinator, made herself available from the first visit. She gave her work email, and explained the process if I had any questions. I actually had to email her about a question on a saturday and I got a call from her same day. It calmed my anxieties since I was on vacation and traveling. She was efficient and answered all my concerns. The coordinators do cc: others with your care so that one of them will email back.First time around they were amazing; I cried when I said goodbye to our primary nurse as I transitioned to the OB. This time, my IVF coordinator is fantastic, but I have talked to a different nurse each time and it doesn't feel as warm.We were assigned a specific team that worked with Dr. Davis. The nurses were responsive when I called or emailed with questions. They provided clear directions for administering medications and next steps. I do wish they had spent time showing us how to do the injections rather than watching videos. They were very knowledgeable and very prompt at returning calls and answering any concerns we had i a very timely manner.Rebecca was awesome. Also direct, but cares about her patients and communicated my results always in a timely manner.Kind and friendly. There wasn't very much communication or extra information given for a first timer who knows nothing about what to avoid during those few weeks once you get pregnant etc. And the fact that I wasn't seen by the same doctor every time was not mentioned. Eliza was completely professional, available, helpful, and caring. The staff and their coordination throughout the process were great. We loved the team at RMA.The nurse was my least favorite part of the treatment. I had an accident while I was on the treatment and called her with a concern of having lost the baby, but she showed zero emotions. I wasn't expecting her to support me as if I was her best friend, but I would've appreciated more reassurance that my baby could be fine... enough reassurance to calm me up until my next doctor visit.The nurses I had were very informative and sensitive to your needs. They made you feel at ease. Primary PA was easy to reach and quick to answer questions when she was at work.  If she was out, I got calls with results from nursing staff I had never met.AMAZING! Very patient, compassionate, caring. They took the time to answer my questions, no matter how many times I asked. Dr. Thorntons whole team was awesome. Clarissa did all the paperwork and was very organized and on top of her stuff. Kayla did fiances and really knew her stuff. We were self pay, and she helped us figure out of there was any way to cut some costs or make it a little lighter. Melissa is the IVF nurse and not only called with all my protocol, but would also immediately follow up with an email. When I got pregnant, I experienced a lot of spotting. Melissa was awesome about answering me by email or phone, and made sure all my neurotic questions were answered and me and baby were safe. Jordyn was very helpful, responsive and knowledgable. I found working with her really wonderful. I was assigned a coordinator of Dr. Copperman. She was lovely and very helpful and communicative, but because I was never given contact info for Dr. Copperman, she was a poor substitute in the moments when I really needed to speak to my doctor. Also, the nursing team in general had terrible bedside manner. When all our embryos failed after an egg retrieval, a nurse left me a voicemail on a Saturday morning to inform me. When I called back, I was told she didn't think Dr. Copperman could speak to me until Monday. I only got a call back from Dr. Copperman after expressing the fact that that was an unacceptable response. There's a real lack of care towards patients here that is felt especially when the news is bad. There was a lack  of communication between staff. My primary nurse was hard to get in contact didn’t have her direct line or email. They changed my care coordinator 3 times with out even telling me. I also got complete misinformation regarding which perscriptions were covered/not covered. They also referred me to a pharmacy that charged me 3 times the amount Walgreens charged. The care coordinator gave me complete misinformation which made the process more confusing, frustrating, and stressful!I found all of the nurses at RMA to be great, but Dr. Sandler's nurses Danielle and Alyssa and beyond fantastic. They always reassured me and helped me through every step of the process. They were approachable, and if I called RMA about something specific, the nurses would call me back ASAP, often within the hour. Based on my prior experience within medical offices, RMA is unparalleled as far as sensitivity, efficiency, compassion, and overall excellence in general. I am so grateful that I was recommended to RMA, and the nurses in particular made the experience as pleasant as possible. I am forever grateful to Danielle and Alyssa for their expertise, kindness, and compassion. Overall, very easy to get in touch with as I had several questions along the way. Email was best for me and them. Phone calls were fine, too, sometimes had to wait for a call back, obviously. Eliza, the primary nurse I worked with, responded to emails and calls the same day, usually within a few hours. She talked me down when I got anxious, and helped with scheduling follow ups during my pregnancy when I was also dealing with my mother's terminal illness. 
The clinical nurses who did blood draws and other tests during monitoring were fantastic. I'm very bad with having blood taken (get nauseous, woozy), and they got me through it quickly and without getting sick, and didn't make me feel rushed if I needed a few extra minutes to recover.She was very easily accessible via email (and I emailed a lot!).  She was very patient and answered ALL my questions.  She took the time to get to know us but yet keep a professional demeanor.  I liked everyone we saw at RMA!  Everyone was very pleasant in the mornings and made the monitoring process pretty seamless.  The nurses who worked on the retrieval / transfer floor were amazing!  They were very sweet and patient.  I felt very well cared for when we were there.The staff was fantastic.  Theyare responsive, helpful, and suportive.  They call you back quickly.  I once called with basic ally a very emotional question and when I apologized for calling with such, the nurse said this was part of her job and really calmed me down.  They also helped with prescriptions and referrals very quickly.  Dr. Grunfeld had mentioned seeing an endocrinologist for a thyroid issue.  That doctor did not take my insurance.  When I asked the coordinator, she told me not to spend out of pocket money for that and helped me find another in network doctor with whom I was very happy.The nurses were always there to answer any questions. The called back in a timely manner and were very compassionate.I spoke with multiple nurses and each time the person knew exactly what I needed to do next and was able to guide me in the process, but don't expect a ""buddy"" throughout this. They have a large staff and they rotate around. Leyla was wonderful throughout the process.  She was full of information and so thoughtful and caring.  Keri was the nurse I worked with primarily in between my first series of IVF when I had twins and when I went back for a singleton embryo transfer. She was unbelievable. She left for med school which was very sad for me, but she made me feel empowered, confident, comfortable and supported. I adored herfelt they tried to make it as bearable as possible- patient, took time to make sure you understood everything. Gave us medication from own supply when we had run out -, organized. The nursing staff and coordinator are patient and answer all your questions in a timely and detailed manner.  They help you figure out every step of the process and will return your calls or emails very quickly.Both assigned nurses were great.  They explained the medication side effects and answered all questions.  On the occasion that a different nurse called I had mixed experiences.  One gave misinformation about the embryo stage another forgot something I mentioned to her.  Overall the two primary were exceptional the others were just ok.Both the nurse and coordinator were extremely responsive either by phone or email.  Throughout my time at RMA I always knew I would hear results or get my questions answered immediately. Nurses called back shortly after leaving a message at the front desk. Some were more compassionate than others. The coordinator assigned to us was great!The nurse was wonderful! Super warm and responsive. The nurse who called me with my results/instructions was always warm, informative and a clear communicator.  My coordinator answered emails promptly and thoroughly.  I felt they were disorganized and some of them were just rude.The nurses were good. Got to know them by first name. Loved all the staff. Primary nurse (Clara) was good and always contacted me. My IVF coordinator was useless. Very patient, reassuring, kind, went out of her way to make my journey as easy as possibleJordyn was a life saver.  She helped me
Through the hardest times in my cycle.  She was compassionate and very kind to me and my husband.  She even helped me deal with the financial team when needed.  She was/is amazing.  They had so many patients that they seemed to have trouble distinguishing patients and histories. There is also a large and varied staff; some nurses are far more compassionate and pleasant than others.They were always so kind and warm. It was one of the scariest times in my life, and they were all so compassionate!Dr c always has a couple of nurses who are your primary nurses and know your whole history and treatment. They are your support system too. That makes Rma unique (some clinics are not like that) and one of the best things about them Keri was amazing. She was so friendly and clear and made us feel safe. She was great at giving bad news and clearly took pleasure in giving good news. It really felt like she cared. Available and caringIntelligenceThe third party team at RMA New York is exceptional.  Everyone who touched our case was super organized, compassionate and truly rooting for our success.The nurses were always smiling, had a cheery tone when calling with updates, and were very easy to get in touch with on the phone or via email.  They were definitely what made our almost daily trips at some points pleasant and manageable.All very professional, caring and responsive. Highly recommend.My care coordinator, Sam was the most supportive, amazing, incredibly hilarious human being ever. She and I became girlfriends. My nurse coordinator Jordyn was a dream to work with. She was always on top of everything and spent the time to sit with me and explain my protocol as well as provide me with injection instructions and tips. Both Sam and Jordyn went above and beyond for me. They're both my fertility fairy God Mothers. The IVF coordinator I worked with - Kiran - is/was lovely. She's quick to respond over email, call, etc, and always had a great disposition, even when unmatched by mine. My only frustration came from the coordination between Kiran, the nurses, doctor, and 3rd party reproduction team a few times. Because there are so many cooks in the kitchen, communication failed a few times. IE, I was told that I'd be starting another cycle in April this spring, and learned (quite late) that it wouldn't be able to take place until May. This wouldn't have bothered me except that no one really told me - I had to find out myself. All a result of each team member thinking that someone else was going to tell me. I don't think this would be a problem for most, but if you're using a GC, you'll have to work with 3rd party repro and IVF, and those two need to communicate just a little bit better.All of the nurses and admin at RMA are very warm and calm.  I always felt completely focused on that cared for.Courtney was very helpful during our ivf treatment. She responds promptly and alway very pleasant to talk to. She is knowledgeable and very good at her job. Ariel is also very nice and caring. My IVF coordinator and the entire nursing staff is so wonderful!  I started this treatment scared to give blood, I would faint, and everyone was so nice about it and I no longer pass out.  They are all really nice and work hard to make the visits go smoothly.  My coordinator was always reaching out to meet or just talk and was available when I needed something.  After initial communication problems with my first IVF coordinator who left early in my treatment, the nursing staff and subsequent IVF coordinators were simply fantastic.  From making blood draws pleasant to getting blood work and treatment results, the nurses and coordinators are helpful, kind, and compassionate.  Everyone in the office was amazing and great. Very friendly, informative and always explained things clearlyI adore Connie -- she was there for us every step of the way. I looked forward to her calls every day after monitoring and she answered all of my crazy questions and emails kindly and thoughtfully. Her care and compassion made the entire process so much better!The Nursing staff was friendly and understood my wife had an aversion to needles. My care coordinator was awesome. She always let me know when she was available and out of the office with automatic messages. Every time i had a question or concern she would either call me or send me an email. to emails she responded from 30 minutes to less than 24 hours depending on the time of day the message was sent. The nurses always had smiles and were very professional.They were AMAZING! They are so friendly and communicative. Always call you the same day as your bloodwork and explain everything. They are wonderful!!Great staff and very prompt in calling back with test results Olga is the nurse practitioner of the office. She is not as warm as the rest of the staff, but she is very professional. She's thorough when she explains things and always called me after my appointments to make sure I was aware of the new meds or the time to take my trigger shot, and to let me know she sent my prescriptions in a timely manner. All of the nurses were great. They promptly called me every morning or early afternoon with my results and instructions and took the time to carefully explain everything and answer any questions I had.The nurse plays a key role in IVF and IUI procedure. Melissa tends to ignore emails and has never clearly explained the procedure. She fails to communicate all of my test results or check my records. When she is on vacation, no one coves her duty. Things can easily fall through cracks. It is nerve-breaking to work with her.Every single nurse on Dr. Copperman's team has been fantastic. Jordyn Banks was the first person we met with and has been there at every step of the way - even giving me her cellphone number in case we had any urgent questions/concerns after hours. Samantha M is our IVF coordinator and was so detailed and organized from the get go and responds to e-mails immediately. I always felt like they were on top of everything at every turn. The phlebotomist is really great at RMA! Also shoutout to Nurse Melissa who is lovely and often went above and beyond. I felt she explained things to me in a way doctor Sekhon was not capable of and always showed compassion. The coordinator, Jennifer, is sweet and was helpful but definitely inexperienced. RMA uses a lot of staff to get in touch with their many patients - they do calls in the afternoon and leave voice mail messages and emails with instructions. Nurses are nice and very diligent; they follow up with the doctor and the coordinator if needed. Some are better  (Katrina?) than the others, but overall they are nice, Olga is cold, disorganized, provides inconsistent instructions to Dr. McAvey and Anna (for instance, she will say you have to take a HPT on Thursday instead of on Wednesday, she sometimes says incorrect medication dosage, she's not personable). In contrast, I saw Anna less frequently but she was always much more friendly and her instructions were more in line with Dr. McAvey.The nurse was fine.  Doesn't give me as much detail on the follicle growth as the doctors do and isn't as personable, but she's fine otherwise.  The IVF coordinator has been patient with me and answers all my questions in a timely manner.  The ladies at the front desk have all been pleasant.  The nurse who does my blood draws has been very pleasant with me.All the nurses and care coordinators were truly.  I mostly worked with Julie, who is wonderful - always responsive, compassionate, understanding, always had time for an extra chat and was ready to share additional views and advice.The nurses on Dr Sekhon's staff are great. They always call you right back. They are very informed and answers questions with ease. I felt like the entire office runs more like a factory than a doctor's office. When being contacted by phone, it just is a list of things for me to do. Most of the time, things that did not work out, such as where to pick up my medication or timeliness of them putting the medication into the pharmacy. Some of the nurses seemed ok but you don't get an opportunity to know any of them well enough to build a trusting relationship. the nurses were really human, compassionate, and clear communicators.  I really liked them and felt like they knew me. 

my ivf coordinator was lovely - but young - because she was there to help with scheduling and not medical advice, the role she could play was pretty limited. We had an interesting time with coordinators because our first went out on medical leave in the middle of our retrieval cycle and no one told us. I had to email Dr. Klein to figure out why she hadn't emailed me back. I do not know the details of her leave, so I empathize that emergencies do happen, but I wish there had been better communication about it. 
The nursing staff overall were very nice. Because of my personal history with disordered eating and weight preoccupation, I do not like to know my weight when it is taken at the clinic. I asked to not be told,  but the nurse thought it was a joke and was very lighthearted about it. I wish they had been a little more sensitive to what I was asking.Marlene is friendly, warm, and thorough. I know she is good at what she does and I feel like I’m in good hands. The organisation at the clinic is first rate and really makes a difference as the questions and pressure is taken offMartha was very caring and supportive during my IVF journey. She was very motherly to me and showed a great deal of compassion during the good and trying times during the IVF process. She provided a lot of encouragement and valuable information!I had an amazing primary nurse, Julie. She is such a hard worker, very compassionate, communicates well (phone & email). I don't feel rushed when talking to the phone with her. She would even answer her email even if she is off! (this shows dedication to her patients & work). The rest of the nursing staff is also great! I really love the nurses at RMA of NY. My IVF coordinator is also nice. She made sure she had everything before starting my cycle. At the Eastside clinic, they wouldn't have recognized me out of a crowd as a patient.  They were just doing their jobs, but they remembered nothing about my past experiences (miscarriage, the fact that I was depressed about failed IUIs, etc.) and would sometimes make insensitive comments during appointments.  I reached my limit when I tried to look at my partner's semen analysis pre-IUI and the nurse purposely covered it with her hand and moved it away from me for no apparent reason (perhaps because we didn't pay for a standalone SA?).  I complained about this experience and RMA reached out to apologize.Everyone at RMA of NY has always been very friendly and caring. 
The main nurse I communicate with is Eliza and she's been amazing! Answering every question, email, calls, ready to see me anytime.
She has great advice and genially cares. 
The IVF coordinator was Julia and she was also great in helping me get set-up and organize the meds process, and payment etc. Strengths: Staff are very prompt in responding to questions via email or phone. Weaknesses: Lack of coordination and multiple follow up emails/calls needed for the same question. Not always supportive/compassionate.While there was some lapses in communication, overall they were responsive, fast to respond to inquiry - and if they needed to check with the doctor they got back to me as soon as possible. This is at the RMA of BK. The staff and nursing staff at the main RMA - were less helpful. The coordinator was helpful is describing the next steps. She provided me with all her available contact information which was comforting.Leyla and Jordyn were awesome! I think they both sensed how nervous I was so they always called w/ my results within a few hours of my morning visits. I often wrote them emails with questions about my results or symptoms I was experiencing, and they both wrote back immediately everything - they were very helpful and reassuring. Both were a really calming influence and amazing resource during my time at RMA.Julia, the coordinator was great. Always available and an excellent main point of contact for questions or to reach out to other members of the team. Erin and Martha are two of Dr. Lederman's nurses and they were always kind, answered any questions and gave you a call with your lab results and medication instructions. My care coordinator Nicole was amazing. She was constantly available by phone or email and ensured that all of my questions or concerns were answered. They called when they said they would and all verbal instructions were backed up with an email. Everyone was friendly and gentle and nothing was ambiguous.As is the case with large practices, nurse staff quality ranges. We’ve had some very positive interactions and help from nurses, and then some major major oversights and multiple miscommunications in terms of medication instructions that we had to catch ourselves.Eliza was great. She guided me through every treatment. He attitude was always so positive and she always seemed like she was happy to see me and genuinely wished me well. 

The coordinators are good but not great. The main reason is that they are not as organized as some of the other staff. You really have to be on top of them to ensure that you get the right medication and everything is received timely.Olga was our local coordinator, she handled our paperwork and telling us our lab results and what was expected for the following day or week, whichever was appropriate. (We had a different financial coordinator). Olga was not in charge of the day to day blood testing, that was Chrisi, who was always fantastic. There were a few nurses that worked with Dr Copperman that would connect with you re results or directions for special procedures. They were all very upbeat, positive, warm, and excellent communicators. I really enjoy speaking with them. The rest of the nursing staff that took your blood is also very warm, efficient at taking your blood quickly. I have dealt with many nurses who have all been helpful to varying degrees. Courtney, my IVF coordinator, has been absolutely wonderful and accessible.Every member of the nursing team was kind and compassionate. They always made sure we had the information we needed (test results, next steps, medications, etc) and were quick to return phone calls about any questions or concerns. All the staff at RMA and dr ledermans office are smart , warm and compassionate The first nurse Antionette Wearing was ok, but I can't even remember meeting her in person. She didn't really explain things clearly to me, and this would have been essential as it was my first cycle and I had never done injections before. I don't think she was there on my first nurse visit, so I spoke with another nurse. I remember being particularly frustrated when it seemed that Freedom Pharmacy and RMA were making me determine things about the medications that were totally unclear to me (regarding dosages, units, etc.) and I just broke down crying at some point while on the phone with a different nurse at RMA because Antionette wasn't available. The stress of the egg freezing cycle was already overpowering, and the fact that they each seemed to expect me to already know everything despite the videos not being totally clear was unfair, I felt. 

My other nurse Abigail Epstein when I did the February 2020 cycle was much nicer and attentive and I saw and met with her often. I think she was in training when I was doing my last cycle, actually, and she remembered my partner also. Anyway, of course I knew much better what I was doing, but unfortunately, the cycle wasn't successful as an embryo freezing cycle, and that makes me a little doubtful as well of the 1 egg I have frozen still at RMA. Other than that, whenever I spoke to a nurse if I had questions at my monitoring sessions, they were always helpful and kind and did in fact call back (almost always) if I left a message.She was good. Always called me back. But she was busy so hard to get in contact with. Eliza is amazing!! There was another nurse too who comforted me when I cried about starting PIO. I wish I remember her name.
Overall, the nurses are amazing there. Most nurses were patient and compassionate on the phone. They have the hardest work, I think, in delivering news of monitoring and successes or failures. They were generally great. The three women who took blood were marvelous. Toward the end of my time there were new women to take blood and they needed more practice but I’m sure would improve quickly given the high volume of the practice. Monitoring hours were first-come, first-served and they were efficent and honest with the time. Really liked the nurses and carer coordinator. No complaints other than getting bad news from strangers and nurses I never met many times which I felt was inappropriate. The whole nursing staff at RMA was amazing.  Martha was who I dealt with on a daily basis and she was great.  She always made me feel welcome and always got back to me very fast whether on the phone or through email.  She really made this experience a great one.  Martha was compassionate and organized. She gave detailed instructions and promptly returned my questions, calls and emails. She was lovely. I emailed her all the time and she was reassuring and answered all my questions same day. The nursing staff are bored and disorganized and almost always rude. They don't answer questions and aren't always up to date on the information that they provide.The nurses were very knowledgeable. Some were also caring, some were cold. Everyone I dealt with at RMA, in both the Brooklyn and Manhattan Office had a warm and friendly demeanor.  I always felt comfortable asking questions and was grateful they were able to answer my questions easily and returned my calls usually within a couple hours.The nurse was very prompt in calling me for every step of the treatment. However, her voicemails would sometimes contradict what she'd tell me on the phone. It's hard to keep track of the schedule so getting contradictory voicemails make it harder.Arielle is the best! She is compassionate and always makes herself available even when she is not actually working.Alissa was great -- very organized, compassionate, and human.  Same for Robin and other nurses, very clear communicators.  I did have a prior coordinator who was not great and I asked to switch and was switched without a problem.My primary nurse was appalling. Never picked up the phone, voice was always monotone and answers seemed almost scripted. 
Other nurses I saw during monitoring or happened to be connected to on the phone were much better - much more informative, compassionate, patient, responsive. It’s a shame that my primary nurse was so unhelpful - a better nurse could’ve answered my questions more directly, prevented my anxieties and me reaching out to Dr Copperman. Dr. Flisser's nurse Ariel was fantastic. Always responded / returned calls promptly, and addressed all of our concerns. It can sometimes be hard to get a hold of a nurse when they are having a busy day or on weekends. But overall we didnt have a question that went more than a day unanswered. Jordyn was an amazing nurse!!  She was always available to answer any question, was through, warm, friendly and compassionate.  I loved working with her and still keep in touch with her!  A+mazing.Audrey the blood tech was amazing and so sweet. Loved her!  Martha was efficient and to the point. Everyone was wonderful. I felt the staff really knew who I was without looking Up my chart. For example, I need a note for work if I am going to be late because of a doctor appointment, and the nurses knew without me even having to ask eventually. It was nice to feel a relationship and geniuine caring. - the RMA team is kick ass. The IVF coordinator and nurse are available over email, and over phone and never take more than a couple of hours to return a call. Everything detail is organized and communicated in full detail.

- Morning monitoring at RMA is a smooth affair. Can sometimes take about an hour, but time it right (e.g. arrive early or late) and you can be in and out within 20 minutes. The folks doing the blood work are especially amazing. We have a thin vein problem and the lab folks were always smiling reassuring, patient

I'm not sure if Erin was the primary nurse but she often was the one who called with instructions. She always was patient with questions. I also heard from Olga a lot. I didn't have too many interactions with nurses in person- mostly just leading up to the instructions for trigger, retrieval, transfer, etc. My ivf coordinator Christina ended up not being extremely helpful. She was new, but I found I could get information from my doctor or nurses, not from her. My coordinator was overall good. She was good at communicating besides a few times when she didn't respond to my email and I had to follow up. Erin was the main nurse we had contact with.  She was very kind and caring and compassionate. All of the nurses I've talked to are good, but Jean-Ann is the best. She offered to help me with injections two mornings when I was there for monitoring, since my husband was out of town. One time she even called me on her day off to respond to an email I had written. I really feel like she's in our cheering section and is hoping for us to succeed. 

Eliza was also awesome. When I got discharged from the RE's office (to my OB), I hadn't said goodbye to her before I left, so she ran out into the hall while I was waiting for the elevator just to say goodbye and good luck. So sweet! Everyone on the support staff was amazing. Even the phlebotomists were sweet and super competent. In the end, I think that makes a bigger difference in the experience than how the doctor talks to you, for example.We were assigned Marlene as our IVF coordinator.  Her job was to help us have a rough schedule, get prescriptions/refills to the pharmacy of our choice, and answer scheduling questions about each part in the procedure.  She was easily reachable by email and was prompt with replying to emails with questions about meds, protocol, and scheduling.  

Most of the nursing staff was incredibly pleasant and understanding and as always there are some standouts.   

Alyssa, was incredibly helpful to me- she's part of the team that you can meet with after monitoring apts for those questions you think of after the dr leaves the room and relaying the instructions after the dr has reviewed the lab work.   She was always compassionate when I felt overwhelmed by the process and was always through when answering questions.  She was also incredibly prompt when responding to emails.

Another standout nurse was Chanel.  She learned my name quickly and always greeted me with a smile and hello and a quick chat.   It was also reassuring to see her familiar face not only in the monitoring apts, but also on the surgical floor with the egg retrieval and transfer.  She just genuinely cared about her patients and making them feel human in a process that is overwhelming and can often make you feel like a number.  I don't really remember but the whole place was not well run it was gloomy in efficient and pleasant and infantizing.For my own cycles my coordinator was Theresa. She was open to questions (I emailed her all the time) and she responded in a timely manner. 

For the donor egg cycle, I worked with Dara. She was also very responsive, answered my 8000 questions, and was patient when I was nervous or needed a little hand holding. I was really on top of calling them and emailing them to make sure I knew everything I had to do.  I think I would advise that all patients do this.  The nurses have the answers but they are very busy.  I recall it was annoying because I didn't have their direct line and always had to call the desk and wait for a call back which didn't always come at a convenient time.anne and hilde were absolutely amazing.   they were my first cycles for my oldest. Second time around his staff was not nearly as good.  HIlde was in midwifery school so wasn't as available and anne was out on maternity leave.  one nurse gave me a dosage error during an iVF cycle and nearly destroyed the cycle.  They were so friendly and thoughtful. Throughout the process they were always available by email or phone. They were always quick to deal with and help with any issues I was facing. They made this process wonderful.I only have spoken with Dara (nurse) over the phone and via email but she is great. She responds quickly to email! 
I met their donor egg coordinator, Fabiana and she is fabulous. She showed compassion during our first meeting and spend time to hear my concerns about using donor egg. 
 Anytime I email the nurses they get back to me with an answer quick and prompt. They are friendly and easy to approach with questions. The nursing staff was good. Given the volume of patients, I did not always speak to my primary nurse. I don't even remember her name. They were knowledgeable and responsive but I did not feel like I got focused care.

I was passed between 2 coordinators. So, I never felt that I had direct care as there was always confusion as to which of the 2 should or could respond to me. Again, this took away from focused care.

My best experience was with one of the nurses that drew my blood. Whenever, she was there, she knew my name and expressed compassion. Unfortunately, there were also nurses that drew my blood that were more interested in discussing their weekend plans with other staff than giving me their full attention. 

If you go to RMA, make sure they are clear who is your primary nurse and your primary coordinator.The supporting stuff are very good, unfortunately i think there are too many patients in the clinic which can make the phone calls you get for the medication to be very late in the day.Impressively coordinated. Quick to follow up and answer questions/get me bloodwork results. Gentle with ovadril shots. Helpful finding me the cheapest pharmacy to get my medicine from when it wasn't fully covered.Our IVF coordinator met with us one time and was unaccessible after that.  In fact, on average it would take her over 24 hours to return an phone call or email...which is very frustrating during the IVF process.  I was forced to rely on nurses who knew very little about my case.Care coordinator was very helpful and organized Dará Berg is the specialist for donor egg recipients. She was incredibly responsive, compassionate and well-versed in the process.there are several nurses who work with this team. I did have one primary nurse. I have found her to be compassionate and knowledgeable. calls were always answered same day within a few hours. emails were answered even quicker then that. sometimes she had to ask the doctor and got back to me in a timely manner always. The nursing staff at RMA are amazing! They really care about the success of your cycle and always have a smile on their face. Lisa Nargi in particular is incredible! His nurse was so friendly and happy all the time. She usually would do blood drawings and when I was nervous she would calm me down.I never got to know my nursing team very well. Estephany was my care coordinator, she was great. There were certain front desk staff that were not friendly or understanding of my situation. Everyone was great and understanding. All staff showed sensitively and were very helpful at passing along any questions we had.Eliza, was quick to get back to us with any questions and was easy to talk to about anything. She delivers results with care and made the whole process one of ease. All nurses, car coordinator and nursing staff were very accommodating and polite. I have a fear of needles and they took the time, never rushed me on blood draws even when they were swamped. I typically saw the same round of nurses and it was nice to always see a familiar face.Leyla is incredible. She responds to me almost immediately and answers all my questions with a lot of compassion and trust. I cannot recommend her enough.Courtney was sometimes a bit confusing.  She ordered the wrong test for my embryos but it ended up working for my specific issue.  There were a few days where I wasn't sure it would work and that I wouldn't be able to test my embryos again.  She was much more communicative than the doctor! Would deserve much more credit for any success, had it happenedThe nurses were always available and amazingly responsive. I received call badlcks in 20 minutes every time I called.The donor egg nursing staff is very engaged and responsive. I thought they did a great job matching our donor and responding to our questions and concerns.Martha is very kind.  Sometimes it seems the staff is overwhelmed with too many people, but she is helpful.Hilda became like a
Friend she was
Wonderful and always talked me through everything. Very pleasant and helpful.
She answered all my questions and replied to my emails very fast.The nursing staff was efficient with good follow through. Emails were returned quickly.RMA is like a factory. Too many things fall through the cracks, at great peril. Eliza couldn’t have been more helpful and compassionate through the process. They were responsive but when the news was bad it's hard for anyone to hear Erin, my nurse is incredible. She's thorough, informative, Empathetic and extremely prompt in getting back to you with results/questions.They were all great -- very accessible, clear and helpful. Provided what the MD didn't.They were very accommodating and thorough. They always responded to email or return calls very quickly. The staff at the front desk welcome and greet you when you sign in- every time you enter. After our initial meeting with Dr. Stein, we then met with our assigned nurse, Eliza, who reviewed our upcoming testing schedule with us. Eliza was amazing, always answering my emails in a timely manner, again no matter how crazy the question, and was always very comforting on the phone. 

IUI requires a few visits to the office each cycle - blood work, follicle monitoring, and the actual IUI procedure itself (you both need to go in that day!). Eliza was the nurse who gave me my trigger shot two times, and if she was working the day I received blood work back, was the nurse who called me. If Eliza was not working that day, each nurse I had/spoke to was just as warm and caring. 

When we had an unsuccessful third IUI attempt, we were obviously upset and disappointed. I spoke with Eliza, who was the support I needed at the time, as I did not know what to do next as I was so accustomed to going in for day 1 blood work to start my next IUI cycle. As our follow up appointment with Dr. Stein was not for another two weeks, she suggested that my husband and I consider trying just one more time so we did not have to spend two weeks just waiting around. We decided to give it one more go.

I got the call from Eliza confirming that the blood work showed I was pregnant - she was as happy as we were!
Martha is extremely through and answers emails and calls you back. She is good at her job and compassionate.  My nurse and care coordinator were great communicators and worked really well as a team. I would always recieve a phone call and email with instructions.They would also write and say in every email to feel free to contact them whenever I had questions. It made me feel comfortable in turning to them for anything. Krista was my favorite nurse at RMA, but they were all good. I was happy to have her as my main nurse and my husband liked her, too, the times that he came in with me. She has a nice, friendly personality and knows her stuff. She was always willing to help and answer questions.Jordyn and Samantha were organized and responsive. At times I was over communicative via email but they put up with me and answered all of my questions and concerns. My nurse was very friendly and accommodating, but I often felt like I was the one keeping the records, not her. Everyone was super friendly, and never made me feel uncomfortable or defective. They were more like a support team.We loved the whole staff at RMA.  Dara in particular was so helpful.  She was responsive and no question was too small.   She got on the phone one weekend to talk to me about the donor process when we had concerns and when there was a small issue with how something was handled, she not only quickly put at us at ease, but she apologized which goes a long way.  There was no defensiveness which I really appreciated.  the whole staff was great.  From the women taking blood in the morning to every person we interacted with throughout the process, they were helpful, empathetic, well-informed and enthusiastic.  We felt very well cared for.My primary nurse was always extremely detailed and thorough when she provided me with any updates and next steps. Although I didn't get all of the information on what comes next from Dr. Stein, I knew I can count on a follow up from my nurse to do so. All of my interactions with the nursing staff were positive.They were very polite and professional.  Not once did I feel like just a number.  The care and patient they provided made me feel human.Nurses were all great. Sometimes it did feel like there were a lot of cooks in the kitchen and I wasn't sure who was paying attention to my upcoming cycles. But once my cycles were underway, all was smooth and nurses responded very quickly to all of my questions and concerns (even the insane ones).Everyone at RMA including other doctors, nurses, medical assistants, financial coordinator, IVF coordinator, and receptionists are pleasant to work with. RMA is an excellent fertility clinic. Everyone at RMA is always respectful, nice, caring, and happy to answer all my questions (I have many). The structure at RMA is very efficient and effective, which works great for my busy schedule. I went to three different offices for monitoring and the services from these offices are consistent. RMA Is a very organized practice and informed me an updated me of all information I needed to know on a timely basis.Tatiana which was Dr Lederman lead nurse was amazing. She was on top of all our calls and would inform us of any changes when they would come up. She really cared and was optimistic the entire way. super helpful and available for questions at all points The nurse's at Dr. Lederman's office in White Plains were wonderful.  Martha always answered any questions or concerns I had and gave me all the information I needed before I left the office.  Martha and Tatiana called and emailed every afternoon with results from blood work and instructions for moving forward.  Thanks for making this such an easy experience!",7.799999999999984,7.899999999999985,"Eliza went above and beyond in her care for me. She was lovely and very helpful and communicative, but because I was never given contact info for Dr. Copperman, she was a poor substitute in the moments when I really needed to speak to my doctor. She was compassionate and very kind to me and my husband. All a result of each team member thinking that someone else was going to tell me. She always let me know when she was available and out of the office with automatic messages. There were a few nurses that worked with Dr Copperman that would connect with you re results or directions for special procedures. We have a thin vein problem and the lab folks were always smiling reassuring, patient

I'm not sure if Erin was the primary nurse but she often was the one who called with instructions. The donor egg nursing staff is very engaged and responsive. She got on the phone one weekend to talk to me about the donor process when we had concerns and when there was a small issue with how something was handled, she not only quickly put at us at ease, but she apologized which goes a long way."
24,RMA of New York,clinic,"The downtown office is small and very efficiently run.  Would highly recommend it over the East Side location, which is large and can be very crowded (you'll have to go to the East Side location for weekend monitoring hours regardless)Monitoring hours are pretty reasonable from 7-8:30 and the turnover is fairly quick. As a new patient, be advised, that you won't be seeing your primary doctor with every visit. This did not bother me though, because everyone I encountered was pleasant.I like this practice because they have morning monitoring hours--from 7am to 8:30am you can walk in without making an appointment and still get to work on time.  If you arrive right at 7am there's rarely a wait and I loved how convenient it was, especially with the frequency of getting blood drawn and testing.  Having been to 2 other clinics previously,this was by far the worst experience.  Communication was non-existent to terrible.  I had to do intramuscular shots - no one showed me how to do them, just sent a video link.  The video was inaccurate, which caused me to incorrectly administer the shots and caused extreme pain at the injection site.  I called immediately and was just told to do it the same way the next night and a nurse would show me next time I was in the office.  I could barely walk for days due to this.  When I complained later, I was told that they knew the videos weren’t right and were remaking them.  Additionally they forgot to prescribe and tell my husband to take antibiotics the night before they needed his sample.  Luckily we caught the mistake and asked about it.You get the sense with Knopman and RMA that they have an agenda, and that is to perform IVF. It is a large clinic, which could be the only source of frustration.  It is extremely well run though, you just need to have clear expectations. Sometimes rotating through different doctors who did not know me, I would be upset, but their expertise and professionalism was always very clear.It's very nice and in a good area. The clinic is clean and I never had to wait a long time. Also I was able to come before work, which is very nice.                                            
                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                
      The office is great, and the staff very attentive and compassionate.                                        

                                                                        ..                                                           









I think that as a weakness they have too many patients.
Strengths, they know what they are doing.the nurse showed compassion. I really didnt deal with them much since i switched clinics after the diagnosis.The woman who took blood was very nice, quiet, did a good job with drawing blood The wait time can be long.  Arrive early to ensure being seen in a timely manner. I can ask them anything and they will get back to me ASAP.Monitoring hours get crazy and you definitely feel like they are rushing to get you in and out.  However, it’s clear they are highly recommended as the waiting room is always full.  Whenever you call with a question, they do a good job of calling you backThey are the best! I had my blood drawn 52 times and it never hurt. :)My experience with the nursing staff at the East Side and SoHo locations were both great. Everyone was very caring and compassionate, and you never felt rushed.

I usually ended up having the same nurses, so it was that much better having familiar faces!Nice and efficientKatrina is fantastic, empathetic, professional and really helpful and informative. The other nurses were also ok, but not all very helpful. I don’t say this lightly, but truly feel the clinic is just trying to make money and doesn’t have the patients best interest in mind. Compared to other places we have been, I can’t come up with a single strength for this placeThe nursing staff... Seems like there were a dozen and I spoke to a different person on the hotline every time.  The nurse coordinating medications was so disorganized.  If I wasn't an organized intelligent and highly educated person... I wouldn't have had the medication I needed to continue with treatment.The nursing staff is amazing. They kept in touch regularly and followed up promptly after every visit. The communication of all the nursing staff wonderful. They are very friendly and helpful with any questions. If I ever needed to speak to a nurse I could easily call and talk to someone quickly.Very professional and caring The interactions with the office were handled by distinct functional role - dr, nurse, front desk, billing, finance / insurance - yet they all seemed to be playing a cruel and unprofessional game of broken telephone with one another - especially the billing/finance/insurance team. The dr. would schedule a saline sonogram, and the finance person would reach out to confirm that I was coming in for IVF (no!!). The dr. would invite me for the next round of diagnostics (with no concluded diagnosis yet), and the billing person would send me paperwork to file claims of ""Infertility"" with my insurance company. It created a real sense of unease, and I ultimately stopped seeing this clinic as a result.RMA does a great job of getting results. They can be super busy at times, and depending on when you go the wait times can be long, but it's an incredibly competent office with a very strong team. The nurses always were very thorough when giving me the daily instructions and would email me with written instructions so I was never confused about how much medicine I needed to admister each day. They returned my calls promptly and usually responded to emails within a day. Loved working with Krista! She's kind, warm and full of compassion. She knows the work well. She took time when answering our questions and feels happy for our results. The nursing staff was amazing at RMA! They were always friendly, professional, and helpful with questions. I appreciated all the support they provided during my time there. It's really hard to rate the nursing staff because it was so large. Some people were great. Some people were mediocre. Once I went and waited over an hour for a scheduled insemination because they had forgotten me--and I didn't speak up, I just waited patiently. Other times, I was seen right away. Some nurses were great at blood draws. Some weren't. I have a feeling things are a little better (ie. less busy) at the west side clinic.The nurses seemed nice but since I was not seeing the same nurse consistently they didn't have much of a connection to patients.Did treatments as a single mother by choice using donor sperm. Nurses frequently (at least 50%) of the time did not check my chart before coming in to see me and would give me instructions based on an assumption that I was in a heterosexual relationship (after the trigger, here's when you should have intercourse, etc.). This is pretty unacceptable considering that RMA prides itself on supporting same-sex couples and single mothers by choice.Our experience was great. The clinic in the west side is smaller and it feels more personable. Also most of the time we barely had to wait. The east side is more crowded so there is more wait time, but most doctors and nurses in both clinics were great. The way they organize the visits is very efficient so the visits can be quick, but we never felt rushed when we had questions.It can be very crowded during monitoring hours, which can get overwhelming. Stay patient, and focus on the bigger picture. The doctors are all very knowledgeable, but it just feels like morning monitoring isn't the best time for questions - especially if it's not your regular doctor. Be sure to ask to speak to a nurse if you feel like your questions weren't addressed during monitoring. Very polite, professional; specially the staff assigned in the OR was always nice and concerned in my wellbeing It's a large clinic with multiple locations and many patients, but the staff does make you feel like you are a human, which we really appreciated. (We didn't have much of an interaction beyond a few consultations and workup, because we went elsewhere for our actual treatment.) It felt like RMA is run well. Both our appointments were on time and we didn't have any billing issues.Very organized , sometimes wait times during weekend monitoring hours are long. You need to be on top of them with your paperwork and blood work, they don't always call u back for results u need to call backThey would coordinate with each other about what was going on. If something didn't match up with what I heard I would tell them and they would find out immediately. They were polite and compassionate and informative. There are a huge number of patients. I believe that the doctors and nurses are likely taxed from the numbers of patients and that care suffers as a result. Some of the explanations of procedures seem a bit rote, which I imagine comes from the volume of patients they see. The clinic is busy so unless you get there at the start of monitoring hours, expect a bit of a wait (especially if you have to go to the east side office). One complaint is that they didn't charge copays upon receipt of services, do the bills I received were often a bit confusing.They were very competent and caring. The clinic is efficient, I did not wait more than 30 min during any follow up visits or lab draws. The staff from the front desk to billing were efficient, receptive to questions. It is one of the best run offices I have been to. I expected to wait much longer since I have been to doctors' offices and experienced rude staff or long wait times. Not the case with RMA I had no problems with the nursing staff. They were great!great staff, good attitudeKnowledgeable and experienced staff.  High volume of patients - which means that the operations are managed well, but it can feel a bit impersonal.  Considering the volume of patients, the staff works hard to make you feel like you are getting individualized attention.RMA downtown is much better than uptown. Smaller, more intimate. Because RMA is such a large practice, you have to trust in the process. But make sure you double check your insurance coverage, co-pays, etc.  I had difficulty getting them to fight the insurance company for pharmacy benefits - something about them using fertility codes rather than gynecological codes - for meds for my treatment.It's definitely a bit of a factory feel, but it also runs like a well-oiled machine.The nurses at RMA have to handle hundreds of patients so you cannot expect too much from them. That being said they are great about calling you back, following up and answering every crazy question and concern.  They are experts and really can answer anything.The woman that takes my blood is very sweet. 

The only issue that I had with the nursing staff is they forgot about me when i was dropping off a sperm sample. I waited for 45 mins, freaking out about all the time that was passing, but no one spoke to me until I made a big deal with the front desk.After my surgery on a Saturday afternoon I called to inquire about pain meds (I hadn't been given any) and they told me they couldn't connect me to a doctor.Strengths are the amount of knowledge and great communication. Weaknesses are the monitoring hours; this is limited and may interfere with work schedules. Monitoring hours on weekends was in Manhattan, not their Long Island office. Although, I believe this  has since changed. Overall, however, I would highly recommend! It was an effiecent well-oiled machine.  The office opened promptly at 7:30 and you aren't there for more than 40 minutes.  I would suggest getting there as early as possible.  Very comprehensive care and multiple locations make it easy to get to and be seen when needed and still get to work on time. Very important as a teacher who starts work before 8:30. This was one of my greatest fears of missing work time The clinic is clean and efficient. They do not allow children which is considerate of the patients. The waiting room is very busy therefore it is best to arrive early during monitoring hours. The front desk staff was hit or miss in terms of friendliness.Caring and nice. Responsive at all times. Layla and her staff were wonderful and caring. They actually kept in touch with me during my pregnancy to just check in!Good. Pretty quick interaction with them but they're good. I did find that some nurses did not communicate the correct directions to me and so I had to be aware of things on my own and follow up a few times. Good. Pretty quick interaction with them but they're good. It's always packed there - get to your appointments and monitoring hours early.Always very warm and chatty and were great at passing on informationThe downtown location for rma is much smaller than midtown location so was easy and the wait wasn't long. On the weekends I had to go to the midtown location and it felt more impersonal. I didn't enjoy calling the main number bc I would often wait on hold Or not get the result I wanted in an efficient wayIn the middle of a cycle, when stress is at the highest, they will go out of their way to be calm, kind and clear.Everyone with knowledgable and helpful. Excellent supporting staff and everything runs very smoothly. Most of the visits are very quick and you barely have to wait for few minutes before being seen. Everything is very well organized and you never feel rushed. The doctors and nurses will patiently answer your questions.They all acknowledged me when I was in the office and were genuinely happy when I came back into the office with a positive pregnancy result.The welcoming staff weren't has warm as the doctor but that did not worry me. They were very nice, professional, quick and communicated well. I was able to call the front desk with questions and they would respond as soon as they could.It was excellent, again highly professional and punctual. Compassionate, careful. I have bad veins, but they were able to do the bloodwork expertly. Great staff!Most of them are great.  A few seemed disorganized.They had trouble managing me as a distance patient. Corteous, professional and thoroughit's a factory with lots of people so don't expect personal care.The waiting time isn’t as bad as others - is Columbia. They have the process down well and know what you are in for when you arrive. The nurses who draw blood aren’t the best though. The office seems clean enough but it isn’t updated at all.The nursing staff was very good couldn’t ask for a better staff. The made them self available to answer every phone call or email My IVF coordinators were great but the nurses were sometimes hit or miss.  This was particularly an issue over the holidays when they had people filling in. Compassionate staff and run effectively. When you come for regular monitoring, you will see different staff members but any bookable slots are with your team. For weekend monitoring, this is done at the east side location. Overall nursed at RMA were very helpful in answering questions. There was the only nurse who was not being helpful at all...The finance dept was the weakest, but after switching coordinators we got the info we needed. They were prompt with my insurance company with getting the preapprovals. The locations of the offices are very convenient. We found better care in the West side office than the Soho office.Most of the nurses were compassionate and attentive but there was one who was not as compassionate as I would have hoped. She seemed almost like a robot and like she was annoyed at the questions I was asking. I was nervous after the transfer because of some cramping. She was very matter of fact in her advice. They have several locations and the Madison Avenue location has long opening hours. So that makes it convenient. It's hard to get a hold of your specific care team member, because they only have one phone number that covers all the clinics. The office is run exceptionally well, especially considering it's always full. The staff is great. There can be long waits at times, but overall things move. The practice is a well-oiled machine and you never feel neglected or forgotten. They communicate well and are friendly and respectful.Convenient locations and hours. Organized. Appreciated the work of the IVF coordinator and the finance team to answer many questions. Staff is helpful and caring. Can’t get a nurse on the phone, however they call back in a practical time frame. I spent most of my time at the East Side location - the team there was very thorough and took their time to assist with whatever questions \ needs  I had.

The team at SoHo was also great, but sometimes I felt a little bit more rushed or cramped in at that office.Strengths: locations all around Manhattan; well established clinic made me feel like I was in good hands; everyone at clinic was very responsive.

Weaknesses: videos showing how to administer treatments were just okay. Large practice - so great lab, facilities, and physicians and nurses. But also the volume of patients means occasional hiccups with admin things (billing, call backs). In the clinical part of our experience, we had nothing but supportive care. The biggest strength is that they know what they're doing.The doctors and nurses are very professional, and they will recommend a treatment that will help you with your specific fertility issue. Although not necessarily a weakness, but just mostly a reality of life, they're there to provide a service and might not always give you the emotional support that an excited and anxious potentially mom-to-be is expecting.“They get the job done” someone told me and they were right. Weakness of the clinic is that the east side office is unhelpful and unresponsive. I had a very bad experience when I went there at 11 weeks after waking up to a gush of blood. I had called the on call doctor who never called me back. Because it was a Saturday I went to the east side-the only open location. They had me wait for a while then said nobody could see or speak with me because I was too far along (had been told conflicting info earlier in my treatment). At this point I’d been going to RMA for over a year and this was shocking and very upsetting. I insisted on speaking with someone and the clinician who told me “legally we can’t see you” wouldn’t tell me her name and was very antagonistic. So I went to an ER and found out I had a threatened miscarriage. The nurses always seem extremely busy. The phone calls are rushed. Generally they are helpful but I always felt like I needed to push to get an extra minute on the phone to ask questions. They are organized and all very well informed and confident. The nurses that help with the retrievals and transfers are wonderful and compassionate. The nursing staff are always friendly, supportive throughout the process and prompt in calling back when I have phoned for any questions.They take their time to talk to you and answer your questions.  They are sensitive to your needs and help you thru the process.  I liked the professionalism and honesty. It’s not an easy thing to go thru. I also liked how they walked us thru the entire process. RMA East side has a lot of patients and it can give the sense of being in a factory. The clinic is clean and the nurses are well prepared, but the receptionists and some phone ladies can be very rude and really impersonal. The nursing staff at RMA are awesome! Very organized,  respond promptly to any concerns, and very nice. The nursing staff treated patients like cattle. It was very difficult to get them on the phone to answer questions or request information.I had a few nurses call me most frequently.  They were nice and very professional, but not very compassionate. I love them.  I think they have all been so kind, thorough and supportive through the process. The have all communicated very well, and even when I have called the offices (what I feel like is) 100 times, they are always so so patient and understanding.Our lead IVF coordinator was amazing. But the nurses that called with information each time after a morning monitoring were sometimes not clear with instructions / next steps. There were two nurses, Leila and Jordyn, who we saw the most and were extraordinarily knowledgeable, kind and even somehow fun. Of course, over multiple cycles we might have seen a dozen nurses. All were good, but not all were great. Sure, that can be unnerving at sensitive times, but it's wasn't actually a problem. If ever something seemed off or an instruction was worded vaguely, we just called later in the day. A different nurse would take our call and help us clear it up.The phlebatomist is the only pleasant person who knows what she is doing and does it well.  

The receptionist is awful.  She's cosntantly scowling and rude to patients.  Her temperament would be better suited for someone who didn't have to interact with people. 

During my treatment here, I have seen 5-6 different doctors.  I understand it takes a team, but the number of people that I was bounced around to led to a horrible patient experience and low quality of care.  When I had questions - people didn't have the answers because they didn't know my case and it took 3-5 phone calls to ever get a knowledgeable person on the phone.There are all different nurses each day and at each clinic. They are all really nice and helpful. Some were more helpful in answering questions than others. I really liked the nurses at the Brooklyn clinic where I was receiving most of my monitoring. The clinic runs very well. From the outset of treatment we were assigned a team which consisted of doctor/co-ordinator/finance/nursing. Our co-ordinator Norma is the best. She is very thorough and organized and put us at ease with everything leading up to our first cycle. She has been a great point of contact throughout our process and has made everything seamless.Organized, readily available, always returned calls, followed up after morning monitoring with emails to re-confirm the results of your monitoring and thus what dosages/meds to take.The nursing staff was amazing at RMA NY. They were organized, on the ball, and compassionate. I felt like they were on the top of their game and like I wasn't going to fall through the cracksRMA is huge.  I spoke with countless nurses. They were all competent and compassionate. The Westchester location is excellent, with only 2 doctors during monitoring hours.  Warm staff, easy communication, questions always answered.  However, RMANY is a large company.  If you need monitoring on a weekend or holiday, you are stuck with a random doctor and a huge waiting room filled to the max with people and names being yelled from every direction.  It is far from pleasant.I requested a nurse to contact me, she called on a private number and did not leave contact information. I called back and left her a message and never heard back. I was informed 3 weeks later that she was on maternity leave and ""never received my message"" (blood work done pre-procedure). I was then contacted by a nurse who was kind and answered all my questions.I only dealt with the nursing staff for a handful of months, but they were kind and compassionate.Strengths: always on time for appointments and doctors perform ultrasounds
Weakness: monitoring hours should've began earlier and sometimes there was too much of a push for IVF, the clinic seemed very numbers driven I did not have much interaction with the nurses because I was monitored by my OBGYN and just saw Dr Klein for the IUIs. The nurses who I did have contact with were always very nice and informative. They were very nice and pleasant but you still feel like your being moved through an assembly line during morning monitoring. The nurse that was assigned to always sounded kinda cranky. But they called in a timely manner to let you know what meds to take and when to come in againThe nurses had little interaction with me. They would call each day with my dosage of stimulation drugs. But they did not get to know me or even engage in friendly conversation. I felt like a step in the factory assembly line.The systems and daily operations are very straight forward and easy to navigate. I am an RMA west side patient. However, procedures bad weekend monitoring is done at the east side location. It's very busy!. Staff is always willing to help. 
Finance, check in, phone calls, after hours service. All very easy to navigate. I had to call continually because nurses often failed to respond before 3pm. Which is stressful if you're doing an IVF the first time. They offered little information. In fact, my FSH was very high during the cycle. I told the nurse it seemed wrong and she dismissed my concerns. There was little personal attention.  I am thrilled with Dr.Davis, his receptionist, nurse, and all of the staff who draw blood during monitoring hours. These are the people I see most often on my visits. I have not been as happy with the coordinators, but I deal with them a lot less.Warm , compassionate and caring are some words that come to mind when thinking of the nursing staff .  I was told at the last minute that I needed another medication  exhausted od my bloodwork and I was panicking because I didn’t k ow how I’d get it in such a short  space of time . Unfortunately , I don’t recall her name but she ended up giving me  the medication  and tried to calm me down . I was so appreciative of the kind gesture that was shown to me . When I had to meet with the nursing staff to discuss medication or had additional questions related to treatment the ladies were very compassionate and patient . They empathized with my situation and made attempts to keep me calm .Strength: The know what they’re doing. There’s always a nurse to answer questions. The staff is overall very friendly and accommodating. 

Weakness: During monitoring, and especially at RMA East, you can feel like just a number. It gets super busy and sometimes you wait for upwards of a hour. Sometimes you don’t get to see your doctor, which can be stressful.Sometimes I would see the nurse in Long Island. When i went for my ultrasounds she would just give me the size and saw i was ready. Even after a failed IUI, we never looked at weather or not the timing was off. 
One nurse in the NYC offive forgot to call in my first Ovidrel so I had to pay out of pocket for it. Also I found out I was pre paying for my trigger and it was supposed to be covered the whole time by my insuranceThe nurses at RMA of New York ranged from pretty nice to very nice. All of the questions I had throughout my IVF cycle were answered by the nurses vs. the doctors. Whenever I asked, they would sit down with me to walk me through the process and help me figure out my ""medication ordering plan"" (since I found the process of ordering the meds to be more stressful than actually taking them). The upper east side location has many patients and the phlebotomy staff is large which keeps up with the demand for the daily blood draws and ultrasounds. I once did an IUI over a holiday weekend and there was even staff available then which was reassuring. I also used their facility in Brooklyn Heights which was more convenient for me but smaller.  I appreciated that flexibility, when necessary and I always found everyone friendly and helpful. RMA is a cattle call. Appointments are never on time and trying to get through on the phone is just as stressful - you're guaranteed to listen to a lot of hold music. They are also very shady about billing practices. My husband was going somewhere with Zika before an egg retrieval, so we had him freeze sperm in advance, just in case. When he returned, Zika-free, and we proceeded with the transfers with fresh sperm, we assumed the frozen sperm had been thrown out, since no one told us otherwise. Six months after we stopped going to RMA, we received a $500 bill for the storage of the sperm. We are still trying to untangle this mess, both in terms of paying the bill and also making sure they stop storing his sperm, and it's now been 8 months since we left the practice. The finance team has been nothing but rude and lacking in compassion this entire process. I always get different nurse on each blood work result and call back. They are give clear instructions and answer my questions. Strengths are efficiency. I was VERY surprised for NYC and how busy they were that I never waited more than 10-15 minutes in the waiting room, a lot better than my OB's office ! Also they were very friendly. The nurses called back very quickly and were good about getting any questions I had answered. I also liked that I had a way to communicate with Dr. Kudesia over email. I found that very personal. The weaknesses were that it has a feeling of being a business and that they almost hope you have to jump to IVF. In our case we do have to jump to IVF because of my age and my husbands sperm motility, and I just wished from day one they would have made him get tested. I saw numerous nurses over the course of my year at RMA.  The quality of the staff differed, but they were available to answer questions when I called RMA.there were several nurses and I never knew who to contact. This was where problems arose with each nurse not knowing my care plan. I had to explain it repeatedly. The nurses are wonderful at RMA.The nursing team was very good in communicating the results; answering our questions with regard to any concern or medication; reachable easily; called back ASAP in case of immediate need (like spotting / medication dosage questions / urgent refills). They were also very helpful in navigating me to the right pharmacy to get medication immediately, when my initial pharmacy failed to deliver on time. Excellent co-ordination and timing during morning monitoring hours. It took me less than half hour most days for monitoring in the morning and was able to get back to work on time. Initial paperwork, tests for spouse, insurance approvals were also handled without any hassles.  The clinic is clean. They have protocols in place. The Dr.’s are nice. Runs like a machine with a lot of moving parts. Hard to contact nurses and doctors directly. You call and contect to the main office on Madison Ave regardless of what location you go to. Once you get an operator, they transfer you call to the local office and you have to restate why you are calling before they transfer you or take a message. When I went for office visits, I saw a rotating set of doctors instead of my primary doctor, Dr. Thornton. I felt more like a number then a human at RMA. They are efficient at IVF but lack a human touch. I felt like a cash cow to RMA. The process is hard enough, you don’t need the added stress of dealing with the office. The nursing staff always had a smile on their face and very accommodating. Made you feel at ease very early in the morning and throughout entire process. Always available to answer questions. RMA is a remarkably well-oiled machine. When you schedule an appointment, they handle everything with care and efficiency and you can get in and out and go about your day. I loved the early morning appointments and knowing that I wasn't going to spend all day in a doctor's office, especially because of the frequency of visits relating to fertility treatments. The waiting room is nice and comfy, and the office becomes, in a way, your home away from home, because you spend so much time there. Although you do not always see the same nurses/doctors, they are transparent with each other about your level of care, so you do not feel like you are just being shuffled from person to person. It is a large clinic, so you will likely be seeing different doctors at different appointments, but all of the doctors are fantastic, so you are in good hands! Although Dr. Sandler was my assigned doctor (and I think he is phenomenal), I also saw Dr. Grunfeld quite frequently (I guess our schedules were more aligned) and he is also a phenomenal physician. I spoke with so many nurses here and the experience really varied dependent on who you spoke with. I think all the nurses seemed competent. They provided clear instruction 95% of the time and would be willing to provide you with information if you asked. They would not automatically provide you with information such as embryo grading, so you sort of need to know what to ask for. I get the impression that the clinic sees so many patients that they are just trying to manage their time. It's a large clinic, and it could get very busy in the mornings. While the wait could last up to 40 minutes, they were very efficient once they saw you. The ladies that did the blood draws were very warm and friendly. I would recomend arriving at the clinic right at 7 if you need to be at work before 9. If you are more flexible with time, arriving closer to 8:30 always worked well for me. By then, most of the morning rush had cleared out. All nurses at RMA Madison Ave. branch were very helpful and clear in their guidance/instructions. I always though I was being a pain by asking them so many questions, but they all made me feel conformable by asking questions and requesting additional guidance. At RMA you see whatever dr. is rounding on the days that you visit. I had good experiences with all the doctors. The nurses were also helpful. I've had some difficulties dealing with the financial team in terms of responsiveness, but nothing that would push me to not work with RMA again in the future.The nursing team and IVF coordinator are amazing. They're super sweet and responsive. You deal more with them then your doctor since you see whichever doctor is on rotation during monitoring but your specific doctor will review your results and have the nurses call you. Convenient location. Relatively short waiting time.The nursisng staff at RMA is ok. There are some absolutely wonderful nurses there and a few that need to work on organization. All are pleasant and have great bedside manner.Some nurses were really nice. Jordan was the most compassionate nurse when delivering news on the phone. Leyla was the complete opposite and made me cry even more because of how she delivered sensitive information. She was very cold and uncaring.The nursing staff is overall very responsive and very nice. I have no complaints about them.I am currently 20 weeks pregnant from my one and only IVF transfer with RMA. Our issue was male factor infertility. We were lucky to get pregnant on the first try. I'd like to think that my opinion of the clinic is truly based on my experience  there and not just that getting pregnant was relatively easy for us!

I was a patient at RMA Downtown, a small, intimate office which was very convenient to my home and work. I was able to go in for morning check ups and I could be the first patient seen if I got there right before 7:30. I chose this clinic primarily for insurance reasons and proximity to home and work.  

My husband and I both felt they were very on top of our care. They have their systems in place, we felt they worked like a well oiled machine. They were up  front about our out of pockets costs, which so far have proven accurate (though still waiting for all bills to come through).  The doctor and coordinator were easy to get in touch with, though I tended to communicate with the coordinator directly most of the time. There are periods of intense communication and frequent visits and they all went smoothly. 

RMA is a very big operation and I did have to go to the midtown office several times for any weekend check ups, retrieval and transfer.  Things were fine there though it's much more busy and less comfy as a patient. 

Overall, our experience was overwhelmingly positive and drama free, perhaps because it was brief and free of complications. However, should we decide to do another embryo transfer, I would certainly go back to RMA again. I called numerous times with questions and the nurses were always helpful or quick to return my call. The nursing staff at the monitoring sessions were all very caring and pleasant.  The nurses that would call with instructions or answer questions were very organized and prompt.  With the exception of one nurse, they were generally very quick to give information and sometimes I felt like I was being rushed off the phone.  Some seemed somewhat unhappy to be doing what they were doing.  I know we all have bad days and things going on outside of work, but this is a very sensitive field to be working in so one would think they would have been a bit more compassionate. This clinic is similar to others in that it’s a bit of a machine. Many people there first thing in the morning, waiting for your name to be called, mostly friendly staff at the front desk/billing. I did not appreciate that the billing department screwed up a few of my bills and directed me to the wrong insurance causing me to have to pay for IVF. Make sure to speak with more than 1 person and take down their name. Thankfully this clinic is mostly well-organzied. They didn’t lose my information or bother me about paperwork that I had already turned in like another clinic that I went to. Show up early for your IUI visits because that waiting room fills up fast and there's usually a wait. Keep in constant communication with the doctors and nurses. If you care, ask for a female technician. They're there but there are so few of them I feel like advocacy might help.The nurses were all great and patient...it was just that they were ALWAYS different. Very caring, but inconsistent. They just all seemed very busy. Number not a human.  Packed waiting rooms, no one knows you, all profit, no compassion.  Total factory.The only pro I have of RMA downtown was it's convenient location and that we saw Dr. Knopman there. I disliked pretty much everything else. Their admin staff tried to tell us a $10,000 out of pocket test was required and our cycle was cancelled until we did it. Dr. Knopman had told us this was absolutely not the case since we had already done screening for tay sachs and we were not carriers. I had to get Dr. Knopman to step in. Nobody else would listen to me. It has been a while, and my recall is limited, but I do remember a nurse named Janice.  I was not happy with her at all.  I feel that she lacked a certain amount of empathy you would need to work with women struggling with fertility.  I also recall having to visit the Manhattan location on a weekend as the White Plains location was closed.  On two occasions I was waiting to be seen and nurses forgot I was there, resulting in me having to get dressed and find someone to attend to me.The Westside location is smaller, more personal, and tended not to be too crowded or have long waits for morning monitoring. Procedures were done at the main east side office, which was a bit more hectic and tended to have more waiting.Locations were good. I did not like that monitoring only was early in the morningThey were fine. Always a wait.they were ok but it's a farm there - so many patients and everyone is overworked.They were different every time.  The phlebotomists were the WORST and I had bruises all the time.  The nursing staff did not seem to want to get involved in continuity of care.  I asked if I could see the same person and was told that it was ""whoever is on call.""  They all seemed young and disengaged.  I can't say enough about Dr. Lederman's nursing staff.  He only had 2 nurses that were taking care of everyone.  They would respond to emails and phone calls in a timely manner.  They would always answer any questions that I had regarding results or anything else that I may be inquiring about.  They would be really happy for you if you got a positive outcome.  They excitement was heard in their voice when they would call with results, or when they would tell you about going in to hear the heartbeat for the first time.  They were also really sympathetic if things didn't work out, and would show compassion for what you were going through.They were very professional, organised, patient and knowledgeable.There were many, many nurses.  I don't believe I ever had one more than 2 or 3 times.  Several were down right rude and horrible.  One even said, ""I don't know why you are bothering to do this.""  As though I had come up with the protocol or what should be done.  I did have one nurse who was so nice and friendly.  She didn't seem to be there for long though.  Monitoring is sort of a shit show  - on any given day there could be at least 20 people waiting!  I dont think this was specific to RMA, I think its an NYC problem, as I had a similar experience at Columbia.  But, the waiting room at RMA is nice and it goes pretty quickly.  They let you get there really early so you can be there before they even start calling patients to get ahead of the crowd.  Overall, monitoring is so depressing.  Unless they handed out coffee and donuts I honestly dont think it could be any better than it was at RMA.RMA is very well run and very warm.  The doctors have coordinators and nurses who work their patients.  I went for screening at the East side location and in Brooklyn.  Sometimes screening in Brooklyn could take a long time because there was only one doctor.  You could always meet with a nurse during screening too.  Honestly, I mostly worked directly with Dr. Klein but I don't remember any negative interactions with anyone other than a receptionist who found my concern for privacy amusing.Monitoring hours are 7-8.30am so it was perfect to be able to go before going to workEveryone in the office is professional and very calm. Nurses are always responsive and helpful. monitoring hours are 7 am to 8:30 am - extremely convenient. Waiting room can get crowded but there's coffee, tea and water. The clinic had good communication with me over e-mail so far. I appreciated that I could ask whatever questions I had and expect a timely answer. The e-mail point person switched several times within the last year, which could be confusing, but the clinic was consistent in following up with me.They really have a professional and well organised staff.  Sometimes there are a lot of patients waiting for daily controls but the way the clinic is organised makes everything fast and nice. 
The rooms and ORs are ok.They generally seem to be too busy. And when they call, their tone is way too obvious about whether they have good or bad news. It’s ridiculous.The nurses were great but the coordinator staff and reception is severely lacking. They are not one and the same. The coordinators tend to be very disorganized and are not proactive in managing your care. Be sure to ask questions and keep track of everything on your own as you'll need to cross-check their communication.I know several of the nurses by name, they are super friendly and helpful, and responsive. The nursing staff is the best. They always available when I call them. And help me with anything.Almost all of the nurses are very sensitive and communicate Instructions clearly. Nice but do not always explain everything thoroughly.The Brooklyn staff were very caring and called with updates throughout my Ivf process. If I had questions about medication I was able to contact the clinic and someone would call back usually within 30-1hr. The nurses were great with blood work and in my appointments but the nurses who called me clearly told everyone the exact same thing.  If I hadn’t really advocated for myself and insisted on speaking to my doctor before purchasing medication I would have purchased unnecessary medication.This is a very busy office. Their morning monitoring hours are perfect for the working person. I like that bloodwork and sono were done fairly quickly and i was able to get out quite fast and get to work on time. You will not always see your doctor but a doctor always performs your sonograms and answer any questions you may have. The nurses that draw your blood work soo hard and are very kind.RMA downtown is a well-oiled and efficient operation.  They have access to the midtown lab and facility, but it's a smaller operation, which I preferred.  The strengths are that you have access to a range of services and expertise, the same thing can be a weakness because at midtown, you are one among many.  At the downtown practice, I felt more like a person than a case number.The nurses are wonderful! They always answered all questions and returned my calls promptly. It's true it's a well-oiled machine, but one that works! Go as early as possible for monitoring or risk waiting a while. It is busy in the mornings, so I like to get there extra early so that I can get in and out for monitoring.  They charge for helping you administer shots. In my other clinics they did it for freeThe downtown practice is much more personal than the midtown practice, which I found helpful.  It was also much more convenient to where I live and faster to get in and out of.  Overall, RMA is a well-oiled machine with a well-regarded lab.  Horrible. Very long waits unless there right when the doors opened. VERY longNurses were excellent. Very informative and always happy to answer questions. Very compassionate and sensitive to the needs of fertility patients.  For the most part there was a line since we're in a metro area. They were pretty quick with the bloodwork. They would tell us ahead of time to make sure we got in early, but traffic to get there was a factor as well - so it was a domino affect. They wouldn't be able to control how many people would come in everyday. Sometimes it was smooth sailing.Very compassionate but not all could draw blood well and sometimes it took several times.They answered questions but I didn't get a lot of compassion at missed attempts or after ruptured ectopic that almost killed me. went in for early monitoring hours before work so was convenient - 7am -9am - wait times would vary,  you wanted to get there before 8 or it would be too crowded and you would wait 1/2 hour. I did not have large interactions with them during consultation aside from ultrasound. Nurse was very nice during that.While the monitoring hours are early, the office gets busy quickly. That said, the office is like a well-oiled machine and the wait was generally tolerable.-Monitoring hours are great because they are super early allowing flexibly and limited work disruption.  
-Monitoring visits are quick if you arrive early. 
-Office is in a great location. 
-Office is very organized.Even though it is a big clinic you are still treated like a human and not overlooked. Everything is taken care of for you and they are on top of everything. The financial advisor is amazing and tries to help you save money with insurance and explains everything very clearly Strengths.  Process and communications.  The morning process and calls and emails with directions were always efficient.

Cons: Own your financial matters.  You need to know your coverage ask questions and followup. Mistakes are made and they aren't proactive enough in planning.Clean, efficient, and well equipped with what seemed like modern technology. Waiting time in the mornings was not very long for monitoring. Multiple locations within NYC which was helpful. No children allowed in waiting room which I appreciated.  The clinic was so organized and everyone on the clinical team was really helpful. I really felt like I was in good hands. The finance people were also very responsive, but sometimes they provided me with misinformation and/or confused me. For example, I was told that a procedure would be covered by insurance, but then after the procedure, I was told that actually it wasn’t covered and I had to pay out of pocket. Luckily, I had it all in writing, and they ended up writing it off—but it was super upsetting and stressful. The best were the clinic associates. The ones helping the monitoring. That is a rocking team !They were organized, had good monitoring hours (7AM - 8:30AM) and were always available via phone when needed.  Very little wait time.  The nurses are great. They return phone calls quickly, answer all of my questions, and really show empathy and compassion. They don't make me feel silly for asking redundant or embarrassing questions. Kind and efficient.As a patient, I did not form any personal relationship with the nursing staff nor was any nurse educated about my specific case.Too big- it's a reproductive mill!! On the weekends, the east side clinic was very crowded because it is the only one that is open. Bring a good book!Seemed to be informative, patient and thorough. I felt confident in my care. Not overly warm, but kind enough.Monitoring was mostly well-oiled; the waits were never onerous. I appreciated that they did not feel
disruptive to the work day, but it also meant luck of the draw (ha ha) for phlebotomists and doctors. Monitoring hours at the uptown location are a cattle call- you have no idea how long you will be waiting. The newly opening downtown location is amazing. Its clean, quick and better organized.The clinic felt like a factory.  Sometimes wait times were very long.Was pretty quick and first come first serve so i tried to get there early since I had a long commute to the city after my apptThey were extremely responsive and helpful. Very efficient, we arrived at 6:15 am and they were incredibly empathetic of our situationHigh volume & can seem just like a number at times. However, the front desk staff is very nice as were the nurses who drew blood during monitoring hours. Different coordinators do meet seem to coordinator with each other (I had an issue regarding starting IVF without checking if I was approved yet for treatments by insurance). They have a lot of patients. That means you are one of many but also means they have everything down to a science in terms of process and organization. You won't see the same doctor every time but that also means you really never have to wait for an appointment or a transfer or bloodwork or an ultra sound. 
They are very responsive via email. The finance department told me exactly what I would be paying for and how much. Im concerned about the price and am shopping around. They said it would cost 8k. That is a lot for me out of pocket. The window of time was generous however it did get very crowded so it was best to go early.Expect bills sent months later. Finance team is working weird imo. Coordinator was not too sharp in my case, there were lots of wrong info passed by her that i had to dig in and get corrected. So, good luck with that. 
Clinic in general -except Brooklyn location- is clean and nice. 
Nurses are the best thing of RMA of NY. Awesome they answered all questions and very promptly The place is busy. Always. It made me trust that they knew what they were doing, if for nothing else because they did it so much. But you need to keep up on your own schedule and not trust that they are able to- they’re too busyThe best thing about working with RMA is that they have done this all before. They are seriously pros. They know their stuff there and they have a system for everything. They walk you through all of the procedures and teach you how to do anything (inject Ovidrel) that you haven't done before. You can wait for a long time on a Saturday. 
The finance department does not always explain all your options. Ask questions. 
The nurses are responsive and great. 
If you have questions take the time to meet with your nurse after morning hours. Knowledgeable, nice and professionalStrenghts: research, kind docs, multiple clinic locations
Weaknesses: busy especially on weekendsstrengths: clean, well-established, responsive. 
weaknesses: sometimes during monitoring hours, it can feel very factor farm like with all the women waiting. Medical assistants were all friendly .. nurse was okay The clinic's hours are highly convenient for a working person. They allow you to come in during early hours for monitoring. There were times that the clinic was very busy in the morning so there was a long wait. The clinic was great.   Busy.  But ran like clockwork.  strengths: clean, well-established, responsive. 
weaknesses: sometimes during monitoring hours, it can feel very factor farm like with all the women waiting. Modern offices, always rannon time. They had very good hours for monitoring which fit in well with work. 

They weren’t able to do procedurea in this office ao they were always done at the main offices in Manhattan. Seemed efficient. Downtown location was smaller so was pretty quick and easy I absolutely adored Dr. Lederman and the staff in his off site office. However, the main offices of RMA were not so great. The offices were clean and all, but the staff at the West Side office weren't warm and welcoming. The Mt. Kisco office and East Side NYC offices had really great, kind, compassionate, and caring staff members, which was much appreciated. They always made sure things ran smoothly and got you in and out as fast as possible. They are very organized and everyone is kind and helpful. We did not have any complaints. It's large and not very private- i understood that there was a ""factory-like"" element to the clinic but i was pleasantly surprised by the compassion and effort and time I was given.Very thorough,  gave instructions clearly and in and understansavle fashionIt was always extremely busy, but I was always seen pretty quickly- within an hour of arrival.  Get to the office early for ultrasounds, expect to wait. I do wish the clinic had an easy way to acces records online. Betas, pregnancy tests, etc They were totally on top of everything. They helped me emotionally as well.  Very busy place but they know what they are doing. Multiple offices made monitoring easy. All staff are accessible by email. Working out financial issues was time consuming   Overall very well run officeAll very kind, but busy. They were responsive but not overly. Pro: high success rate
Con: not personal, long wait time, rarely see same doc I think the waiting room in any of these places is a really tough place to be.  For me it felt like we were all in a big competition for the same babies, and that was grueling.  Keep your head down in the waiting rooms and try to not pay attention to anyone else.  i felt like i wanted more support from the nursing staff than i got efficient, well-oiled machineWhitney is the best! The waiting room is a little awkward It's like a factory during monitoring hours, otherwise it's clean and the staff is friendly and competent I thought they were always excellent, responsive, and flexible with timing (since I was almost always way late and they always accommodated)99 percent of the time, the nursing staff was amazing. I learned to request specific nurses for bloodwork as my veins are difficult. Liza and Sima were the only ones who could get my blood painlessly every time. My one negative experience was during my first cycle. I was not responding as well as we had hoped to the medication and it looked like I was not going to get very many eggs. I was sobbing in the nurses office and she was not at all compassionate and basically just suggested we try another round. We were paying out of pocket and at the time could not afford another round so that was not at all helpful. Strengths: it’s small and intimate. You are given a coordinator and nurse for directly gives you all there attention and go step by step with you through this process.  They made sure you had everything you needed for the process in time. By my 3rd iui I felt the team was disorganized. I had to remind them once to put in my prescription. No sensitivity on the phone. I think RMA is the best clinic in NYC.  Second is maybe Weil.  There are star doctors at each.  Dr. Stein is one of the best doctors at RMA so he has a ton of patients.  Nothing in this process is easy but it can really help if you have faith in your doctor and the lab. RMA has a lot of patients overall but I found the third party experience to be very personalized, which it should be, given the financial investment.  I didn't pay too much attention to what the waiting room looked like as far as physical bodies waiting for monitoring by the time I reached this point and was more concerned about the actual level of care.it was evident that the nursing staff was extremely busy and did not really have the time to be attentive and provide exceptional one on one care, but that was fine because I was in a rush most mornings when I was there and didn't feel the need to stop and chat for an extended period of time Some people might feel that RMA has a factory feel because of their mechanical efficiency. However, for me who works during the day, this efficient approach was very practical and worked well with my schedule.Monitoring hours are amazing and helped me not have to take time off of work.Great clinic with amazing doctors and staff. We were a bit unhappy with the way the billing department handled our second round of IVF treatment. We explained we were waiting on approval of the loan (by the credit agency referred to us by RMA) and they threatened to suspend our cycle if we didn’t make the payment even though we had gone through one cycle already paying in full. Other than that, it was a pleasant experience, I just felt that was a little extreme given the already existing stress caused by going through IVF in the first place. In person, all of the nurses were lovely, helpful, and patient. Over the phone, a few were less informative and patient at times. But overall, very good.Some phlebotomists were not as good as others (you become an expert when you have blood drawn so often. It was more painful with some and left bruising than with others). It was busy at the Madison Avenue location, so the staff wasn't always super friendly. It wasn't communicated that you need to check out. We had access to a nutritionist and a counselor.  It was always easy to get in touch with billing with our many questions.  This place is busy, especially east side - but don't mistake it for a haphazard baby factory.  They truly are the #1 place for fertility issues and I trusted them implicitly.  We highly recommend Dr. Stein and RMANY!!!Monitoring hours were very convenient, starting at 7am. Process was organized and efficient. Never had a problem, or a long wait.Efficient!Organized, efficient, straight forward and responsive. The monitoring hours are busy, but they have it down to a science and always treat you individually and not just like a number in the mornings. I would highly recommend the practice to friends. Felt efficient, though some mornings (especially on the weekends) were crowded. Get there early!The waiting room could definitely be improved in terms of atmosphere and furniture but don't let that turn you off. Sometimes classical music would be playing today's top hits and I really liked that when it was on. The colors in the waiting room were a little dark and dreary. Sometimes the phlebotomist didn't introduce themselves by name but kindly greeted me as I went back for blood work. My very first visit was a little confusing as I had never been to a monitoring appointment before and didn't know the process / what to expect and I didn't receive instructions from the front desk check in coordinators when you sign in. I think that all new patients that come in for their first monitoring appointment should be told what to expect and what the process entails (sign your name on the sticker with your doctors name, sit in the waiting room until your name is called by a nurse, go back and get your blood work done, go back into the waiting room and wait to be called for your ultrasound, following the ultrasound go to the check out desk and formally check out and speak with a billing coordinator.) I had to self navigate my first appointment but after the initial monitoring appointment I got the hang of things in terms of the process. The nurses were always very pleasant. The billing coordinators required retraining in terms of how to speak to patients compassionately during check out. I made RMA NY aware of this immediately and shortly after I provided this feedback the billing coordinator experience improved drastically. At the end of the day, all I cared about was that I was under the care and supervision of Dr. Copperman and his team. Go to your monitoring appointment at 6:50 - 7AM - the early bird gets the worm and there are way less patients there and you get in and get right out!RMA is, for the most part, extremely organized. I felt well-cared for 99% of the time - nurses always called when the said they would, I never had to wait longer than 10 minutes for monitoring (and that would be when the waiting room was packed!), and everyone really seems to know what they're doing. Every fellow/doctor I saw while monitoring was incredible, and the people who performed my retrieval seemed great. Very pleased with the outcome of the cycle, and I'm sure I have to credit the clinic and the doctors/embryologists for their great work. That said - it is a big place. As I mentioned earlier, if  your situation is slightly out of the ordinary and you need to work across a few teams, it sometimes feels like you need to stay on top of everyone. I was a little surprised that it took nurses/coordinators a while to realize that I was waiting for their next steps, only to learn they all thought I was in touch with one of them the whole time. You do need to be organized with multiple teams. If you're just working with one coordinator though, I think RMA has it fully in hand.Lots of locations, usually not a bad wait for monitoring. The clinic is big so you don’t get any hand holding. Do your own research or be prepared to assert yourself quite a bit to understand treatment protocols.The main problem is just that I wish they were open for more hours in the day!  They only do many procedures between 9am and 12:30 which isn't always convenient.  The nurses always call back when  I call.  I have gotten some conflicting information from some nurses, but they quickly cleared up their miscommunication.Strength- they are open early for monitoring. The staff are all pleasant and approachable. The waiting time is not that bad if you arrive at the clinic as they are opening. The coffee machine is a major plus. The clinic is well kept and clean. All the staff here was very nice and seemed to be on top of things.  The front desk staff are great, they are fast to check you in and have your chart available to help facilitate.  The nurses and other doctors all seem to be on the same team and when I had to see another doctor instead of Dr. Stein, that doctor seemed to know me and my treatment.  The only department I was thrilled with is the billing dept (but they have to work with insurance companies, so I get it) but I had to double check a few things with them and not sure they had my financial interest in mind.The clinic sees many people through the day, sometimes making for a full waiting room.  However, the staff are rather quick to see everyone, provide a calming environment to sit and wait, and have never waited for longer than 15 minutes for monitoring.The main office is in midtown Manhattan is the only clinic open during weekends and holidays, which was inconvenient for me on the rare occasion when I needed morning monitoring during the weekend.  Otherwise, the staff is pleasant and friendly, phone calls and emails are always returned, and the office is clean. I felt it was well oiled. You were taken in the order you came. Some days were busier than others while some were quieter. I do wish the monitoring hours were a little longer but I do understand it is time sensitive so they do need to get the samples to the lab. The clinic is clean and organized. The staff wore gloves when doing procedures or drawing blood. The place was sanitary including the bathroom. The location of the office was easy to get to and the office was easy to find. I don’t think I have any weaknesses to include. Overall, we had a great experience at RMA. Everyone from the front desk team to the nurses to all of the doctors are professional, kind and caring. The clinic has a great reputation and I know a number of friends who have experienced success there as well. The only drawback is that depending on the time that you arrive for monitoring hours, it can be a bit of a wait. A lot of people go to this clinic because its one of the best in the city. Sometimes it might feel like you might be a number to the doctor but the Care coordinator and nurses help bridge the gap. The only weakness I saw was at RMA eastside which is their main office didn't give me accurate information on the results of one of my procedures at first but then someone called with updated info later that day. I mostly went to the Westside office except for Saturdays and for the procedures that are conducted there. For any new patient i recommend first asking questions before the initial consultation to see which doctor are at the office during a day of the week you can work around if you have a job. There are doctors that are only there during certain days of the week. Monitoring rooms and machines were clean and well functioning. The main negative side was the lengthy wait, not only due to the number of people ahead of me, but due to dr. Sandler having one on one discussions with his fellows during monitoring hours which in one occasion resulted in making me (and other patients) wait 1.5 hrs.Strengths: brilliant doctors and their teams, communication is amazing, space is clean, staff is friendly, open 364 days a year. 

Weakness: Your doctor might not do your retrieval and IUI’s. If doing IVF they will do your implant and pregnancy ultrasounds. Must go to Eastside office on weekends and it’s crowded—get there early!I've read in other reviews that RMA runs like an oiled machine and they are spot on with that! RMA team are very efficient and the process ran so smoothly. Everyone I dealt with was nice. The office/waiting rooms especially in Manhatthan can get crowded, however,  I never felt that I  nor my needs were not important- I always felt I was in good hands.When you leave RMA you have the lingering sense of ""quantity over quality."" I felt most times I was in the office for monitoring that I was part of a cattle-call. they also overcharge patients and are very slow to reimburse for overcharges.The doctors are great clinicians and very responsive. Same with the nurses. Yes, there are a large number of patients in the morning during monitoring hours however the clinic does a great job of keeping organized and making sure you’re informed  about all results in a timely fashion. The one thing I did not like about the clinic was the billing department . They sent bills a year and half after I was discharged from the clinic for amounts that had been paid by my insurance already. Specifically Destiny C from their collections department called me saying I would be sent to collections for the amount and I called my insurance  and found out The bill was paid by them and they I was being illegally charged for itConvenient locations and streamlined processes.  You are 1 or 1,000.  Specialized care and extra time for treatment is not really possible.  Overall all doctors are professional, but it is frustrating when you don't really feel that they've had time to read your file. Other than a phone issue a few times, the office itself is very clean, organized, and relaxing. The staff is also very nice. The front desk staff is amazingly calm and soft-spoken(even if they are actually stressed out). The only weakness I would say at this point is the hours. They close by 3:30 pm and they are only open from Monday through Friday (Garden City location), but they do have other locations that have weekend hours. It's just a bit further out of our way as we travel from Queens. The clinic treats a lot of women-mostly because they take a great amount of health insurance plans-which is excellent.  While there are so many people present for monitoring and appointments, I feel very taken care of when I am the patient in the chair being seen. All of my questions have been answered and all staff, doctors and nurses have all been helpful, supportive and empathic during the process. RMA is a factory and we are all just a number. There is no link between IVF coordinators and finance which resulted in miscommunication between them to me, and I had to pay for my first cycle out of pocket as we were still waiting for insurance approval. There have been other instances where a nurse called and told me to ""take the trigger tonight, and see you on Sunday for the IUI"" without mention of timing for either! When selecting RMA, I noticed that some of the their reviews and feedback online described it as a factory. This was not my experience at all. Everyone there was incredibly nice, patient, and professional. The blood team always was so kind and sweet, giving me there warm wishes that everything would work out for me. The clinic could not have been nicer.  Although it was busy at times, that is something you just have to accept as part of the process. I was never there more than an hour during screens, and on average I was there for a half hour.

I truly cannot think of any weaknesses of the clinic.

Every doctor I met would incredibly smart and had a great bedside manner.  The biggest problem or RMA is communication. There is no patient portal and you can only get partial verbal information from a phone call from a nurse. RMA does not provide a consistent treatment procedure. The experiences are very different based on your doctor and nurse. I think some of the nurses who take blood tests need to be better trained - I've had a few instances where the blood draws have been painful/difficult. While it does have a ""factory"" feel it is SO efficient and I rarely wait more than 15 minutes for any appointment, which says a lot in New York City. Everyone is kind, smiles when you walk in, and I truly believe they try to make you feel as comfortable as possible. The strengths are in the ease of use, the medical acumen, the relatively low cost, and the results. (We have an 11 day old son. And the pregnancy was totally uneventful in a good way.)

The weakness is that there is always a new face. We saw our doctor plenty but not even every other visit. You just have to be okay with that. Monitoring was awful.  A room full of dozens of women waiting to be seen.  Wait times were erratic.  Sometimes it was 10 minutes, sometimes it was an hour and 10 minutes.At times in the process you can definitely feel that RMA is more concerned with their own stats than your individual patient case. They are rigid in their standards (which are top notch) but sometimes to a fault. Very busy clinic, lines and wait time can get long especially on the weekend when other RMA's office are closed. get there early for monitoring and be patient. Numbers bring strength too they get to see a lot of people and a lot of experiences, yet for DOR/AMA they have the same approach.IF you're new to this, get info before your first visit so you can ask questions that matter. Their admin staff has been excellent with me, especially finance and clinical coordinator.The main strength is that this clinic was open on weekends and holidays which was a huge advantage because most of my IUIs ended up falling on weekends. They take the time sensitivity of these procedures seriously.  However you see a different doctor every time as a result. Their success rates are also high but so are their prices. Well oiled machine. In and out within 20-30 mins. Even though our doctor is at the Westside clinic, we were able to do monitoring at the Brooklyn clinic which was much more convenient.The strengths - RMA clinical team includes financial resources (if you have insurance, they will do all of the calls for your benefits, bills, authorization for medications). All you have to do is call to authorize your insurance for the IVF benefit. They do have an organized system. However, at times that same organization is a detriment. RMA treats you like a number. On one of my retrieval cycles, a new Dr (I had never met before) did my retrieval. He barely introduced himself to me. Then after the procedure was done, I had to ask multiple times for Tylenol to treat the pain and for the oocyte count. In addition, the nurses rushed me out while I still felt groggy and confused from the anesthesia. On another visit, a transfer cycle - I requested to transfer 2 embryos. The dr. nearly bit my head off, he was nasty/short. It made the rest of the transfer an uncomfortable experience and hard to relax after. strength: doesn't make you feel like just a number, overall the employees are pleasant.
weakness: if you need to do monitoring on the weekend, you'd need to travel into Manhattan.  Egg retrieval and transfers are in Manhattan as well which can be inconvenient.The clinic is located in an accessible location, has staff that is easy to talk to - from the nurses, billing, to the lab and doctors. The waiting room could sometimes feel crowded but they have recently made significant improvements in the environment and also in the speed of service.I see Dr Sekhon at the Downtown location. Its small and never overcrowded. I get in and out of the office quickly. Monitoring hours could be a little earlier. 7:30 is a little late. I have heard the midtown east location can be a bit of a cattle call, but I think that is true for just about every practice at the larger locations. The receptionist at the downtown location could brush up on her people skills a little. She's not the best and could be friendlier. They have several offices that are clean and well maintained, which is a strength. They do not have a good communication system, there is no where to speak with the doctor directly. The nurses always call back if you have a question, which is fine for some things but sometimes you just need to talk to your doctor. And when the nurse calls back, it may not be the same nurse each time. I have met with my ""primary nurse"" about once since 2016 and when speaking to her on the phone, she comes off as very dismissive. Another strength are the women that sit in the front, as they seem much more personable and help with the ease of checking out of the office after your visit. RMA is a great place. It has a good energy, there is never a long wait time, there is always tons of patients there. I think because it is a franchise, it definitely has more of a one size fits all approach. So if your case is complicated in anyway, I am not sure if this is the place.strengths: they are well practiced, and well coordinated in terms of how they work - it's a pretty well oiled machine

but this also is their biggest weakness: they are a machine. It was really easy to feel like a number vs. a patient who's heart is on the line.RMA NY was very organized! I've been to other large clinics that operate in a similar way (eg factory style monitoring hours), but never felt the others were as organized and on top of things as RMA. They called my prescriptions in in a timely manner, were very detailed in their daily instructions and blood work results. I felt like I was taken care of. The only downside (which didn't bother me) is that it can get quite busy during monitoring hours. But because they are so organized, and have the s$!t together, it didn't bother me. The clinic in White Plains does not have rooms for male partners to provide samples. They expect you to provide a sample at home and then bring it with you to the clinic. It was awkward to say the least to go through that since we live almost 50 minutes away from the clinic. Otherwise, the space is fine.
RMA overall gives military discounts, which I appreciate so much. Tricare (military insurance) does not cover IVF or any IVF medications, so it was a huge financial strain on us to do it. But with the discount, it made it much more affordable, and I appreciate them giving it.RMA is definitely a factory.  But it's a well oiled factory.  During the week I'd go to the West side office and the wait was really hit or miss.  Sometime I'd show up at 8am and be out in 15min.  Sometimes I'd show up at 8am and wait 45min to be seen.  On the weekends you must go to the east side office.  This was usually very crowded with wait times of 1hr +.  Thorough care for my husband and myself. RMA is a well-oiled machine, and are clearly excellent in their care. The communication between the doctors is fantastic, I’m informed of all steps of the process by our doctors and their staff, and all questions I have are answered. The offices are clean and well-staffed. We haven’t had to wait long at any appointments. Staff training is very hands on, and RMA has obviously high standards in choosing employees. Efficient on weekdays at the Westchester location.  Terrible cattle-call on the weekends at the Madison Ave location.I went to the Brooklyn clinic as it is smaller compared to the other locations and that is primary location for the MD. I liked that its a smaller office and staff and it doesn't make you feel like you're another number. I wasn't comfortable in the huge waiting room where I felt like I might run into people I know; I wish they offered some private areas. Dr. Copperman's coordinator's were really kind and available. I appreciated that. Any staff member I interacted with was compassionate and considerate. I felt like I could ask questions, and also, I felt like I could reach a real person when I needed to. It was as pleasant as dealing with infertility could be.Clinical strength of the team and also having a patient coordinator gave me 100% confidence and took the stress away. Weakness is you always see different Drs and the weekend waits are bad, plus the men can take the patients chairs! That needs sorting out.RMA has a great selection of Dr's and great team of personnel who is personable and caring during your Infertility treatments. I was treated like a person and not a number at all the stages of my IVF journey and at each clinic I visited for monitoring/retrieval/transfer.I was not a ""typical"" patient of this clinic because I was being seen as a professional favor to my OBGYN. However, the staff was very helpful and friendly. I'm unsure if it was the case with all patients but I think the hours were a bit limited. The earliest I could get there was 7am, which wasn't always convenient.RMA of NY can be very crowded especially in the monitoring hours. They also have a urologist in site and whenever we saw him for my husband, we are in the waiting area with other people. They don't have a separate waiting room for patients which appointments. The site in the east side (59th St) could be very busy and sometimes we have to go to the West side for some test which is not convenient for us. Sometimes, also the wait for the monitoring hours could be long especially if you arrive after 7:30 am (they start 7 am). What I really like though with RMA is that they have 1 number for all your concerns - urgent matters, appointments, talking to your nurse); there will always be someone at the other end especially during office hours. They really need to work on making patients feel like people. Having fertility issues is devasting and everyone just lacks compassion. The place feels like a baby making assembly line. I also feel I was kind of pushed to PSG testing. They didn't really talk to me about it. I just got a bill that said I was doing IVF with PGS. I thought it was what the doctor thought was best for me but I'm pretty sure that's how they keep their stats up.RMA has very good doctors--but the entire approach of the clinic is to do large numbers of IVF  and egg freezing cycles without little care for the patient.  It is very difficult to arrange for a one-on-one conversation with the doctor or nursing staff.  I felt like a number during my egg freezing cycle and when I returned to the clinic to use my frozen eggs -- which did not yield any usable embryos.  The clinic is also very challenging to work with concerning billing. Even though my insurance provider covers IVF, RMA required me to pay the clinic directly for certain procedures, which forced me to seek reimbursement from my insurance company.  On one occasion, the doctor recommended that I take a certain test; the RMA billing staff indicated that because they could not guarantee that my insurance company (CIGNA) would cover it, I would just have to pay for the cost directly I was disappointed that RMA, as a clinic that works on a daily basis with CIGNA, would not facilitate my access to IVF coverage by discussing my need for this test with the insurance provider. This was just one example of many by which the clinic conveys that all it cares about is your money, rather than whether the services provided yield the patient the best chance at having a healthy, live baby.It is a high-traffic, impersonal clinic.  I changed to the RMA Brooklyn clinic as soon as I possibly could, as it is much smaller and the nurses/employees were much more warm and actually remembered me between monitoring appointments.Yes, a lot of people will tell you RMA is a factory. But the truth is, that's a good thing in the sense that it moves quickly and they're efficient. 
Despite all that, the staff is amazing. They're always smiling, caring, ready to help, listen and all. As weird as it sounds, I always enjoy going there. 
You'll see many different doctors during the monitoring, and they're all very nice and professional. However, every step will be provided by your doctor and his team. Most of my monitoring is done remotely as I live of out state, however when I have gone to appointments at RMA the offices are always clean and staff are friendly. The Manhattan – Eastside office is particularly busy and can be a bit overwhelming during monitoring hours but their process is very efficient which helps.The Brooklyn office is warm, faster, and generally smaller - making it a more ideal location. The main office on Madision Ave of RMA is a giant cog machine that routes people through as numbers not faces and it is a factory. The wait was short and the receptionist was friendly. I ended up receiving a bill accidentally, but once I called they corrected everything. The financial coordinator seemed a bit uncomfortable while speaking to my husband and I . She asked us several times if we had an questions. We met with three different people from theee different departments which was overwhelming for me. Hours are 7-8:30 at West Side office. It's a much smaller office than the East side, so it feel more intimate. Technicians are very efficient and quick. It's a well run operation. If you go only  for bloodwork, it's pretty quick. If you also have ultrasound it's a bit more time but not too much more.This is a big place that takes insurance. The coordinator who I worked with was very attentive and helpful. 
But the size and cookie-cutter nature make this clinic a poor place for older women with egg quality issues.They are amazingly efficient! If you go in the morning, you'll be out in less than 30 minutes! Mondays are a little hectic, but otherwise, it's great. When I started, they didn't take my insurance, but that changed about a month in. I was a little apprehensive when I went for the first time since all of the reviews were from people who were a little further along in their fertility journey. Everyone at the clinic is friendly and efficient, and I also recommend it to someone who may be earlier in the process or have unexplained infertility.I think the clinic is designed as a well oiled machine. They have a process that allows you to go in early in the morning for monitoring and you will get the responses later in the afternoon. The clinic where you have the procedures it's ok, not impressive but has everything that they need to perform the job.Strengths - thorough, efficient, multiple locations, everyone works together, very clear financial information
Weaknesses - everything is done at the Madison Avenue location on weekends and it can be very busy with a bit of a waitRMA is a factory - again, this isn’t necessarily a bad thing but it does mean you won’t get personalized care and you MUST stay on top of your own treatment and be your own advocate. There were multiple oversights in terms of my care and I was tested for things (that could have negatively impacted treatment success and turns out I had) only because I insisted on doing so.I think like most clinics there is a wait during monitoring hours. It could be as little as few minutes and as long as 30/45 minutes. If you come very early then usually there are no issue with the wait. I personally was not bothered by this so the best advise that I would give to a new patient is to expect it or at least try to work around it by coming in very early. At the end of the day its worth it and if you have many good books on your ""to read list"" this would be a good opportunity to catch up. You should be aware that this is a very large practice and there will be times when you might feel like a number rather than a patient. However, a crowded waiting room does not mean that you are part of a conveyor belt, once you are behind the scenes, our treatment always seemed very personal. A large practice gives many pluses and minuses, and you should think about what you are comfortable. RMA is a bit of a factory but it is convenient with quick monitoring hours available all over the city. And I have found the other doctors at RMA that I have seen during monitoring, egg retrieval, and FET transfer to be overwhelming competent and warm which is nice because you don't always get to do procedures with your doctor. It is also great that they call you with results / directions and then email them as well so you don't have to be worried if you didn't catch everything. RMA is run efficiently . There are several locations in Manhattan , Brooklyn and Westchester so it’s convenient for people in various locations in the city .  However the monitoring hours should be a bit more flexible .  The strict monitoring hours makes it difficult to rearrange your schedule depending on the type of job you have . When you enter RMA , the clinic seems to be run like a well oiled machine .  Everyone is seen efficiently and that’s wonderful when you are in a rush to go to work at then end of your appointment. However with that being said , it feels like a factory with a lack of compassion from the doctors  responsible for your care . Return callls from the nurses take place within a few hours or by the end of the day .  There are so many doctors on staff so getting in touch with your doctor may be difficult .  My wish would be for a direct line to your doctor’s officers prevent going through the message answering protocol .RMA is a baby factor. It is often highly difficult to get someone on the phone, and even harder to get a call back. While my doctor treated me as an individual, the clinic absolutely makes you feel like an impersonal number. It can be very frustrating and upsetting not to feel valued. Specifically regarding the Long Island office, I have always had a pleasant experience.Very efficient. Its probably not the environment for everyone. It’s in the city so sometimes morning bloodwork was packed and it felt like a cattle call - but staff was always helpful, polite and kind. Not everyone taking blood is good at it, but there are a few rock stars that can get blood from the worst of arms. All the monitoring hours are in the morning before work, but the earlier you go the better. RMA downtown is a smaller practice so much better wait time and smoother experience. RMA East is their main office and incredibly busy. They definitely see pts who are bloodwork/ultrasound before those who are just bloodwork. There needs to be a Better review after failed IUIs. There was no difference between any of my IUIs. 
One positive is that results came back quickly, same day if you made the monitoring hours.
Expect to be stressed on making monitoring hours in the morning if you are working. 
I also would ask for a better communication on finances. My co pays were all over the place and there was no consistency on paying for procedures RMA of New York definitely has a system down. It's easy to feel like a number at this clinic, but they ARE pretty organized. While I got used to seeing a different doctor every time I went in for monitoring, one thing I did not like about RMA was that the actual procedures (IUI and IVF egg retrieval) were also performed by whatever doctor was on duty that day. There was one doctor at RMA that I didn't particularly care for (his bedside manner was not a match for me) that did one of my IUI's, and I would never have actually chosen him to do it. At RMA, you are very limited when it comes to choice in that sense. I didn't even SEE the doctor who did my IVF egg retrieval. I was already under anesthesia before he even came into the room. Overall, I've had a good experience at RMA (despite my treatment failures).Having worked with another clinic and doctor before I switched to RMA I. Genuinely can't think of many or any weaknesses - after my first APPT  I told my friend and family that it was a totally different ( positive ) experience . You are in good hands ! And it's great that all the whiteplains, nyc and Long Island offices all work in conjunction with each other RMA was recommended to me many times, via Facebook, via friends, etc. so I went with them. They seemed professional, but definitely it felt like a factory there, and a little disorganized. The waiting room was a bit depressing; I think for your first cycle, things are overwhelming always and for subsequent cycles, you get used to things more. I thought the nurses who gave the bloodtests were super pro; the doctors giving the ultrasounds for monitoring always seemed in a rush though they were professional, but I remember the first time I went for monitoring, they didn't even instruct me on what I should do next or even if I could wipe myself off with what materials and what to do with the gown...they just left me there. Luckily my partner was there. It didn't feel like a particularly nurturing environment. But I talked to a friend who had had success with IVF and that did help because she warned me about the factory feeling.Some days the waiting room was busier than others but you could always tell that the support staff was moving through the patients as quickly as they could. I hated the fact that I had to go to the city for retrieval and transfer. But most people were warm and encouraging. They got you in and out quickly, but sometimes you had to wait for the person ahead of you to be done. This is a trying time for everyone, it would be good if the staff could be a bit more encouraging and have more answers to questions. 
It was a cattle call. Getting there really early was the best way to avoid a very long wait. RMA seemed pretty organized and well run, most of appointments are on schedule.  I wish they give me more clear answer on the state run grant's availability. I follow up many times on the status and I always get respond that they do not have a contract signed with the grant yet.RMA is a strong clinic and well organized. It is huge, and they do a good job of managing individual cases. They always return phone calls within the hour.
It does feel like a bit of a factory given the size.
They are also fairly conservative/traditional. They do not believe in immunology issues and are not particularly open/imaginative about understanding RPL. They are very evidence-based, which is not a bad thing, but I do wonder since other places are more open to experimental treatments! Having now gone to another practice, I see that RMA is a fertility factory.  In retrospect, I feel that we didn't truly receive any personalized treatment.  There is a standard set of tools that RMA uses without going deep on what the underlying issue might be.  After 2 failed IVF cycles based on getting no PGC testing embryos, a panel of the RMA doctors didn't have any other suggestions beyond a different IVF protocol.  They are not open to day 3 transfers.  Since transferring to a different practice, we've done secondary tests for genetics, a biopsy identifying an infection, sperm fragmentation test and uncovered issues with each of these.  These tests just were not available at RMA.  We now think of RMA as a place to go to have certain procedures administered to you, but I don't think about it as a place where your doctor can truly ""treat"" you by offering individualized care and service. Only negative is financial coordinator, Hera or Hema or something like that, was not easy to get in touch with and was quite unclear in her communication. Everyone else  was lovely and compassionate, especially nurses who educate you on trigger shots and Kristen, Sandler’s IVF coordinator. The clinic usually responds quickly to questions. They typically contact by phone, which could be tough while I was at work and involved a lot of phone tag. I asked to be emailed and that made things much easier. There are several locations that you can go to for monitoring hours, but this was not always clear, so just ask.RMA (east side) definitely feels like a baby factory.  However, my feelings about this are positive.  The fact that so many people go there is because it works.  They have incredible resources because of the number of patients they see.  Ultimately I wanted a place with good success rates and RMA has that. 

Sure, it can feel disheartening to sit in a waiting room with so many other couples, often this is what attributes patients feeling like a number, but for me it helped me to not feel so alone sitting among so many other hopeful parents.RMA is a factory, like most of the clinics in NYC. I found it clean and efficient but always busy. Always a wait during monitoring hours. I am not sure if other doctors are like Dr. Mukhergee but if you are not an easy case or want someone to pay attention to your care and not make you feel like he has somewhere better to be- then don't go to Dr. Mukhergee. I think the clinics strengths are their staffing and knowledge.  In this type of situation you want to feel like people care and I did feel as if they all cared.  When I had to go to the New York City for monitoring, it is a bit different.  That was more like a factory of getting you in and out, but I think that is good because you want to get in and out, especially if you are just there for blood.  When I saw a doctor there, he was great and treated me as a patient, not a number.  I do prefer the small office though.  I highly recommend RMANY.Strengths - Excellent doctors, good lab providing results on same day, great team of staff who are available all days of week and very friendly, very comfortable monitoring hours accommodates working people, doctor and nurses available via. email or call for answering any questions, immediate attention and treatment when required.    
I did not come across any particular weakness, however I feel the finance team has a chance to improve with respect to coordinating with the medical team in case of changes during the treatment and sending the receipts after payment.  Monitoring hours were 7:30-9:30. Sometimes the wait was 45 minutes other times it was 10-20 minutes. You can get your blood drawn at other offices if needed which was convenient. But you have to go to the Madison office for all procedures done, IUI, IVF, etc. strengths- relatively short wait times, organized staff, timely, treated like a human not a number, encrypted email system that makes communication easier, competent doctors and nurses, had successful treatment

weakness- one of the phlebotomists didn't use gloves; one of the receptionists needs to keep patient details more discreet and make sure to follow HIPAA rulesOne large plus to RMA was their early monitoring hours, so it would not interfere with my work schedule. We found if we got there early it would go rather quickly. The nursing staff always had a smile and were very gentle. The IVF and financial coordinators were always quick to respond to emails. 
I love RMA. It's a big group proactive and you might not see your actual doctor much. But I loved all the other doctors I saw. In particular Dr Davis at the soho location It's a factory. Be prepared to be told you're infertile and only they can help.The nurses were mostly rude and unresponsive to questions. I was in touch with two of them via email- one of them wouldn't respond to my emails or phone calls and then would lie about having left me VMs.
It was a very unpleasant experience. Very organized nurses and staff, polite front desk personnel.
Waits could be very long.
Educate yourself before your first visit.Strengths: friendly and calm staff
Weakness: It took a while for the RMA Urologist's Nurse to call me back with my husbands test results of why we were not conceiving.  It could have been because my husband was their contact and not me, but we sorted that out and I got in touch with the urology team.
*Urologist is Natan Bar-ChamaThis clinic sees a lot of patients. If your concern is efficiency and you don't require personalized attention or protocols then this place is fine. The monitoring hours are good. There are several locations so monitoring isn't so much a chore. They work with several pharmacies that offer good prices, some which will even deliver your meds to you. They get you in and out so you can get to work on time. If you're expecting to talk to someone as a matter of course in your treatment, or to see the same person throughout your treatment, this is not the place for you. I think the clinic is reputable so I have comfort in the level of care I'd receive. However, because the clinic is well-known in the area, I am one of many patients there so a new patient would not feel like she will receive individual attention and care that she deserves.well oiled machine but factory like in that theres a lot of people. I personally don't mind that it's like a factory because Dr. Flisser always makes an effort to see and treat his patients. RMA Madison Ave. branch is very crowded (especially during morning monitoring hours), but it is still clean and well organized. All staff from doctors, nurses, and assistants are kind and responsive to any request. Strengths:  big, well run organization; great stats; excellent care.
Weaknesses:  it's huge and so can feel like a factory.  Sometimes the waits for monitoring on weekends can be obscene.  Finance department was not great. Not responsive unless they were calling you for payment. Inflexible and not informed / empowered to deal with non-standard requests. Monitoring was efficient and well run. The old ladies who do bloods at RMANY east clinic are amazing - barely felt anything! I prayed one of the two ladies called my name! 
Cycle coordinators: briefly dealt with One (Dr Mukherjee’s) who was super organised and communicative. I wish she had kept my case. But I changed Drs after one consult (incidentally, the transfer was smooth) and Dr Copperman’s cycle coordinator was not organised, not a good communicator and not very responsive. 
Monitoring hours are set in the morning and there are quite a few people there. It was nothing that really bothered me though -- just kind of felt like part of the process.I've been to 3 locations (Westside, Soho, and Madison Ave) and all have been clean and organized which are the first things I look for. The staff is amazing at all 3 locations. The wait is usually between 30 mins - an hour but it goes fast considering how many people they see.Strengths: They get results, efficient, and have enough staff to handle lots of patients. They are quick with giving you results, and open 364 days a year. 
Weaknesses: Some of less experienced folks struggle with taking your blood. Expect to wait 15-20 minutes each time due to the high volume.Strengths-efficient and easy to make apnts.
Weeknesses- require an insane anount of paperwork every single time. Wish it coukd be used for life and not sign every time we have a procedure done.RMA as a whole was incredible.  Everything from the front desk, to the lab, nurses and doctors were amazing.  I always felt like they knew who I was, was met with a smile and encouraging words and support.Very big and I didn’t like going into the city on the weekends. I would have also liked 6:30am blood draws because as a teacher we have to be at work extra early. The city team was differently organized and they had a more business like mindset. This is a factory setting clinic. There is often very long waits during monitoring. Do not expect to see your doctor during monitoring visits. The doctors were all pleasant overall but I prefer seeing my own doctor throughout this process which was impossible. You also need to be on top of you test results..etc because they forget to call you.Strengths are experience, organization, coordination.  Weaknesses are that it can feel a bit impersonal. As mentioned, this office is small, I could be the first person seen if I got there by 7:15 (they open the doors at 7:30). Things ran quickly and smoothly. Never really got very crowded. Strengths:  Lots of great doctors, great results, knowledgeable staff, helpful with understanding benefits and helping to obtain discounts.
Weaknesses: Won't baby you (I don't think this is necessarily a weakness), there are a lot of women there so morning monitoring can definitely feel like a factory.Pros: The ladies at the front desk are very nice and friendly, as are all the nurses during monitoring hours.  The clinic is very organized considering the volume of people coming through there everyday.  They always called when they said they would with instructions for the next day and followed up with an email with the exact instructions.  The nurses were very available for questions.  You'd have to leave a message with the front desk, but a nurse would call you back, even after hours.  
Cons: There are a LOT of patients in and out each day.  The waiting time for monitoring hours can be long.  If you arrive a few minutes before they open at 7am, that's your best bet for a short wait time.  My only minor complaint about this clinic is that the major procedures have to be done in New York City. I initially picked the clinic because of its location. I also would have preferred that my doctor personally do my egg retrieval and transfer, but I know that's probably not realistic. I will mention that any time I was seen by another doctor, mine always followed up almost immediately with a personal phone call. Strengths: Convenient location (for us), Work with our insurance (Progyny), well organized, mature setup across reception, billing, morning monitoring, IVF coordination and nursing care.

Weaknesses - I cant really think of one Rma is of course a big clinic with good success rates. From what I've read, the quality of their lab makes a big difference in their outcomes, but that's one area of the practice that we don't really see. I went to rma westside (except on weekends) and I was so pleased overall with how quickly and efficiently I was seen in the many morning appointments for monitoring. I had been so worried about missing lots of work, and I ended up not being late once, because if I got to the clinic before it opened (7am), I could literally have my blood drawn and my ultrasound done and be out the door at 7:20. Amazing! They also were very organized and never missed calling me with my instructions, which was an unfounded paranoia of mine. Rma is more impersonal because you rotate doctors and there are so many patients, but it seemed to me that they have a system that works. I think if you arrive later in the window of hours for monitoring, you probably end up with a long wait.  That happened to me once on the weekend, but at least I expected it. They really move quickly though. At rma, I definitely didn't have that feeling of knowing the nurses well, even though I went in all the time. They didn't really know me by name. But everyone was always friendly and professional, so that was a fine trade-off to me.Besides the great doctors that work there, there arent too many strengths to the clinic. Although this may not seem important, this really bothered me during my treatment - the office staff and even some nurses dressed very inappropriately for a doctors office setting. They did not represent the clinic well and it was hard to take many of the seriously. The clinic is always always crowded. I was actually surprised how quickly they get people in and out. I did really enjoy the women who did the blood tests, they were all warm and friendly!***YOU WILL ALMOST NEVER SEE YOUR DOCTOR***

While your doctor will call you with results, they will rarely--if ever-- be the person you see for monitoring or do any of your procedures.  If you need weekend monitoring there is only one office open and it is like a cattle call.  The wait can be an hour+ at times.Very pleasant and clean and comfortable. Very large, clean, and ""doctor office"" like.  Easy to get to for me which was a plus. A bit like a factory. Very nice and smart, but often felt business-like and I often wondered if I was getting the BEST protocol and price for me, or if I was just one amongst dozens of women... overall it was professional and organized. They helped a lot with finances and structure.The level of care and professionalism at RMA was appalling.  It was impossible to get a nurse on the phone, it took ages to get called back, the nurses seemed unhappy and the doctors, too.  I didn't know any better, but now I do.  Awful.Monitoring during the week wasn't too bad. Usually in and out in an hour. On the weekends they warned us that if we weren't there right when we opened we wouldn't be seen for 5+ hours which I think is unacceptable. We always came super early on the weekends so we only waited about an hour and a half. It seems like if the wait gets that long why not have more staff on hand? I hated being part of a large organization.  I felt there was no true intimacy, and it was more like a business rather than a fertility clinic.  It was very systematic, which I felt required the doctors to operate under certain guidelines, adopting a cooking cutter approach to treatment.  This was a real pain at RMA! I had to go to Midtown Manhattan for certain procedures or on the weekends which was not as convenient and monitoring hours were only early in the morning and there were always tons of women waiting. At CCRM now, it's MUCH better. You can schedule monitoring any time!You will feel like a number but it's okay -- that just means they know what they're doing. Even on days when you cannot believe how freaking packed the waiting room is, you will be in and out of there before you know it. A lot of people go there and I took that to mean that they were good. I didn't have success with them but that's because my body is wacky. too busy ,too many patients. they are greedy and just interested in getting money and billing insurance. The second (and successful) clinic I went to was Madison Women's Health on the UES.  They are AMAZING.  They are exactly what anyone would want -- individualized attention, specific nurses helping & calling everyday, great attention to detail, great bedside manner.  I felt so confident and happy with this clinic.  Clinic strengths: it's all inclusive and at one location (monitoring, transfer, retrievals are all at the same location).  The clinic can help you with financing and recommending programs to get discounts.  Also, by having so many drs, they're open every day but Christmas which is important with a process so time sensitive. 

Weaknesses: sometimes you do just feel like a number- there are so many women in and out and you see them all so you realize how many people are being treated by the practice.  Because there are so many doctors, you sometimes see one once and never again. This really seems like a for-profit operation. It's not a pleasant place to be -- dark, gloomy, cramped and not particularly clean. I don't think it's a good clinic for people with the diagnosis of diminished ovarian reserve.Strengths - offices in both Manhattan and Long Island. Most staff was friendly, and helpful. 

Weakness - the Manhattan clinic is busy, and you can wait a while for monitoring. You don't see you doctor unless he happens to be in the office on a day you are scheduled to come in. Retrievals and transfers are also done by whichever doctor is on call. Dr Copperman didn't do any of my procedures. I was with Dr. Lederman when he was part of Continum Reproduction.  All of the retrievals and transfers were done int he New York City office.  I did 9 cycles in that clinic and everyone there was great.  The nurses and embryologists were terrific.  There was not one person in either location that I could say a bad word about.  Can feel a bit like a factory at monitoring time but that's the nature of the job. I understood they had about 100 women to monitor in a two hour window, they had to move fast. The more I think about this clinic, the angry I get.  I feel it was a factory.  They didn't care about me as a patient at all.  The nurses were unhelpful.  They had ""case workers"" that seemed untrained and uneducated.  I got billed multiple times for the same thing (but luckily the woman in finance was my only ally).  When it was clear I needed to do DE, I asked for appointments and no one would call me back.  We used up all of my insurance money and then $20,000 or more of my own and I feel once they saw the cash run out, they just stopped responding.  Once I researched DE and interviewed 3 other clinics (ORM, Shady Grove and CCRM), I realized what a horrible clinic RMA NY was.  It was night and day.Screening was in the morning.  I generally tried to get there early and did not wait long.  The doctors at the East side location did not spend a lot of time with you but you could see a nurse.  In Brooklyn, the doctor would spend more time and would generally give you a lot of information about your exam and answer questions but you could also wait longer.  CATTLE CALL OVER AN HOUR WAIT EVERY MORNING.  NO WIFI!!!  NEEDS TO BE FIXED.factory.  front desk staff probably dealt with way too many hormonal women to count and now is in robot mode.all said already- weakness back in 2007, having to sign in and let everyone see your name

everything else was positiveI saw Dr. Lederman mainly in the Westchester office were everyone was  lovely and the office was in a lovely building. That office is light and bright also very clean. I came in before work which was perfect for me and usually I was seen quickly but sometimes I had to wait awhile on a busy day. The Eastside office was big and busy. I wish that office was brighter but they move quicker there because all the labs are done there.This is my second time coming back to RMA so that means something! They are a well oil machine and have been in the fertility department for a while now. The office could get busy during monitoring hours but rest assured that you will be seen. Navigating the process might be overwhelming for a new patient but there is always a nurse that you can ask if you have any concerns after a visit. The office is always clean. The staff is welcoming and  professional. Scheduling is easy. A weakness is that when I call with a question for the nurse, it usually takes quite a couple hours to hear back from them, but I do understand that they are busy.RMA is huge but each department is very organized. Monitor hours can be a bit crowded sometimes but it's good overall. The billing department is also helpful and responsive. The weakness is sometimes it's less customized but they're flexible in terms of operation schedule if you need to be out at a certain time. There are monitoring hours Monday-Sunday. You came at your convenience. First come first serve. You came to the reception area, write down your name and wait to be called first to take your blood test and then for the screening. Sometimes it could be really crowded but the staff make it that you wouldn’t spend a lot of time waiting Everyone seems knowledgeable but not great about financial support or navigating bills. Or any questions to be honest. Be prepared to have to make a huge effort to get people to talk to you, or explain things to you medically or financially.This clinic has great doctors and nursing staff. The facilities are also great and the pricing comparable to other places. The area of needed growth is in the coordinator team. They are often unavailable or appear to be frustrated with you anytime you have questions for them. Strengths: talented team, ease in protocol. Weakness: all communication is mostly via phone, vs results + instruction via e-mail, sometimes harder to get everything straight. Biggest con is far east side location. But team is overall super helpful. Generally quick turnaround for monitoring, though I've waited there once up to an hour. The clinic is nice and clean. The staff all friendly from front desk , financial , nurse.  They are informative.
The only thing is I wish the clinic can accept my insurance. Other than that I was happy with RMA..Very organized and almost always available - they run like a machine. Everyone able to access our records so no issues seeing different doctors and nurses. Sometimes hard to get in touch via phone - you call and leave a message and person may not call you back until much later in the day at an inconvenient time. Office was not completely on top of beginning the first cycle. They are fairly receptive. Every sonogram during monitoring I get a different doctor, most are fine but one is not gentle. Dr. Letterman - try not to get him.Strengths- runs like a well oiled machine. They seem to have all appointments in an appropriate time. You know what to expect when it comes to medications and appointments necessary. 
Weaknesses- sometimes you feel like a number. Ask lots of questions! I liked that RMA had different clinics for me to do my blood work, ultrasound, but only one specific clinic for IUIs, Retrieval, sperm sample, etc. It made it so much more convenient for me and my hubby for our daily routines. RMA has a good reputation, but they have such a high volume of patients, it's almost impossible to get the fully focused care that you deserve during this process. 

The billing department could use improvement with respect to organization and communication. Given the importance of removing stress during fertility treatments, worrying about billing issues is counterproductive to the process. Get to know your billing coordinator and stay on top of them.Pros: The doctors are excellent and provide great care.  They have in house blood work and the nurses always managed to get my bloodwork easily and with minimal pain.  The doctors listen to you.  
Cons: you likely won’t see your own dr for your procedure - it will likely be a stranger to you.  There are so many patients that with the clinic as a while you feel very much like a number and a statistic rather than a human.The weakness is that they have too many patients and it is hard to get a protocol that is specifically tailored to the individual patient. If you are a difficult case or their protocols do not work then they do not adjust. Their strength is that they have a very good embryo lab.Go early for monitoring, you'll go right in! They are very coordiated from admins tl nurses to doctors.
Go early for monitoring, you'll go right in! They are very coordiated from admins tl nurses to doctors.RMA is a well oiled machine.  They are open 364 days a year and monitoring hours are easy and quick.The clinic is very well run. Monitoring appointments are very convenient as the clinic opens up early. If I came by 7 am, I'd be out no later than 8 each time, which gave me plenty of time to get to work. They are pretty flexible if you run late for monitoring or need to see a nurse that day. Clinic is well organized and professional.  They informed me of the grants available through NYS and the information pertaining to IVF protocols.  They have spent time to explain the various steps of the process. Strength is that they get results. Weakness is that it is a very busy practice and it is frustrating during the monitoring process. Also when you call, if is quite difficult to speak to the doctor. You always get a nurse first.billing dept is terrible. the front staff are kind. nobody enforces the rule of ""no kids"" in the office yet, it is written in a few places. RMA downtown is fresh and clean and fast! RMA midtown is a little different and the waiting times are quite long, especially on weekends. 

The facilities for egg retrieval and transfers are great. There could be a wait if you get there at peak times, so I was always one of the first ones in the door.  I had no wait when I got there very early.I cant really comment on the clinic. I ran away pretty quickly after my cycle was canceled. There was no reason we couldnt proceed with 5 follicles. But maybe it was for there statistics. I dont know the clinic well enough. Monitoring at the downtown office was easy and efficient.  From check in to check out, it was usually less than 30 minutes (when you needed an ultrasound) and less than 15 (if it was only bloodwork).Wonderful facility on Madison Avenue. Very knowledgeable and helpful but too big to receive personal attention.Usually convenient. I was there at odd hours but could be forced to wait, especially my second experience, almost as a vendetta even if I was the first patient there. I liked the clinic because it was big enough to have all the resources but I still felt like I had individual treatment.After we decided not to go to this clinic, they still tried billing my insurance for a cycle. They did correct it after I called attention to it, but made me feel that they weren’t totally organized. One positive was the person who helped me make my appointment seemed very organized and even helped get this billing mistake fixed.This clinic is at a decent location.  There are a lot of patients that are seen here. Because of the volume of patients it is important that you keep track of all of your information etc. Following up is usually necessary because sometimes it fall through the cracks. Clinic is very busy, but very supportive and helpful. Staff were always available to answer or pass on any questions/messages. Clinic was very organized. Morning monitoring hours made it easy to continue going to work each day.The Westside clinic is clean, modern and warm. I think it is the perfect clinic. It feels inviting but not overwhelming and is set up so that you can read,  and see how monitoring hours work. It is by far the nicest clinic I have been to. Monitoring hours are really early usually between 7AM or 8:30AM, which monitoring hours could be held through the day, especially when having a job. The waiting rooms are usually packed for monitoring hours and people have to stand some days, it’s very overwhelming sometimes.Monitoring was super easy.  Hours were early which allowed minimal interruption to my work schedule, especially if you arrive early.  My first appointment at RMA was incredible. I met with not only my doctor, but the whole team. The financial consultant, my nurse, my IVF coordinator - everyone was SO helpful and gave me all of their direct contact information. Everyone is so accessible and easy to get in touch with. Very organized, efficient, always open, available to see me and take blood at flexible times, very nice staff, very friendly and comfortable.  I would have liked to have had an easier time communicating with the woman in the insurance department.It was efficient. The wait varied by morning but was always reasonable.Efficient well oiled machine. No long wait times. Nice place pretty well organized, try not to get Dr. Letterman. He was rough during sonograms. Avoid dr copperman, and stay on top of your cycle, they may not always be on it and ask questions they might not think to ask. If there are med students, feel free to say you dont want them in on meetings.Very professional, well staffed office. Always ready to help. 
Open, cleaned and well equipped. The clinic is clean, the receptionists are kind, and the nurses are compassionate.Lots of patients! Long monitoring hour lines. BUT- amazing doctors and nurses. They knew every detail of my case and run like a well oiled machine.I love the downtown RMA Office. It's clean, small, and folks are very efficient.RMA is a mill, and I believe their approach is one that will only work for easy cases.  The general refrain was ""every cycle is different,"" without specifically addressing the individual patient.  An assessment of my partner and us as a couple would also have been helpful.Variable, but usually able to get in with little wait time or difficulty. Monitoring was in the early morning. Not ideal for my schedule, but I went at the end of the window and was fine. The White Plains office is great, it's very small and you can get in and out very quickly. The NYC office is a little more clinical and like you're a number. The clinic is very large and when you have to go to NYC location it is incredibly overwhelming, plus parking is awful.The IVF coordinator was horrible. My cycle was delayed because of her lack of communication and errors. That said, the clinic did come through for me to try to make things right. I was reassigned and prioritized in my care going forward and I truly appreciated that effort.It's literally a cattle call. You wait your turn. It's fast and efficient but not personal I have no complains about the clinic. They were very well organized and always ran on time. Being an out of town patient, they were in the middle of Manhattan which provided easy access, lots of traffic during working hours but easy to accessWell oiled machine. You came in during open hours. Some days were busier than others but if you went early enough you often didnt need to wait long. The office is in a good location and the hours are convenient.  They are also open on weekends.
The office is pretty clean.  The waiting time is not too long. It is easy to schedule an appointment.  The staff is very nice and helpful.First in first out. You dont know which doctor is on duty. Somewhat rushed. If you dont get pregnant the first time dont think of it as the doctors fault it's only the first time and they have to find out what works but the second time around things should work in your favor There are lots of resources due to the size of the clinic. Larger clinics maybe more/less appealing depending on the type of patient and your needs. Doctors are very knowledgable but have very specific opinions about care. Monitoring times were usually efficient.Too big and impersonal. Too many things fell through the cracks, particularly with medications and insurance. I would wait hours for a procedure, well after the appointment time. I felt like a number. Many people come in for monitoring hours, but I never waited more than 15 minutes for an appointment. The staff is friendly and the office is kept extremely clean. All doctors are thorough and understanding. It's very busy and a lot of patients and doesn't seem like a lot of personalized protocols .....................................................................................................................................................................They mostly ran well. The weekends were the longest waits. Everyone from the elevator man up to the doctors are friendly.

The staff are friendly, always willing to help anytime you call or approach them.

The clinic is clean and has a good ambient.

The clinic is great and you will always feel at ease.Very busy- tried to get there as early as possible. Waits at westside office shorter than eastside. Weekends are a long waitNever had to really wait .. easy to make appointments .. lab results came back same day .. weaknesses is dealing with the finance office it got confusing because there were a few different girls handling my account RMA is one of the best in NYC. They are organized, friendly, clean and reliable.Strengths:  It's a smoothly run, large operation with lots of experience and data.
Weaknesses: The size can make it feel like a factory. They were early in the morning, but otherwise, easy. Very efficiently run. Great phlebotomy team. Very large practice and from time to time long waitsThe waiting area was always packed but I don't see anything that could be done about that The wait times were not crazy although I did always get there early. When I started going to Dr Copperman he was working out of Mt Sinai then moved to his own RMA on Madison. The facility was brand new.  Very kind reception and great facility. Well run and organized.Allowed children to go to appointments (except IVF) which is helpful when dealing with secondary infertility.very efficient with getting me in and out for all the lab draws and u/s
very good place for a working womanI love my clinicIt was a factory; get there as early as possible or you could be there for a long timeThe entire staff were extremely detailed oriented - from the front desk, to the nurses, to the financial consultants. Each was able to clearly explain all aspects of what we were going through to us so we felt informed the entire time. The clinic has mainly strengths. Really truly always a great experience with everyone. My only comment for them would be to make sure they explain what each med is and why it’s important. I did have one issue where I didnt realize a med had a refill, so I stopped taking it for days. Somehow I mentioned it in passing to a nurse who told me to get right back on it. Luckily everything was fine, but I think had the purpose of the med and the overall plan been explained, it might have been avoided. Honestly though they were always so great about everything I could only recommend them.RMA has helped a lot of my friends achieve pregnancy. They have an excellent reputation for helping achieve pregnancy. The only thing I would recommend is that they incorporate yoga, meditation, overall stress relieve classes in their offices. The clinic  can appear  overwhelming at first when looking at the amount  of people  waiting for monitoring. However, the wait time is very minimal and goes bye The staff are really nice and welcoming. Clinic was fine. The way they handle billing was slightly pushy. Generally good customer service. some of the staff who take blood are amateurs and every time I’d leave with bruises all over my arm.  I saw Dr. Copperman at nearly every monitoring appointment and once pregnant, he did my first ultrasound and released me personally several weeks later.  When we had a scare midway through the pregnancy (unrelated to RMA), he saw us immediately to discuss and offer his opinion even though I was technically no longer under his care and hadn't been for several weeks.One thing my husband and I found very reassuring is that all of our embryos were genetically tested before the transfer. That really gave us peace of mind that we were doing everything we could to have a healthy baby. Now we have done noninvasive prenatal testing, which RMA advised us to do because nothing in life is 100% certain, and everything came back low risk.RMA has A LOT of patients so you will likely not feel like a unique flower there. on the upside, they have done this A LOT and they know exactly what they're doing. they don't need to second guess your treatment strategy because they essentially have an algorithm that they're working off of so they know just how to approach your particular situation Very organized, never much of a wait. Runs like clock work. Monitoring hours run smoothly and can handle quite a few patients at once. Calls with results usually take place before noon which is great. RMA is a factory, which I mean in both a good and a bad way. RMA is HUGE and they've got the fertility program DOWN. You get the impression that nothing would faze them; they've got an answer and a workaround for everything. The downside is that RMA can feel like an assembly line set to run a little too fast. On multiple occasions, I'd have to remind the nurses about my test results, my medication schedule, and more. I suspect that their patient records are scribbled in crayon and filed between take-out menus, because no one seemed to have a 100% grasp of what was going on. I dealt with it by being super-organized and knowledgable about my own protocol, and if you can deal with that, you'll be fine. Only thing I disliked were the monitoring hours, they are super early, but that's only b/c I'm not a morning person. Other that that, the clinic is clean, modern,  very professional. It was close to my office so I was able to go in before work and not be inconvenienced. Perfect match!Strengths:
Great doctors and staff
Psychologist on staff to meet with you about the process and also screen donors
On site donor matching program
Responsive and caring staff
Good morning office hours

Weaknesses:
The office could use an update
I was surprised they didn't offer more holistic services or talk about that moreThe facility is clean and well taken care of. They seem to have top of the line equipment. The monitoring hours are ideal. I often came at 7:30 am for monitoring and never had to wait long at all. I often arrive to work earlier than when I didn't have monitoring. The entire staff is friendly and helpful.Strengths: Very efficient and polite.  Not sure on the weakness.  Perhaps it would be nicer if they responded to messages in a more timely manner.  Or at least try to be available immediately to converse with the patient.Sometimes it feels like a factory, but they get you through the process and are caring and compassionate, especially if you reach out for support. Advocate for yourself, ask as many questions as you can think of, try to stay ahead of what's coming up for you and make sure you have what you need (meds ordered in time, etc.).Most times the wait wasn’t long but a few times could take over an hour. RMA is an excellent fertility clinic. The structure at RMA is very efficient and effective, which works great for my busy schedule. I went to three different offices for monitoring and the services from these offices are consistent. These offices are always clean and comfortable. Many people refer to it as a factory, and it really can feel like that at ""peak"" hours, but honestly, it's a very well-run system. The facilities are very nice and clean. Everyone works very well together to keep things flowing smoothly. I would absolutely come back again if I need to. RMA Is a large practice and has a systematic approach that could feel generic at times, but they have a process that works and great organization, thoroughness and medical experience based on the large number of patients they treatThe key Clinic strengths are as follows. efficient , knowledgeable, experts 
While the are the following-Miscommunications from IVF coordinator 

Great experience and you still felt like an individual in the west side I was very impressed with RMA's friendly staff which ran on-time. The staff even works on the weekends. The practice is  trusted by many patients. Be ready for daily blood work and ultrasounds. I had a great experience and recommend RMA to everyone as it was recommended to me by my OB/GYN.Everyone at RMA was very informative, however when you needed to talk to a nurse or any other department ex- financial you had to call the main number and they always had to call you back.  They always returned my call the same day.  Monitoring was super convenient. I highly recommend that you go in right when monitoring hours open / start and you'll get right in and out of there. The phlebotomist should be taking the time to explain blood work during your first monitoring appointment so that you understand as I was confused my first appointment. The nurses for my ultrasounds were very nice but I had to tell Dr. Copperman that nurses should always introduce themselves prior to an ultrasound taking place. After I provided that feedback, all the nurses introduced themselves by name prior to my ultrasounds. I wish the waiting room had a better, brighter, more welcoming atmosphere. The doctors I saw on rotation for my monitoring appointments were very nice. Monitoring hours are from 7 - 8:30 am, but they definitely saw people after the end time (I'd always see women running in super late). The good thing about RMA is they have locations all over the city, so it's pretty convenient (ie, I had a meeting one morning on the east side. RMA UES is not my primary location, but I could be monitored there and then went right to my work meeting after). Sometimes the waiting room was crowded (usually on weekends, when only one location is open), but honestly there were always chairs and you always got in and out very quickly. I still felt like I had time to talk to the doctors and nurses on busy days, too. Overall a pretty easy experience. Monitoring varied a great deal. Sometimes it was empty sometimes it was literally standing room only. For the amount of women that had to show up for monitoring hours that clinic worked really fast and efficiently to see everyone.  They did a great job. There are quite a few people in the waiting room on some day, but then no one other than my self others.  I typically go first thing when the doors open and have found it to be very easy and smooth.  The women who draw your blood are amazing.  They never hurt me, always remember me and ask questions that make me feel at ease in the experience.The office was rarely busy for morning monitoring, and my wait was typically shorter than 15 minutes.  Typically, once I got called in for blood draw, the ultrasound nurse was waiting for me.  Monitoring hours was a breeze. Sometimes the office would be very busy, but it was most efficient and worked well with my work schedule. I know many people say that it's a cattle call, but I never felt that way. It is certainly a busy clinic, but I think that's attributed to their success and how many people want to be under RMA's care. It can be a bit of a wait for monitoring depending on what time you arrive, but once you are seen, it's very quick. Monitoring was from 7-8:30 AM and was easy for me since I worked 9-5 and worked half an hour away by train. Me and my wife go the there before 7 and usually on the first there to be seen. At 7 bloodwork was taken then went in for ultrasound right away. We usually left between 7:15- 7:30 AM. Monitoring is from 7am-8:30am everyday. If in a rush, get there by 6:50, but they always have two doctors there, so you are usually in and out within 30 minutes if you show up later. There are always nurses there also if you need to meet with them. I live on Long Island so did majority of monitoring appointments at Long Island office (Garden City) which is brand new and very pleasant!! My one complaint was that I was not informed by RMA that I could go to the Merrick office during weekend monitoring, so instead I commuted into Manhatthan a few times when it was not necessary. The East side location's waiting room is very crowded and there is sometimes a long wait time, however, it didn't take away from the level of care and attention.As previously mentioned it was an extensive cattle-call. Medical Assistants were also not very adept at venipuncture nor did they listen to my specific requirements which resulted in multiple punctures (more than 5 on one occasion)Madison office is a nightmare.  They often opened late at the Downtown facility, but the staff there is great. Great! Easy location-and they are quick, in and out within 15 minutes.Can be a long wait but it's pretty expected so not a huge issueEfficient, well-oiled machine. Each monitoring visit lasted between 20-60 minutes, depending on when I showed up and how busy it was.  60 minutes was extreme, and only happened maybe once or twice out of dozens of visits.If you got there by 8, it was easy. If you came at 8:30, there was a backup. The monitoring and blood draw was quick. Seeing a nurse could take time. It was a cattle call and often created conflicts with work because they were completely inflexible. The front desk admin sent out bloodwork for the day multiple times before monitoring hours were over, leading to issues with same day results. efficient, busy, could be really bad on the weekends- they are open almost 360 days out of 365 so thats a plus, but they are busy.  location super convenient for me, and staff is helpful but busyFirst come, first serve. The LI office was usually quiet. There was a wait only a couple of times.It was efficient, at times felt crowded but was manageable. The staff were always helpful and one could see everyone was trying their best and communicating really with each other, which can give a lot of confidence to patients.It was efficient. No waiting, no stress, bloodwork, then ultrasound and then you are out the door and on to the rest of your day.It was pretty well oiled of a machine, but it did impact my day - I had to be there 7 - 8:30 am every day, which was challenging with daycare drop off and work, but i made it work. it was easier to just have a window that I could communicate to others than have to make individual appts for me.They are a well-oiled machine. Monitoring hours can get quite busy, but they are organized and it goes pretty quickly. They also have several other locations throughout NYC and you can go to any of those locations for monitoring during the week, which is nice.Monitoring hours were quick and efficient, even when there were 30 people in the waiting room. Efficient but it is a cattle call and horrible on the weekend when everyone decends on this clinic. I hated thatMonitoring was from 7am-9:30am. I was able to go in before work and complete monitoring before my work day started.It could get busy during monitoring hours. They key is to come in early and be one of the first patients to be seen especially if an ultrasound is needed. The phlebotomist are nice and the staff that help during the ultrasound are also very nice. Be prepared also to be seen by different doctors for the ultrasound as they rotate their days in coming in early during monitoring hours. Cattle call for sure but in and out pretty quickMost of my monitoring is done remotely, but when I have gone to monitoring hours it's been at the Manhattan – Eastside office which is quite busy. That being said they are very efficient and if you get there early you can get in and out rather quickly.It was morningtime before work. I was lucky enough to live walkable to the location. The phlebotomist at this location was the BEST - pain free, didn't leave marks, always quick. It took longer for the ultrasounds depending on what time you arrived, but never TOO long. 

The weekend hours were at the Madision Avenue location were a cluster and cattle call. Jam packed, call out your name large system. It was disappointing there were no hours at the BK location. It was a cattle call line, but I rarely waited more than 15 minutes. I was one of the first to enter, though.The system worked and it was pretty quick. Only on weekends when everyone needs to go to one clinic located on the East side the wait would be a little longer but never more than 20-30 minutes.Monitoring hours are in the morning. However, it runs very smoothly and I was never sitting around waiting for more than 20 to 30 minutes...and those waits were usually on the weekend. On weekdays, I hardly waited at all and could go to monitoring and still be on time for work.Monitoring hours were typically smoothly run. They could get be crowded depending on the day, but most of all it was as positive an experience as possible.The monitoring hours are every day from 7am until 8:30am (plus minus 30 minutes as I do not remember exactly). The later you come the more people are waiting. For the most part, the wait was not long. If you arrive early then there might not even be a wait.This is a large practice and it has a first come, first served policy. Once you get a handle on when things are busy and how long they last, it is very easy to work around the monitoring hours. However, my wife and I had a great deal of flexibility in our morning schedules, which allowed us to handle the monitoring quite easily, your results may vary. Monitoring was a well oiled machine. If we got there early enough it didn't ruin our day. And since there are locations all over the city it felt quite easy. And then we would treat ourselves for a nice breakfast before work. Monitoring hours were a pain because of my work schedule . I wished that the monitoring hours were more flexible .Monitoring occurred very early in the morning . There was no flexibility which made it stressful and difficult to arrange times with work and getting to the appointment on time . I would prefer if they had afternoon hours to accommodate people with a different time schedule . Some days it was packed but they always moved through it as quickly and efficiently as they could. Most of all I appreciated the professionalism of the staff, including receptionists - they would take the brunt of it when it was packed with grace. Monitoring appointments at RMA of New York are well organized. I typically never waited longer than 15 minutes to be called and was typically always in and out within 45 minutes. It was convenient to have this monitoring hours range, but I found that the earlier I went, the faster I was seen. If I came in closer to the end of the period, I had to wait much longer.IT was well oiled machine. 
Never a line. ALways took them on a first come first serve basis. the overall experience is good. 95% of time are pretty quick and standard. wish I get less bruise from the blood drawing. There are 2 nurses's technique are bite harsh.I liked that the hours were early and I could go before work, and the window of time was substantial. However, it is such a huge place that sometimes I would wait an entire hour. And there was no way to predict it! So I'd have to go much earlier than I wanted just in case. It did feel a bit like cattle call. Monitoring was fine in the morning.  I got there when it opened and there was often a couple people in front of me waiting to go in.  Monitoring hours were 7-8:30am, I believe. They were first-come, first-served. During the week I would arrive at 6:45 and never waited longer than 45 min. Weekends would be a longer wait because I would get there between 7:30-8. I was usually out by 9 or 9:30, though. Super busy at all times. Always a wait. I found the monitoring appointments to go fine.  It was on a first come, first serve basis.  I tried to get there early and was always seen in a timely manner.  I liked how they did their monitoring hours.Monitoring hours were well run, everyday morning 6-8:30. Perfect for working women like me. There was hardly much wait time, was in and out within half hour most days. Weekend and holiday monitoring is usually at the mid-town clinic.  Monitoring was during convenient times  (early morning) before I had to go to work. I never had to wait very long. It was an efficient process. I have heard horror stories about wait times at other clinics and I didn't experience more than a 20 min wait here. One large plus to RMA was their early monitoring hours, so it would not interfere with my work schedule. We found if we got there early it would go rather quickly. The nursing staff always had a smile and were very gentle. Dr. Stein was usually the one there, and if not, the other doctors were very kind. 
Weekdays was easier and quicker. Weekends we all have to go to east side - so more jammed and longer wait. But it didn't bother me.  Staff was nice and efficient. Morning monitoring hours are from 7 to 8:30am, so it allowed me to go there and then head to work, which I thought was very convenient. 

On average I waited 20-25 minutes to get called, and was done in an average of 15-20 minutes for both ultrasound and blood work.   I usually did monitoring in Brooklyn and it was reasonable.  The Madison Ave office could be a ""cattle call"" and on a couple of occasions when I didn't come at the very beginning (i.e., 7am), I had to endure very long waits.  Always busy but if you get there for the start of monitoring hours, I was out within 30minutes. East was quicker than west side clinic. If you want to see a nurse, that can take a while to wait. Otherwise, bloods and US were quick.It was first come, first serve. Hours vary by office. Wait was typically 30 mins to an hour for the entire process (bloodwork and ultrasound) but it went fast with the amount of people they see.It was efficient, but busy and wait times were never more than 20 minutes. It is first come first serve but they move very quickly. Monitoring hours are from 7:30-9:30 and between 8:30-9:30 it is slow and you walk in and out. The monitoring appointments were very smooth and quick.  They have monitoring hours but its w ell oiled machine and the wait wasn't very long.  Much better than other places in the city.First come first serve and because I had to be at work early I would arrive 45 minutes early to secure my #1 spot on line. RMA had a few locations throughout Brooklyn and Manhattan where you can do monitoring. The Manhattan offices were like a cattle call. I once was in the waiting room for almost 2 hours! the Brooklyn office is a little less of a wait because its a smaller office. There were on occasion very long waits but I don't blame the clinic for that. I think they moved people in and out as efficiently as possible. First come, first served, from 7--830.  There were always tons of women there, but only a couple instances where it wasn't moving efficiently enough.The monitoring hours are from 7am-9am, but the waiting room gets very full and the wait times can be very long.  The best time to go is first thing in the morning and be there when they open at 7am.  Each time I did this, I never waited more than 10 minutes.  
However, the waiting does have WiFi, which is nice.- Morning monitoring at RMA is a smooth affair. Can sometimes take about an hour, but time it right (e.g. arrive early or late) and you can be in and out within 20 minutes. The folks doing the blood work are especially amazing. We have a thin vein problem and the lab folks were always smiling reassuring, patient
Weekdays 7-10am monitoring hours. I always arrived by 6:45, out by 7:30 at latest. Very efficient and well run. On weekends you have to go to the big main clinic. I had a longer wait there but it was quicker than I expected considering the number of patients waiting. There was a window of time in the morning which was nice in a way since I didn't have to miss work. They are very quick and on average would probably spend 15 min waiting which wasn't terrible considering how many people were waiting. The weekend had one location open across the entire city and it was a cattle call.  It is a nightmare to go there with waits lasting over an hour, nowhere to sit, etc.I tried getting to the office before it technically opened since I have to be at work early in the morning (by 8am).  Usually there were about 5 people there with me.  They generally started seeing patients for monitoring on time.  The longest I waited was an hour, but that only happened once.Easy and pretty efficient...Cattle call.  Huge waiting room that took ages.I covered this earlier -- it is very busy during morning monitoring but they have so many phlebotomists that it takes no time to get blood draws done. Sometimes there is a minor wait to get twanded but I was never there more than an hour. Just don't expect to ask questions or get much information during the monitoring ultrasounds because they have to see a million patients in a row before and after you.  Ugh.  Different person every time.  Phlebotomists were truly awful.  The monitoring hours were first come first serve from 7-8:30am.  Depending on the day of the week and the time you arrived, it could be a quick wait or it could be a never ending line.  On average I would say wed be seen within 20min of arrival and check in.  

Although there were often people waiting, the clinic was efficient with their process of moving people through lab work and ultrasounds as quickly as possible.  Monitoring hours were 7:00 - 8:30. You could show up anytime during those hours. The earlier you got there, the shorter the wait. On occasion I went to the Long Island offices. There monitoring hours were 8 am - 10 am and there was rarely a wait. Dr. Lederman and his staff would open the office early to accommodate people's work schedules.  He would see me at 7 or 7:30am most days, so that I could get to work by 8am.  Well oiled machine. Super efficient.I disliked this, but I do understand how this can be more efficient for the clinic.  Sometimes I would wait 60-90minutes and a few times more.  It added to the feeling of a cattle call and seeing different people each time.  I felt like a cog in the wheel than a woman who was trying to have a baby.ugh.  you had to wait. you didnt know if it would be 10 minutes or 40 minutes.  during a 10 day cycle its awful when you are racing to get to work.  The waiting room is absolutely packed.  And they make you go back into the waiting room between blood and doctor sonogram (in 2010/2011 you went right in).  general impression of the difference between 2010/2011 and 2013/2014 was that they got too big too fastMonitoring hours are easy and efficient. Like could get very long on the weekends but felt it was as efficient as possible. Sometimes I can’t a little after monitoring hours and was never an issuePretty efficient. It is from 7 - 8:30 in the morning, which has been difficult as I live in queens.Monitoring appointments were pretty easy. Some days were busier than others but I usually didn’t find that I had to wait long. Monitoring appointments are only from 7 AM - 9 AM on weekdays. If your monitoring appointment falls on a weekend, you have to go the Eastside office with similar hours.When i would go to the monitoring in Garden City there was not a lot of wait but in the weekend that office is closed so i had to go to NYC. The wait could be anywhere from 1 to 1.5 hours.Get there first thing in the morning and you are in and out within 15 minutes.  Otherwise be prepared to wait approximately 45 min.The window was convenient but it was terribly busy. Often times I waited an hour or more.some days it was terrible other days it was nice and quick. if you get there early around 7, it is always quick--under 30 minutesWell oiled machine in the downtown office. I was usually in and out within 20-30 minutes. But Midtown is another story. Much longer wait times.It was fineThe Long Island office was small - I rarely had to wait more than 5 minutes. When I had to go to NYC the wait was much longer.Easy and well run.it was very efficient.Well run, at an inconvenient time, I live in queens and it is from 7-8:30 am.Blood lab staff were awesome. Lines could be long but he clinic was efficient with getting patients in and out.Monitoring hours were a zooCattle call but in and out which was fine with me. It was fast your get in btwn 7 and 8 am and would do bloods then get placed in a room for ultrasoundCattle call -- wait wasn't too bad at Brooklyn.
The morning monitoring hours were actually not super convenient for me because I work a later shift, but I understand they work for people who do a 9 to 5 so I have no real complaints there. you had to arrive before 9 am or they literally would make you leave and return the next day. sometimes you need to know what your blood levels are that day and you cannot wait one more day to do so - that was really annoying. sometimes I had to run there to make it to the 9 am cutoff. Also, it was about an hour wait every time.Weekend mornings, all monitoring is funneled to a single clinic location, so there would be a HUGE crowd and a long wait. Otherwise, monitoring was efficient.Monitoring hours went pretty smoothly. My only complaint was the shortness of the time window for monitoring. With NYC public transportation unpredictable service, I did feel like I was rushing to make the window.it was  well oiled machine.  The operation was very efficient.Once I got used to it, it was easy. I knew the latest I could show up in the morning (I'm not a morning person), and when I would usually be done by. The staff who drew my blood were almost all warm and skilled. Doctors who did ultrasounds were friendly and patient and would stop to answer any questions I had as needed.The structure at RMA is very efficient and effective, which works great for my busy schedule. They are a well oiled machine.1/2 hour wait at mostOn time which is appreciated!",7.799999999999984,7.899999999999985,"The downtown office is small and very efficiently run. I didn't enjoy calling the main number bc I would often wait on hold Or not get the result I wanted in an efficient wayIn the middle of a cycle, when stress is at the highest, they will go out of their way to be calm, kind and clear. The practice is a well-oiled machine and you never feel neglected or forgotten. I appreciated that flexibility, when necessary and I always found everyone friendly and helpful. Hard to contact nurses and doctors directly. Mistakes are made and they aren't proactive enough in planning. I appreciated that they did not feel
disruptive to the work day, but it also meant luck of the draw (ha ha) for phlebotomists and doctors. Liza and Sima were the only ones who could get my blood painlessly every time. RMA has a lot of patients overall but I found the third party experience to be very personalized, which it should be, given the financial investment. Very pleased with the outcome of the cycle, and I'm sure I have to credit the clinic and the doctors/embryologists for their great work. For any new patient i recommend first asking questions before the initial consultation to see which doctor are at the office during a day of the week you can work around if you have a job. The doctors are great clinicians and very responsive. The clinic is also very challenging to work with concerning billing. The clinic where you have the procedures it's ok, not impressive but has everything that they need to perform the job. Strengths - thorough, efficient, multiple locations, everyone works together, very clear financial information
Weaknesses - everything is done at the Madison Avenue location on weekends and it can be very busy with a bit of a waitRMA is a factory - again, this isn’t necessarily a bad thing but it does mean you won’t get personalized care and you MUST stay on top of your own treatment and be your own advocate. And I have found the other doctors at RMA that I have seen during monitoring, egg retrieval, and FET transfer to be overwhelming competent and warm which is nice because you don't always get to do procedures with your doctor. They do not believe in immunology issues and are not particularly open/imaginative about understanding RPL. I asked to be emailed and that made things much easier. The nursing staff always had a smile and were very gentle. I personally don't mind that it's like a factory because Dr. Flisser always makes an effort to see and treat his patients. I will mention that any time I was seen by another doctor, mine always followed up almost immediately with a personal phone call. There are monitoring hours Monday-Sunday. Generally quick turnaround for monitoring, though I've waited there once up to an hour. Other than that I was happy with RMA..Very organized and almost always available - they run like a machine. Also when you call, if is quite difficult to speak to the doctor. They are organized, friendly, clean and reliable. Allowed children to go to appointments (except IVF) which is helpful when dealing with secondary infertility.very efficient with getting me in and out for all the lab draws and u/s
very good place for a working womanI love my clinicIt was a factory; get there as early as possible or you could be there for a long timeThe entire staff were extremely detailed oriented - from the front desk, to the nurses, to the financial consultants. The practice is  trusted by many patients. The best time to go is first thing in the morning and be there when they open at 7am."
25,RMA of New York,protocol,"After our 4th failed IUI, he encouraged us to move onto IVF bc we were approaching later 30s. Based on my response to Clomid, he predicted I would be a low responder and put me on an antagonist protocol (no estrogen priming, no Lupron suppression). He was pretty spot on in his predictions of how the cycle would go--and I ended our first fresh IVF cycle with a positive beta and a healthy, full term singleton.he was going to do a long antagonist protocol. i didnt move forward with him.Letrazol with timed intercourse and IUII used the antagonist protocol for IVF. The injections were adjusted based on how I responded to the medication.  I had 18 retrieved and ended up with 3 embryos.  For the transfer, I was able to take the pills which were much easier.  It was a little stressful during the injections as they are timed but we were able to make the times work around my schedule.  I always brought them with me incase I got delayed.  It’s a little easier preparing for the transfer.  I was able to use the pill form and you just have to follow the amount around the same time each day you need to take them. Going thru IVF gave me my 2 boys (2 year old and 3 month old). I was on Gonal and Menopur for stimulation and lupron and pregnyl for trigger before retrieval. They retrieved 8 eggs, 2 of which produced embryos. After pgs neither embryo was determined viable for transfer. Dr Lederman has said he would increase medications on the next retrieval in the aim to get more mature eggs.Retrieval #1: Gonal-F in the morning, Menopur in evening.  Cetrotide added 5 days before trigger.  Dual trigger shot (HCG and lupron).  14 days of stims.  Resulted in 20 eggs, 5 mature, 5 fertilized, 4 made it to day 5, 4 PGS normal.

Before first transfer: hysteroscopy - 2 small polyps and small adhesion removed.

Transfer #1: BCP, estrodiol 2x day at day 3, increased to 3x a few days later.  Progesterone (1mL) 5.5 days before transfer, medrol for 7 days starting 5 days before transfer, baby aspirin day of transfer.  Resulted in CP.
Transfer #2: Next cycle after.  Estrodiol 2x day at day 3, increased to 3x a few days later.  Progesterone (1mL) 5.5 days before transfer, medrol for 7 days starting 5 days before transfer, baby aspirin day of transfer.  Resulted in CP.
Transfer #3.  RPL panel (negative), karyotyping (negative), saline sonogram (negative) biopsy (positive for endometritis).  2 weeks of antibiotics.  Estrodiol 2x day at day 3 of following cycle, increased to 3x a few days later.  Baby aspirin on day 3.  Progesterone (1mL) 5.5 days before transfer, medrol for 7 days starting 5 days before transfer.  Resulted in negative.
Transfer #4: 3 weeks of antibiotics.  Estrodiol 2x day at day 3 of following cycle, increased to 3x a few days later. Baby aspirin on day 3.  Progesterone (1mL) 5.5 days before transfer, prometrin (2x day) and endometrin (2x day) starting day after transfer, medrol for 7 days starting 5 days before transfer.  Resulted in CP.

Retrieval #2: Gonal-F in the morning, higher dose (than last time) or Menopur in the evening.  Cetrotide added 6 days before trigger.  Lupron trigger only.  15 days of stims. 19 eggs, 18 mature, 16 fertilized, 9 made it to day 5/6/7, 5 PGS normal, 1 inconclusive.

Transfer #5: 12 days of birth control pills, 5 days overlapping with 10 units of lupron.  Continued 10 units of lupron until light period arrived, reduced to 5 units.  3.5 weeks of lupron total.  Estrodiol added 2x day, increased to 3x a few days later. Baby aspirin on day 3.  Progesterone (1mL) 5.5 days before transfer, prometrin (2x day) and endometrin (2x day) starting day after transfer, medrol for 7 days starting 5 days before transfer.  Resulted in pregnancy starting with very low beta (37 at 9dp5dt) - currently 9+2 weeks.We first began with ""timed intercourse"" which consisted of trigger shots and monitoring.  It was a little under a year of my husband and I TTC, which was still a little early, but he seemed understanding and very willing to assist us.  We did two of those, followed by a round with letrozole.  Followed by 3 rounds of ""timed intercourse"" we moved on to 4 IUI's with letrozole, trigger shots, and of course monitoring. Antagonist protocol - retrieval (Gonal F 150IU sub Q daily; Menopur 2 vials sub Q daily; Ganirelix 1 PFS sub Q daily; Trigger: leuprolide, 40IU Sub Q once when directed plus 1 x 1,000IU of Novarel  hCG; Azithromycin Two x 500mg for husband)

Transfer: Estrace 1 x  2mg tablets up to 3x daily at times, Progesterone in Oil up to 2 ccs injected intramuscularly at times, Medrol 1 tab PO QD x 7 days; Two x 500mg Azithromycin)

I can't say I remember what the rationale was for using this protocol, I assumed I just got 'the usual.'

Results: retrieved 11 eggs, nine survived overnight, eight embryos survived after five days and four were free of genetic defects after PGS. RMA has pretty much gotten IUI cycles down to a science: bloodwork, meds, ultrasounds, insemination, two-week call. Because I was at the beginning of my journey, this process was about making sure my uterus was in good shape (it was not so we had to work on that) and then getting me in and out for IUI cycles with the appropriate drugs. Pretty basic.I did an unmedicated IUI with an ovulation trigger shot. My tests were all good and the shot helped produce a longer leuteal phase (I was ovulating late in the cycle naturally), so there was no reason to do medicated cycles. I had no indications of fertility issues, but was 40, so he supported my desire to strike a balance between minimal intervention and not waiting too long. I got pregnant on my second IUI (2nd at RMA, I also had 1 at Columbia). My son was born healthy and beautiful. Letrozole with HCG trigger shot for all six IUIs, transfer at 24 hours with frozen sperm samples. No pregnancies or positive pregnancy tests resulted. During IVF cycle, used a standard cocktail with a high dose of Menopur, Gonal-F, Pregnyl trigger, and Progesterone shots following the egg retrieval. Retrieved 5 eggs, 4 became 5-day blastocysts. We transferred one, it did not work. Froze the remaining three and have not yet done a frozen cycle.Don't recallAntagonist protocol freeze all cycle with genetic screeningHer first suggestion was using donor eggs due to my low ovarian reserve/high FSH. While I understood that donor eggs would give us much higher potential for success, we were disappointed by the lack of real treatment strategies for using my own eggs first.Took medication days 5-9 and came in for ultrasound day 12. Came back one time after that to make sure I was ready for ovidrel injection which they administered in the office He wanted us to do IVF right away.  He did not believe in immune treatment.  We did a couple medicated IUIs with him.My protocols changed and adapted based on how I did last time. I cant say yet as I havent moved forward with treatment.He suggested natural cycle with trigger shot for 3 cycles then clomid for 3 cycles before trying iui and then ivf. Estrogen priming - started with this one because of my low AMH, high FSH. Didn't work. Only had one follicle so converted to IUI.
Lupron microflare - about to start now. Estrogen priming - started with this one because of my low AMH, high FSH. Didn't work. Only had one follicle so converted to IUI.
Lupron microflare - about to start now. Since I have PCOS and ovulate late (my cycles around about 3 months long), we started on Clomid and a trigger shot and tried that for a number of cycles.  When it didn't work he met with me and we talked about other options, and decided that before anything more invasive we should try another medication - i went on Letrazole and after 2 cycles got a positive pregnancy test.3 x no medication IUIs - unsuccessful
3x medicated back to back IUIs 
1x IVF eset- resulted in 6 x 5 day embryos. Transferred 1 for fresh cycle. Reaulted in chemical pregnancy
Frozen transfer resulted in twin pregnancy (carried out by different doctor because Joshua Klein left the practice)Dr. Mukherjee is reasonable yet aggressive.  He did not want me to waste time with too many IUIs, which many people end up doing.  We proceeded to IVF and ended up pregnant after 3 transfers. At first, our problems seemed to originate in PCOS and poor egg quality. Based on this initial assessment, we proceeded with an antagonist protocol. During the first retrieval, we successfully retrieved 17 eggs and created four embryos. Of those four, only one came back with a normal assessment form the PGS testing.

The second retrieval was a failure because the dosage of the trigger shot was too low (instructed by the doctor on call, not Dr. Stein).

The third retrieval yielded 21 eggs and 6 embryos. Based on the PGS assessment then, the doctor discovered we had a potential translocation issue. The doctor spoke with the lab to double-check his hypothesis that we had an instance of balanced translocation - and therefore could proceed to embryo transfer - and was very careful. This time we used OPC/LUPTON OVERLAP protocol and it seemed worked for our case as well.We moved forward with IUI for both of my pregnancies as my diagnoses was unexplained infertility and there were no obvious issues with my husband's sperm, etc. We were successful for the first time on round 3 with my first child, and the 2nd round with my 2nd pregnancy. I trusted Dr. Flisser and his suggestions for treatment wholeheartedly.I was on 2 vials of Menopur every night with the exception of one night when they dropped it down to 1 vial. I was on 150 IU of Gonal-F that I injected every morning. Towards the end of my cycle, they dropped the Gonal-F to 112.5 IU. The last few days of my cycle I did Gonal-F in the morning and Menopur and Cetrotide at night until my trigger shot. We used an antagonist protocol. Because we'll be using a GC, I was basically treated like an egg donor. Had to undergo FDA testing, genetic testing, etc before starting. I'm only 30, but egg quality/quantity was seemingly not an issue to begin with - we just wanted to retrieve eggs, make embryos, and freeze them for future use. It turned out my reserve is more diminished than AMH originally indicated, so I was put on doses more commonly used with 40 year olds. Can't remember specific doses, but all were quite high - 225 Gonal H, 3 or 4 menopurs a day in the beginning. Given that 5/12 eggs were immature, we're changing it a little this time to try and get more mature eggs. I was not put on birth control the first cycle, which apparently can promote consistency in follicular growth, so less of a chance of some follicles beating others. I don’t remember dosages. I had a pretty high AMH for my age (2.56 at 41) but he still used pretty high doses of meds I think. I stimmed for 11 days and got 46 eggs which shocked me. 35 fertilized and 31 made it to day one; 10 embryos made it to day 5 and of those half tested PGS normal. I did 2 medicated timed intercourse cycles and 2 medicated IUI’s mainly for insurance purposes. These cycles resulted in negative pregnancy tests. I had two ICSI, PGT, freeze-all cycles. The first one only yielded 1 day-5 PGT normal embryo. She adjusted the medication for next Egg Retrieval and I ended up with 4 day-5 PGT normal embryos. I was happy to have an adjustment and better results. My first embryo transfer ended in chemical pregnancy. The second one she added Lupron and I have an ongoing pregnancy from that cycle. I did 3 IUIs using only Ovidrel because I have no ovulation issues.  They all resulted in negatives, but I am 40 so that doesn't really surprise me too much.  We are now moving on to IVF.We did the microflare lupron protocol. Accdg to the nurse, it was because I have DOR and it would be a good protocol for me. However, i did not have enough matured follicles for the egg retrieval to happy. It only resulted to 2 mature one size 18, 16 and 2 small ones size 13-14. So we had to cancel the ER and did an IUI instead. It was not successful. One of the first things we did after the initial consultation and tests was agree to a genetic test. Doing that test we found out that we are both carriers for hearing loss and that set our treatment off.  We wanted to start slow, medications first and then IUI treatment, but because our kids have a 1 in 4 chance of having hearing loss Dr. Stein recommended starting right off with IVF, and we agreed.  For the first part of the IVF treatment, I did two weeks of injections, going to my doctors office 10 times in those 14 days for blood work and ultrasounds.  Once my hormone levels were up and my follicles were large enough I was scheduled for the egg retrieval. The results of the egg retrieval were 7 eggs, 6 were fertilized, 4 matured to the point that they could be biopsied. Of the 4 biopsied and tested 2 eggs are ""perfect"" and can go on to be implanted.  I am now waiting to start the next phase for the egg transfer next.My first cycle began with birth-control, then Gonal-F and Cetritide and Menopur.  My second round involved E2 patches, Clomid, Gonal-F, and Menopur, the most successful and resulting in 12 retrieved, 3 tested, 3 frozen embryos.2 IVF cycles - both antagonist - first without birth control and the second with.  We needed a second cycle after all our embryos arrested on day 3 in the first cycle.  The second cycle was different to help the eggs mature at the same rate to retrieve more mature eggs.  Both cycles produces 18 eggs each.  I remember him starting me low on clomid then slowly increasing the dosage. Same goes for all other medications as he was proceeding carefully.For both of the IUIs, I was on Letrozole and then Ovidrel as the trigger shot. 
For IVF, I was on a combination of Gonal, Menopur, and Cetrotide and then the Lupron Trigger Shot. The dosages of the medications differed between the two IVF protocols. After the initial consultation in February the Dr prescribed birth control pills for 3 months for my wife. I had to take Clomid for 3+ months to raise my testosterone (Prescribed by another doctor at RMA) After 3 months my wife started the injections for about 2 weeks and used 2-3 different types a day. The injections were usually 1 in the morning and 2 or 3 at night (depending how she responded through bloodwork and ultrasound).  At the 2 egg retrievals we did my wife produced upwards of 20 eggs for each one but my low quality sperm (through a genetic condition) was used and ICSI and PGS was needed. 

1st Egg retrieval: 22 Eggs retrieved, 16 were matured, 14 fertilized, 7 blasts but only 2 were normal.

2nd retrieval: 26 Eggs retrieved, 20 were mature, only 4 fertilized (used my frozen sperm) but all made it to blast. Only one was genetically normal.

The first egg retrieval ended up with 2 genetically normal 6AA blastocysts and the second ended with 1 genetically normal AC blast. We did a FET with one of the 6AA in August and my wife is currently 5 months pregnant. 3 IUI’s—Clomid then IUI’s which did not work (he has said they have a very low percent chance of working for me but I did them by choice.)

1st retrieval—GonalF and Menopur 

2nd retrieval—estrogen patch priming, gonal F, menopur. The estrogen priming seemed to make a big difference for me. 

Implant: estrogen and progesterone For both cycles, I was given the same protocol. : Follistim, Ganirelex, and Menopur were the main stimulation medications. Lupron and Pregnyl were the trigger shots.She kept my doses very high of Follistim (from prior two cycles) despite my asking for an adjustment. She also added additional Menopur and LEtrozole over the amounts used in my prior cycles. I suggested that she was over-medicating me she did not heed my concerns. I ended up developing very three large follicular cysts which were atretic (like my prior two cycles) and her other follicles failed to grow after a certain point.We were diagnosed with unexplained infertility. We tried clomid with IUI for 3 cycles and then moved on to IVF which worked on the first cycle for us. Never did he push us to go one way or the other but rather always gave us our options and allowed us to chose Diagnosed with hypothalamic amenorrhea so directed to go straight to IVF given my desire to get pregnant.

Given only Menopur on my retrieval cycle, which I've heard is normal with HA.  

Transfer medication included oral estrace, estrace patch and progesterone shots.  After first pregnancy resulted in ectopic they added a baby aspirin.  Only other change was in my fourth transfer, taking 1 dose of estrace vaginally to increase the thickness of my lining. Because of my family history with cancer, Dr. McAvey insisted that I get my yearly mammogram (which I hadn't done in a couple of years) before starting me on any stimulating meds. We started the IUI with Letrozole. I had 3 consecutive appointments where no growth was occurring, so she switched me to Clomid in hopes to get the growth we needed to proceed with the insemination. The second check-up after the Clomid showed a handful of matured eggs. She said I was ready, so we then administered my trigger shot which was Ovudrel. Only 2 bloodwork needed the whole treatment. Still awaiting the insemination.1. Antagonist protocol, with menopur, gonal and cetrotide for my first IVF cycle
2. Flare protocol with lupron, gonal, menopur for my second, as I only produced 8 follicles for my 1st try, resulting in 0 healthy embryos, it as decided that this protocol should produce more follicles. This only produced 7 follicles, however, resulted in 0 healthy embryos.First protocol was Gonal F + Menopur + Microdose Lupron which resulted in 4 retrieved, 2 fertilized with ICSI and 1 sent for PGS. Second protocol included estrogen patch + Gonal F + Menopur which resulted in 2 retrieved, 2 fertilized with ICSI and 1 fresh transfer.Levothyroxine for hypothyroidism.

Menopur, cetrotide, and follistim during egg retrieval.  Lupron trigger.

Progesterone (once daily) and estradiol (3 times daily) prior to, during, and after transfer.

Results: 13 eggs harvested, 9 embryos created, 5 embryos available for transfer after genetic testing.

I never really felt any “different” on any of the medications.For IUI,  RMA took bloodwork on Day 3 and will send an email to let you know when to come in for ultrasound and trigger shot and the date for IUI. During the ultrasound, you have to ask for folical number and sizes. RMA does not share that information by default. We did three IUI cycles with Femera, which he said was better than Clomid for patients like me with PCOS. We were also briefly on an antagonist protocol for IVF before it was cancelled due to a lead follicle. During that IVF treatment I was monitored every 2 days also because of my PCOS. We did three retrieval cycles, each with a different third drug. The third cycle worked significantly better than the previous two. I believe I did the antagonist protocol and had to do 13 days of shoes because my follicles took awhile to develop. I've done the standard DOR antagonist protocol, gonal f 300, menopur 2 vials for 4 days than increased to 3, with ganirelix once the leading follicle reached 16 mm, and ovidrel shot- Once we tried luptondown regulator that suppressed me too much so went back to antagonist with no birth control. out of 4 cycles, we are left with 2 pgs normal out of a total 12 embroys in 4 cycles. no changes to regimen was based on the fact that antagonist works best for DOR, estrogen has risen, and follicles were produced, yet the low results are to be expected due to aging  We did six IUI cycles over all. The first one was unmedicated and failed. The second one was unmedicated with the ovidrel trigger shot and failed. The third through sixth attempts were medicated with letrozole and ovidrel trigger shot, all of which failed as well. We are now in conversation about moving to IVF.  Dr Sandler has suggested not doing PGT testing since he doesn’t think I’ll have enough embryos given my low AMH level.We did 4 cycles with Clomid (some where cancelled due to cysts). Due to my response to Clomid (and my concerns about elevated risks for breast/ovarian cancers), we changed to Letrozole for IUI. We did 3 cycles of IUI. Since research does not show additional benefit after 3 cycles of IUI, we discussed moving on to IVF. We did 2 cycles, first using an antagonist-protocol, the second using an estrogen-priming antagonist protocol (which adjusts for my high estrogen levels early in the cycle). Both had a high number of oocytes retrieved, but poor egg maturation/embryo blastulation rates. After 2 retrievals, we did 2 transfers. Neither resulted in a pregnancy, so we did additional testing and I sought additional opinions to make sure we were not overlooking anything. The testing revealed my husband had a balanced translocation. To potentially improve my embryo quality for the 3rd retrieval we changed to back to an antagonist protocol using an additional Letrozole flair during treatment. However, that cycle was the least successful - 2 embryos after 1 week but PGS testing showed they were both abnormal. Dr. McAvey then had a frank conversation about what to consider going forward and encouraged me to seek other opinions.I think they were the antagonist protocol.  1st retrieval was priming with birth control, and then 300iu Gonal F in the AM and 2 vials of menopur at night with a dose of micro dose lupron in the AM and PM.  Menopur was adjusted during the cycle. Plus a trigger shot.  2nd retrieval was priming with estrogen patch and cetrotide, then was 200iu Gonal F in the AM and 2 vials of Menopur in the PM with cetrotide and two different trigger shots.  2nd retrieval was better, but embryo tested abnormal.Dr. Mukherjee tried different protocols in my case (very light/mini, conventional, agonist and antagonist) and adjusted as we went along. Every change made sense, and I felt I was with a doctor who sincerely only had my best interest at heart. It was with his help and open, innovative approach, that I actually had a pregnancy for the first time in 3 years of trying (it was unfortunately lost to a miscarriage, but there was a pregnancy with my own eggs).We have only done one clomid iui cycle with her that was unsuccessful. We are currently on our second cycle of clomid and waiting for the iui. The first cycle Dr Sekhon prescribed clomid to us after blood work on CD3 then had me come back on cycle day 10 for a scan trigger shot and iui the next day. I did feel it was a little early, but I was seeing another dr in her practice that morning so didn't have a chance to discuss. I voiced my concerns and this round we are doing scans and blood work to make absolutely sure its the the right time to trigger. Dr Sekhon had absolutely no problem at all with tailoring the treatment. I was informed that my BMI was too high so I met with the nutritionist, who helped bring that down so I could take Clomid and have less of a risk of a heart attack with the lower BMI. That's about all that I could remember.Day 2 I began 5ml Lupron and 300 Follistim in the AM and 5ml Lupron and 150mg Menopur in the PM . I did that for 10 days until my trigger shot. My trigger was Ovidrel.My first cycle was antagonist protocol, where I was on gonal f, menopur, and cetrotide.  I was a slow responder to the medications, so was on stims for a full 14 days.  the retrieval yielded 12 eggs, 9 mature all of which fertilized.. but nothing made it to blastocyst and all remaining embryos arrested on day 6 before making it to blast (most had died off around day 3).  The second cycle i was shifted to microflare protocol, using lupron, follistim, menopur.  Again I was a slow responder, requiring 14 days of stims. Retrieval led to only 9 eggs, 7 mature, 5 fertilized, and zero making it to blatocyst. All arrested between days 3 and 5.  Heartbreak city.Dr. Grunfeld had me prime with estrogren patches and Ganirelix before my cycle began, then I did 14 days of 300 Gonal -F and Menopure once my cycle started. He started me out on 2 amps of Menopure but eventually upped my dose to 3 in hopes of getting a better response. I also took Ganirelix for 4 days toward the end. I triggered with lupron and novarell. I'm 41 and developed 9 follicles between my two ovaries. He was happy with this. Dr. Klein and his team are very concerned about success rates for people trying to conceive as well as doing it in the safest way possible. They follow the newest and best protocols from research (and some of the research they do themselves at RMA). He started us with IUI with Clomid and a trigger shot because my last fertility clinic only used OPK for IUI (obviously without success). After 2 of those, he was willing to do 1-2 more, but we were ready for IVF. He was supportive of this.Dr Stein always recommends a freeze all cycle with PGS testing and single embryo transfers.  As a low responder, I decided this is not the treatment plan I want to follow and have since switched doctors. My husband and I are currently waiting for my thyroid hormones to normalize before we begin our first cycle. I am unsure of what particular strategies and protocols are required, but I honestly trust his judgement while-heartedly. We will have to do the ICSI procedure due to medical necessity. Dr Klein’s people are in contact with our male fertility specialist, and this communication is so helpful so my husband and I don’t have to worry about being the messenger. Between our doctors, I know we’re in good hands. IVFWe did a normal range of tests and then tried 2 IUIs before I had to switch practices for insurance purposes.Antagonist for 2 cycles. I was slightly over suppressed on BCP for first cycle so we did less time on that for the second. Also I had less menopur and more follistim on the second. For the first cycle I got 4 blastocysts but when PGS tested, none were normal. For the second cycle I got 5 and 1 normalAs a Breast cancer survivor and a patient diagnosed with Diminsihed Ovarian Reserve, Dr. Lederman focused on quality not quantity. My treatment strategy focused on the use of Letrozole, Gonal F and Menopur. Letrozole was used to suppress estrogen due to my Breast Cancer History and the Gonal F and Menopur was used to help stimulate my follicles and eggs. Dr. Lederman increased the use of Menopur and Gonal F after the first round yielded only a few eggs. On my third round I produced 2x the amount of eggs from my first round and two of the embryo's made it to the blast/frozen stage and were sent for PGD/PGS testing.Dr Klein did my first two IUIs. He pretty much saw me as a professional favor to my OBGYN since I am a labor and delivery RN. He reviewed all my labs and diagnostics and did a phone consult. I took clomid 50mg, as I had been for the last two cycles, and I tracked my cycle with OPK and called him when I got a positive. We came in the next day for an IUI but after performing an ultrasound discovered that I had already ovulated. We did the IUI that day anyway but it was not successful. The next month he increased my clomid to 75mg and I was monitored by ultrasound until my follicles were the appropriate size. I received a trigger shot of ovidrel in his office and went to his office for an IUI the next morning. Unfortunately, this was also unsuccessful. He used the antagonist protocol, freeze all then frozen embryo transfer. I got follistim, menopur (forgot the dosages) then ganirelix then Lupron trigger. My husband took antibiotics prior to egg retrieval. After egg retrieval, I was given antibiotics. Then was started on estrace, Medrol. Then progesterone injections after transfer. I had 24 eggs retrieved; 4 PGS - 3 abnormal, 1 limited amplification but with repeat PGS that embryo was normal. 
They didn't really explain why they were doing what they were doing. I didn't know better and just went with the flow. Only until after I moved to a new doctor did I realize how left in the dark I was.Dr. Grunfeld gave me gonal F and Follistum for egg stimulation. He also added ganirelex later in the cycle and Ovidrel for trigger. IUI with Letrozole, Ovidrel.  Always same dosage, no success (3 tries).  Felt like we were just wasting time before IVF.We are doing our first IVF, due to male factor so I don't have any infertility diagnosis. I was put on birth control, then did menopur and gonal f for a bit more than 1 week, and then trigger shots for the retrieval. 
Since we did PGS testing, I was off meds for a bit more than 1 month and now just started the transfer meds including estrace and just started progesterone in oil shot. freeze all - antagonist protocol with birth control billsI used Gonal F, Menopure and Cetrocide towards the end of the retrieval. I was also on Lovonox 60mg to prevent blood clots due to Factor 5. I can try to look back and provide more information but it was approx 2 menopure vials at night, 300mg gonal f in the mornings and that increased towards the end. Before I could start IVF treatment I would need surgery to have my right Fallopian tube removed. Because it is filled with fluid there is a risk the the embryo can travel up in the tube. After this procedure I can start taking the meds which enables me to produce more eggs. During this time my husband and I were instructed to have blood work completed. I informed her that I would begin working for NYC DOE and she suggested that I should wait to being treatment because of the cost and my insurance as a NYC DOE teacher would cover IVF cost. This was heartbreaking to hear, however I have been trying to accept the reality that I will have to wait before I can begin this journey.It was very cookie cutter Gonal F and Menopur, with higher and higher doses as my body didn't react well. There was no preparation of my body for the IVF, no estrogen patch. In fact, my FSH was very high during the cycle. So high that I told the nurse this seems wrong, but they insisted everything was fine.  I came in after 2 chemical pregnancies in 10 months. He suggested ""time sex"" with the option for an IUI if my husband was out of town. He thought that based on my bloodwork, I might be ovulating at an unexpected time. They would monitor me till I was about to ovulate, then give me ovidrel, which would guarantee ovulation within 36 hours so that I would know when to ""try."" My husband ended up being out of town that week, so we did an IUI with frozen sperm, and I got pregnant on my first one.Based on my personal health and situation, it was decided to do IVF with freeze all cycle. I have some eggs frozen for future use and then added two cycles to fertilize the eggs and transfer embryos. I had two cycles and after having three healthy embryos (after performing PGS testing), I got pregnant after the first transfer. 1. He diagnosed me with PCOS (first time anyone said this to me fyi) and put me on metformin to improve my egg quality and my response to my drugs.
2. He said that my ovaries were very responsive and used lower doses of stimulation drugs for my IVF so I'd be more comfortable would have fewer side effects.
3. He set me up with a nutritionist so that I could lose weight and learn how to eat better for a person with PCOS (and I lost 60 pounds!).
4. He tested me for bacterial endometritis (which can happen in women that have had IVF and IUI and can prevent implantation during FET) and I definitely had it. We treated it for 2 weeks and then re-biopsied to confirm I was clear.Treatment protocols for egg retrievals were never changed or personalized, despite diminishing number of eggs retrieved each cycle as age increased. Dr. Copperman also would not consider natural cycle for FET.We started with IUI. I got pregnant on the second try but unfortunately miscarried at 7 weeks. We tried two more IUIs and then switched to IVF. The first egg retrieval was not successful as only 1 embryo survived and it did not pass the genetic testing. The second try was successful and we ended up with 3 healthy embryos. We did 3 transfers. 1 resulted in our beautiful son. The second resulted in a miscarriage. And the third one resulted in a healthy pregnancy. Due date is in September 2018.We completed seven IVF cycles with Dr Flisser. In broad strokes, the cycles were similar not not identical. The cycles all started with differing levels of Follistim and Menopur, followed by Ganirelix. We shifted from a Lupron trigger to a larger HCG trigger as our treatments progressed. 

We went in to the Garden City office for monitoring (blood and sono) during weekdays (we needed to run to the main Manhattan office on weekends). We would do a retrieval in Manhattan, followed by a fresh transfer on Day 5 (RMA only offers Day 5 transfers) and we always forewent PGS genetic testing. 

Our second cycle did produce a positive pregnancy result, but only lasted seven weeks until a miscarriage occurred. As we progressed in our cycles, we also decided to explore other, complimentary, options to our medical treatment. These ranged from added vitamins and antioxidants to thrice weekly acupuncture to more experimental methods involving immune-therapy. Dr Flisser was mostly receptive to our concerns, but did tell us when he thought these alternative methods would interfere with our regular regimen. Egg retrievals worked best for me when I took birth control pill for 1 month and then started menopur, follistum, and lupron. 

For FET I was on estradial pills, vaginal e-ring, and estrogen patch, and progesterone in oil via injection. I have done 2 IUIs with Dr. Davis, both with clomid and ovidrel. I did not have success with either cycle, but I was fully educated about my likelyhood of a pregnancy before proceeding. I intended on doing a third IUI, but the doctor saw a uterine polyp on my last ultrasound that needs to be removed. I am turning 37 and feel I don't want to delay any longer, so I will do an egg retrieval this month, remove the polyp the following month, and then do a frozen transfer after I recover from the polyp surgery.The antagonist protocal was used for my treatment .  I used Gonal F, Menopur , Cetrotide along with trigger shots Lupton and Oviidrel. The idea was to increase the amount of eggs for a successful cycle .  It worked ! Just hoping that a healthy embryo will be the result .I completed three rounds of IUI because my insurance didn’t allow for IVF until  I had three rounds of the IUI.  No pregnancy resulted from the IUI. Dr. Kudesia then started the IVF cycle but unfortunately had to move towards the end of my treatment. Due to my diagnosis of PCOS and hypothyroidism, I was prescribed Clomid, ovidrel, and endometrin for my IUis. Going forward, I will be doing IVF with ICSI. I’m unsure of the specific protocol being used at this time.Our tests were all “normal” so he explained that we fell into the “unexplained infertility” category. As a result, we were required to do a certain number of rounds of IUI before we were eligible for IVF (by our insurance, not clinic policy). 1st IUI was successful, but resulted in miscarriage at 9 weeks. He didn’t make us wait after that to try again. The next few cycles of IUI were not successful. Then we talked about IVF. We did one egg retrieval where they monitored me very closely to see how many eggs I was producing to determine when to retrieve. Only had to do one retrieval cycle - 23 eggs, resulting in 7 viable embryos. We were kept up to date every step of the way while the eggs were being fertilized, genetically tested and maturing. Round 1 embryo transfer - one embryo transferred. Unsuccessful. He told us outright he will not transfer multiple embryos because it was not worth the medical risk. Round 2 embryo transfer - one transferred. Successful. Monitored me weekly until after week 9 then released me into the care of my OBThe plan was pretty basic. Come
In for montioring and blood test after cycle day 1. Would go back a week or so later for an ultrasound. Then trigger, then back for IUI. She ordered to see and endocrinologist and my TSH level is normal now. Now we have done 4 IUIs , taking this month off to save money for IVF next month. 3 cycles of IUI: five days of Clomid, Ovidrel trigger shot, IUI

I cycle IVF (retrieval only, no normal embryos to transfer): Gonal F / Menopur / Cetrotide / Dual Trigger Lupron + hCG

I was not given a rationale for following this protocol. I have a good ovarian reserve for my age, so based on this IVF cycle my issue appears to be egg quality.I used clomid with a previous doctor -50 mg didn't work - 100 did work but didn't result in pregnancy. Under the care of dr lederman I have taken letrozol twice and done the ovidrel shot twice and an IUI twice I did an egg freezing cycle with him in July of 2019 (out of 4 follicles, only 1 egg was viable and was frozen). The protocol included Gonal-F and Menopur and the trigger shot. I actually started taking the injections fully on Day 4 because my Day 2 was a Sunday, and they told me to come in on Monday. After some confusion with Freedom Pharmacy and also the quite unclear videos from RMA on the injection methods (because I didn't have my medications or syringes with me to get a real life demo from the nurse), I ended up not injecting Gonal F or Menopur fully on Day 3. I'm not sure if my lateness in finally getting the injections correct meant that I had less stimulation, but anyway, I did manage to get 1 egg harvested and frozen. I was hoping for 2, but they said that one of the eggs was already degenerated when they harvested them.

I then tried an embryo freezing cycle in February 2020, and this time, he added Clomid and Ganirelix to my protocol. I took all the Clomid prescribed (5 days) and 1 day of Ganirelix, but the result of 1 egg harvested was the same. There were 5 follicles, and Dr. Mukherjee was hopefully that we could get 4 or 5 eggs harvested. But while the one egg that was harvested was successfully fertilized by my partner's sperm, it didn't make it to Day 5. It was heartbreaking to then end up with nothing after spending $17,000 or so when all was said and done. At that time, United Healthcare helped cover some medications, but I mainly used my 75% discount Compassionate Care card. My insurance did not cover the cycle. At our last consultation, Dr. Mukherjee said our best chance was to try naturally as I had a low ovarian reserve and rather than spend tens of thousands of dollars, that was our best bet, but my partner and I decided to change to a different doctor at Weill-Cornell who has been very kind and thorough and spent over an hour with us at our first consultation, patiently. He was recommended by a different friend who had a successful IVF cycle with him. After having failed 4 fresh cycles of IVF, i was familiar with protocol. He did his best to review my file from my other doctor and find out the best stim protocol to yield many babies. As it was a long time ago, I only remember being on Gonal F and Menopure. I can't tell you exactly how much But for Menopure I remember starting with 2 viles and then going up to 3. Their lab must have been great because I yielded 6 healthy embryos in 2 cycles which i never had before.
 Lupron protocol was used for me, don't know the rationale of why using Lupron.  That was exactly my previous comments that I wish Dr. McAvey explained to me more on the treatment strategies. I didn't know how many protocols are available and options before my treatment.  All the blood work seemed normal as progressed.  As a result of this Protocol, 2 matured size, 2 mid size and 1 small one. Dr. MaAvey did push 1 more day before the trigger shot to give more time for the small one to grow. Result: 5 retried and only 1 inseminated. And the only 1 inseminated one didn't grow after few days.First we tested my AMH and it was very good, and since I had been pregnant 3 times before we just did a non-medicated natural cycle that she monitored. I produced follicles on my own, ovulated according to the blood work, etc. Then when that didn't work she suggested we go right to IUI unmedicated and I did one unmedicated and it didn't work. Then we did one IUI cycle where I took 50mg of clomid, and then they gave me the trigger shot of ovidrel and that IUI also failed. Then I didn't have any more money for IUI's and my insurance covers NOTHING for fertility treatments. So then she decided to increase my dose of clomid to 100mg and then I gave myself the trigger at home, negative again. Then she increased me to 150mg clomid and I did the trigger shot again at home, negative. That following month she discovered a polyp on my uterus and I had read that was a side effect of clomid. On Feb, 14th 2017 I had the polyp surgically removed. Before we started trying again and while I was healing I had my husband go get his sperm analysis. Thats when we discovered his motility was 0%. I believe it was a standard protocol, with menapur, gonal F, and the trigger. for the transfer, we used PIO and estrace. 
When I wanted to add lovenox for low grade anticardiolipin levels, he was not supportive. Said it was risky (for bleeding) and wouldn't help. With our daughter who passed away, I got pregnant quickly so Dr. Kudesia expected that we would get pregnant again.  We started with medicated cycles and IUI given there were no other signals that we had any issues.  After that failed 6 times, we moved to IVF.  I went through 3 IVF cycles with Dr. Kudesia, all with different protocols. The first led to 0 day 5 embyros, the second had 1 (but it was abnormal following PGS testing) and the 3rd we did a day 5 fresh transfer as a last ditch effort to see if that would work.  I had good ovarian reserve and was 30, almost 31 years old, so we began with med to make me get a period, then letrozole with monitoeing, a trigger shot and timed intercourse. Because I had previously had a miscarriage at 10.5 weeks, he thought I could get pregnant again on my own. Letrozole was because it has less risk of multiples and less hormonal side effects. I got pregnant on our second round - a blighted ovum that we terminated with cytotec at 8 weeks. Because of this second loss, he suggested we do a immunology work up and we found that I  heterozygous for factor v lieden with positive antibodies. I wish he could have recommended a hematologist who took insurance but he couldn’t. I found one and she was fine though didn’t think I needed blood thinners. I appreciated that Dr. Sandler insisted. We did an egg harvest, genetic testing, and FET to control as many variables as possible. I loved that he insisted the progesterone suppositories were just as effective and less stressful, and so I used those and estrace of course. First fet was a chemical positive. Second resulted in our daughter! I used blood thinners the entire pregnancy and will again next time as well. Folgard too!I was not quite ready to do IVF and wanted to try other options, using letrizol, ovidrel, and progesterone with timed intercourse. I liked that Dr. Davis was open to this and never pushed me to move forward before I was ready. It was difficult that it never felt like we were trying to figure out what is wrong, but just trying solutions. None of these treatments ended in pregnancy. When IVF was a next step, I was moving out of state and did not continue at RMA for that reason.We did 3 IUI’s with trigger shot and clomid and then because of our age and history of infertility did IVF.  Egg retrieval brought 20 eggs.  Of those 10 were fertilized with ICSI and 4 embryos made it to the 5th day blastocyst. We had PGS performed and 3 were considered viable.  I had a single embryo transferred that was AA grade, male, which resulted in a negative test.  I had a BC embryo, male, transferred that resulted in a chemical pregnancy.  I had the final CC embryo transferred that resulted in our wonderful daughter. standard ivf retrievals follistim/menopur high doses not variation other than the day I was triggered. I know this IVF cycle was a little more aggressive then my first cycle because we were trying to get more eggs, so we could freeze some in case we want more children.  I was happy with how Dr. Lederman handled all my procedures and medication.  I think it was an antagonist protocol; Drugs - Gonal F, Generelix, Menopur, Leuprolide, HCG, Estrace, Progestrone in Oil, Medrol; Results - 29 eggs retrieved out of which 8 were good embryos; 1st transfer of the best embryo was successful. I did clomid without IUI at another fertility clinic. I had a chemical pregnancy as a result. I ended up changing providers to Dr Lederman at RMA because of the higher success rates. We did 2 rounds of femara with IUI (negative pregnancy test) and then decided to be more aggressive and move to IVF. We used lupron and Ganirelix to suppress the LH surge and ovulation, then follistim and menopur to mature multiple eggs, then HCG for the maturation of the egg.  I had 9 eggs retrieved. Of the 9 eggs, 7 were fertilized. 6 made it to the blastocyst stage. Of those 6, four of the embryos were viable (2 were aneuploid). I had 1 frozen embryo transferred 2 months  later and it successfully implanted. We now have a beautiful daughter!We did one IUI, with letrazole and trigger shot. After realizing extent of male factor issue IVF was recommended. 

1 retrieval cycles with, PGS and  ICSI (10 eggs retrieved, 3 to day 5, none genetically normal after PGS testing). Used gonal F, cetratide, menopur. I was a slow responder. 

Second cycle he changed protocol to lupron micro flare with much higher doses of gonal F and menopur as I was a slow responder, as he felt I had a diagnosis of poor egg quality. This time we had 14 eggs retrieved, 6 to day 5, 3 were genetically normal after PGS testing). 

1st transfer with 1 embryo was successful- currently I am 10 weeks pregnant with a little boy.I froze my eggs in my early 30s and already had reduced reserve. I went back at 36 to get pregnant. The one IUI was unsuccessful and I love that we didn't waste any more time with that

My eggs didn't defrost well (there weren't that many) and I had to move to IVF. 

Always did aggressive drug protocol due to low reserve. 

My first new IVF only got 3 mature eggs. 2 fertilized and 1 made to Day 5. It was PGS tested and it was normal. Miscarried. 

Second IVF I got 6 eggs with a different protocol.  5 fertilized. 1 was Day 5. PGS. Not normal. 

He started to prep me to donor eggs due to low probability of success. Said we'd try one more time and if I didn't get at least 1 egg - need to switch to egg donor

3rd IVF.  Converted to IUI due to only 1 egg being stimmed.  

Moved to egg donor.  Explained all the options very well. Chose using frozen eggs from Donor Egg Bank. 7 mature eggs. 3 fertilized. 2 day 5s. Put them both in fresh.  No PGS. Pregnant.  
Alan recommended 3 rounds of Clomid with IUI and then IVF with embryo freezing. Since I was ovulating on our initial visit, we opted to try IUI. When that didn't work he suggested not trying IUI again and do IVF. I was hesitant about all the medications, and since he said nothing was wrong with either one of us, we decided to try naturally for a few more months. When still no success we went back and that's when he said- by looking at the original bloodwork- that I had low ovation reserve. We were startled and decided to do IVF as soon as possible. I started meds and went for monitoring two times where he told me everything was good and when my retrieval would be, then on the third he said ""nope nothing is happening"" when I had an ultrasound. I asked what he meant and he said nothing is happening so the cycle is cancelled and sent me home. My husband scheduled a follow up as we were shocked and confused, and the dr was very casual said who know's why and we can try again without any suggestions for changing the process. So we left and decide to check into other doctors.we started with RMA about a year and a half after trying unsuccessfully to conceive.  Dr. Kudesia checked my egg count which is normal for my age and hand me let them know when I came started my period so they can start me on clomid and do blood work on the given days of my cycle.  Since I just started they sent me to get an HSG exam.  On day 12 I would come in and they would check to make sure I had at least 1 mature egg follicle and they would give me Ovadril.  I did the HSG once and it came back normal as well as all the blood work they did.  I did the clomid and Ovadril for 3 cycles, July-September 2016.  I decided to stop until my husband was tested.  He was tested in November and it turns out the issue is on his end.I went through 3 retrievals with Mukherjee. The first protocol he used was the antagonist protocol, which is surprising to me as I've read it is for poor responders or people with PCOS, of which I am neither. The second protocol was antagonist with estrogen priming. Those first 2 cycles resulted in no viable embryos for transfer. The third protocol was down regulation, which I've read is the place where most doctors start but he said is ""old technology"". I ended up with 1 viable embryo (which ultimately ended up in a chemical pregnancy). During the 9 month period I was under his care I probably saw or spoke to him 5 times. He likened the first 2 unsuccessful attempts to bad luck. After the 3rd unsuccessful cycle he's referred me to a reproductive immunologist since my infertility is still ""unexplained"". For this I am thankful because I feel like I might be able to find some answers. I think Dr Mukherjee and RMA is fine if you fit into their standard protocol but not so if you need personalized attention. The overall strategy my doctors recommended was to start with IUIs and see if they'll work before I try any more intense treatments due to my age. However, the IUIs have not worked and I still haven't found out the underlying issues. 1 egg retrieval with ICSI, 6 embryos resulting all PGS tested. First frozen transfer resulted in chemical pregnancy. Second FET resulted in 7.5 week miscarriage followed by a D&C. Endometrial biopsy found endometritis and products of conception, needed a hysteroscopy. Third FET resulted in negative pregnancy testI followed an antagonist protocol. Retrieved 9 eggs and froze 5. Gonal F + menopur with estrogen priming
Lupron microdose flare Retrieval stim: gonal-f, luprolide, menopur
Trigger shot: ovidrel
Transfer: estradiol, progesterone shots. IVF with ICSI for male inftertility
PGSSince we had unexplained infertility, he suggested doing Clomid and HcG first. We need 3 rounds of that with no success. We then moved onto IUI, 2 of those and both were negative. Our last resort was IVF. I was on Gonal F, Menupor, HcG, and one other medication I can't remember for roughly 12 days. They increased my dosage of Menopur only once to get a better response and bigger follicles. I was monitored every other day or so to make sure my ovaries didn't become too large. We retrieved 11 eggs out of which 2 were sent for biopsy and came back prefect. For the transfer cycle I was put on estrogen and progesterone. I opted to take the oral and vaginal progesterone as the progesterone in oil is done with a very large needle intramuscular in your backside. I hate needles so I was very grateful for the second option. We did an IUI cycle w/ clomid. Pregnancy on first try, but ended in miscarriage. 

We went to IVF after that with gonal-F, menapur, garilanyx, and this resulted in a successful egg retrieval. We opted to do PGS testing, and ended up with 11 healthy embryos. We did an e-set frozen embryo transfer that resulted in healthy pregnancy. IVF with ICSI
Follostim
Menopur
Ganirelix
 lupron and hcg dual trigger
10 days of shots and retrieved 23 eggs
8 made it to day 5,biopsied and sent for pgs/pgd testing. 5 came back normal not affected by cystic fibrosis or any chromosonal issues.
First FET-failed
Second FET-chemical pregnancy

Starting second round of IVF now. Same protocol. 

Note: we had to freeze my eggs and fertilize them 3 months later due to sperm issues so we lost a good amount of eggs in that process.I don't recall the details but I did a fairly aggressive protocol in terms of the dose of medication, I had one retrieval and I did PGS on the embryos.  I then did a frozen transfer of the PGS day 5 tested embryo which resulted in a positive pregnancy and a healthy baby girlWe did an ivf with PGD after my last two FETs resulted in miscarriages. I was told that I started to ovulate early and they only got 9 eggs, 2 worth while. They transferred an AA grade embryo and it failed they think due to ashermans. I was angry that he didn’t have me repeat an HSG beforehand so I had one afterword and they saw the scar tissue. I asked him to do an IUI because I had extra injectables and he reluctantly did it with my next hysteroscopy scheduled and it actually worked resulting in my second son. We used Gonal F 150 mg, menopur, ganirelix and a HCG/Lupron dual trigger to avoid hyperstimulation. I ended up with 22 eggs, 13 mature, 2 made it to blast but only on day 6 and 7. They were biopsied and PGD tested and then were frozen. I did a FET that following month which resulted in an unexplained miscarriage. I had the same protocol for both cycles.  Gonal-F (c. 150), Menopur (between 2-3 vials), then the trigger.   Dr. Grunfeld made no adjustments in between cycles which I understand. Both cycles produced a good amount of eggs -- it was just an egg quality issue given my age. We started with 2 IUI rounds on clomid.  After no success, my FSH rose to 16 and Dr. Sandler explained it was time to move to IVF and be aggressive.  
First IVF cycle was the antagonist protocol and I retrieved 8 eggs, 4 were mature, and 3 fertilized. 2 made it to Day 5 and both were transferred, but they appeared to be of abnormal quality. I had a chemical positive that progressed no further.
Second IVF cycle, I used the Lupron flare protocol.  Dr. Sandler believed that I may have egg quality issues, so I took DHEA supplements on my own after asking him about it for 3.5 months first.  Then I started the flare protocol, but only retrieved 5 eggs, and produced 1 embryo.  However, that embryo was the ""most beautiful embryo the clinic had seen all week"" and they thought it to be of high quality.  I am currently 18 weeks pregnant with a healthy baby girl.First 5 days: 
300  IU of Gonal/F  every day ( in the morning )
2  amps of Menopur  ( in the evening ) 

Last 5 days
300  IU of Gonal/F  ( in the morning )
3  amps of Menopur  ( in the evening ) 
250  mcg of Cetrotide   (in the evening)

Trigger shots night before retrieval:
40  units of LupT 
1000  IU of hCG  Formy two IUI cycles I used 100mg of clomid on days 2-6 with the IUI on day 14. Neither resulted in pregnancy, but we have male factor infertility so we almost expected they wouldn't. For my IVF cycle I did an antagonist protocol with 225 of Gonal-f and starting with 150 of menopur all the way up to 300 of menopur for 8 days. The last 3 days I added .25 of cetrotide. I did a double Lupron and HCG trigger shot on day 9 and had my egg retrieval on day 11. They retrieved 10 eggs, 7 of which fertilized with ICSI. I am scheduled for a fresh transfer on day 16. IVF cycle 1: Resulted in no embryos that passed PGS. Antagonist protocol that yielded 9 eggs and 2 made it to day 5. 

IVF cycle 2: Resulted in a pregnancy (currently at week 10). Was a modified lupron flare protocol. Yielded 11 eggs, 2 made it to day 5, one passed PGS and implanted successfully. 

I believe I was on the antagonist protocol for ivf: I had a short 8 day stimulation cycle, and I took gonal-f, ganirelix, and menopur during that time. (Probably others I'm forgetting).  Of course I started my cycle with birth control pills. When my cycle staRted and I went in for baseline, I had an ovarian cyst that delayed my start for two weeks. She prescribed me ovidrel to treat the cyst. I triggered with hcg. I had a lot of follicles to begin with and responded well (except for the e2 spike, which was fine). I had 31 eggs retrieved, 19 fertilized, 12  made it to freeze.  I then went straight to a frozen embryo transfer for my next cycle. I was prescribed antibiotics, estrace pills, and I was on progesterone in oil shots through week 9 of pregnancy.  My transfer went off without a hitch. I didn't do bed rest or anything afterwards.Dr. Copperman used something called the short protocol with me for the cycle. This adds in a medicine called luperon which helps your brain to naturally produce FSH. Since I am considered to be young in the fertility world, he said this protocol can be very successful as my body can be very receptive. In addition to the Luperon I also took menopur and follistim. The short protocol also doesn't require estrogen beforehand or ovulation tracking. I was also put on the pill for two weeks before my cycle to jump start my cycle. 1) IVF-- my husband had testicular cancer and so his sperm count was low.  Our first cycle was stopped as I was told my eggs weren't developing as a ""cohort"".  Two eggs were ""racing ahead of the pack"" and Dr. Lederman felt like due to my age and health, we could do better. It was converted to an IUI where I had a negative home pregnancy test and the dr's office had a low positive (chemical pregnancy most likely).
2) Once I got my period I was put on birth control (pill) for about 2.5 weeks and then started hormone injections again.  It took longer than anticipated before they did the egg retrieval (we were told about 10 days, it was 14 before my retrieval). My egg retrieval was extremely painful and I couldn't move and was in the worst pain of my life for several days.  Nobody would prescribe me anything for the pain (various other materials I read online said other patients at other clinics were always sent home with an rx painkiller). I had also been told this procedure is ""painless"". They got 12 eggs, 10 were mature enough to fertilize (ICSI), 8 were successful, 6 grew, and we wound up with 2 the day-of. The doctor who did our transfer, literally as they were wheeling me out of the waiting area and into the transfer room, said ""oh we want to put both back"" so my husband and I didn't really have time to even think about it.  We had been told, for years, that only ONE egg would ever be transferred.
3) This resulted in an ectopic pregnancy and the most difficult time of our lives.  The pregnancy test came back low positive (hcg about 8) so they told me it didn't work.  Then my numbers continued to triple every 2-3 days and make huge jumps.  This whole time I was in for monitoring every 2-3 days where various doctors, who were not my doctor, would tell me they didn't know what was wrong but something definitely was even though my numbers were in the normal range. I was repeatedly told they ""couldn't find it"" (the sac). After a couple weeks of this (getting good new the numbers were rising and then terrible news that they were convinced something was terribly wrong because they couldn't see anything) I was sent to an ultrasound clinic with higher tech machines as, after weeks of torture, my doctors office finally informed me that their machines aren't good enough to see anything that early anyway (!!!!). This place found an ectopic pregnancy in my left tube. I had two shots of methotrexate that evening and we had to stop trying for three months.
4) After three months, we went back to Dr. Lederman and said at this time we are only willing to try IUI (something less invasive). We are in the middle of our first cycle with Clomid.IUI: 5 days of Letrozole, then monitoring. IUI done when I had 2 or 3 eggs maturing. (Ended up in pregnancy - my third, but miscarriage at 6w1d). Rationale was not to use injectables for an IUI cycle, as those tend to result in multiples which is risky. So we just gave my ovaries a little push and it worked! But the embryo was abnormal (tested fetus after miscarriage and was missing part of the 8th chromosome) so IUI didn't seem to be for us. We needed to move on to IVF with genetic testing. 

Egg retrieval #1: 150 gonal F and 2 vials of menopur. Then a few days later added in a 3rd vial of menopur and also gonarelix. Egg retrieval on day 13. 10 eggs/8 mature/5 fertilized/1 made it to day 6/0 tested genetically normal. :(

Egg retrieval #2: 225 gonal F and 2 vials of menopur. Then a few days later added in a 3rd vial of menopur and also gonarelix. Egg retrieval on day 14. 24 eggs/20 mature/17 fertilized/6 made it to day 6/2 tested genetically normal (grades CB and DA). Rationale was to try and get more eggs than the first retrieval - which worked, and gave us at least a few ""normal"" ones. 

Decision as to whether we should transfer one of the ""normal"" embryos, or if we should try to bank a few more ""normal"" embryos before a transfer. Opted to bank.

Egg retrieval #3: 200 gonal F and 2 vials of menopur. Then a few days later added in a 3rd vial of menopur and also gonarelix. Egg retrieval on day 14. 10 eggs/10 mature/8 fertilized/5 made it to day 6/3 tested genetically normal (grades AB, BB, BC). Rationale was to get better quality eggs, rather than quantity. It worked! This was by far my best cycle in terms of embryology results. At this point we had 5 ""normal"" embryos frozen (although he said the DA looked really bad - and in all his years of doing this he's only seen a viable pregnancy with a D embryo twice. 

Transfer #1: 2 mg estrace taken twice a day. A few days later upped it to 2 mg of estrace three times a day. 5 days before transfer started 50 mg progesterone intramuscular shot once a day/16 mg Medrol for 7 days/1000 mg Azithromycen once. Transfer of BB embryo that thawed to an AA embryo. Lining was at 10mm. Resulted in positive pregnancy test (my 4th) but it didn't stick. Doctor said this was a fluke or bad luck that it didn't work - that with a genetically ""normal"" AA embryo with 10mm lining (and nothing else structurally wrong with me) this should have worked. 

Transfer #2: Same protocol as above, however upped to 75 mg progesterone when mine tested slightly low. Transfer of AB embryo that thawed the same. Lining was at 9mm. This one worked! (My fifth pregnancy). As of this writing I'm almost 16 weeks pregnant. 

We started with three cycles of IUI using the pill Letrozol and Ovidrel for the trigger shot. I was told each time I went for monitoring that I was responding well to the medication, but got a negative result each time.  I don't recall having any side effects from the Letrozol. I bruised at the injection site from the Ovidrel (but I bruise easily in general). Then we moved on to a traditional IVF cycle.  We used Follistim, Menopur, Cetrotide, and Ovidrel again for the trigger shot.  Giving the shots to myself wasn't as bad as I expected.  I bruised at the injection sites (which you should try to vary as much as possible to avoid injuring the same spot repeatedly) and was sometimes red and irritated as well.  I had a very ""full"" feeling with the injections (which I was told was normal bloating) and was sometimes uncomfortable for a few minutes after each shot (mostly with the Menopur and Cetrotide).  We got 9 eggs from this cycle, and at the time were told this was a good number.  Unfortunately, only 4 fertilized with ICSI (my husband had testicular cancer in 2013 so they did this because of his medical history) and by the time day 5 came around for the transfer only one was left (it was not at blastocyst stage yet, but they transferred it because it was all that we had and said there was still a chance that we could get pregnant).  We did not, however.  When we met with Dr. Sandler for a follow-up we were told that 9 eggs was not really a good number (not sure why we were told at the time that it was) and for someone my age and without any other obvious health issues they would have expected more (a doctor we saw before beginning this whole process brought up the idea of endometriosis but Dr. Sandler felt strongly that he did not need to investigate this further).  We were also told that my right and left ovaries produced a different number of eggs during this cycle.  Dr. Sandler said he would like to see more egg production and more even production between the two ovaries so he recommended another round of IVF but using what they called a ""flare protocol"".  So for IVF round 2, I went on a birth control pill for about 20 days first (this is supposed to shut the whole system down so that when the injections begin, the system is ""flared"" up and made to produce more eggs and with evenness between the ovaries).  Then I did injections again, but this time using Lupron, Follistim, Menopur and then Ovidrel for the trigger shot.  This time 13 eggs were retrieved, 8 fertilized with ICSI and 3 remained at the time of transfer.  Dr. Sandler recommended that we transfer two embryos (this time they made it to the blastocyst stage) so we did.  The third was allowed to mature another day and was frozen on day 6.  I should also mention that with all rounds I also used Medrol, Endometrin, and Prometrium after the transfers (I also took a single dose of an antibiotic with each round).  Again, we got a negative pregnancy test.  We met with Dr. Sandler again and were told that the one embryo that was frozen made it to a very good stage (all embryos are given a rating based on their development) and he recommended that we transfer that frozen embryo.  So we did.  I took Estradiol and then used the same progesterone as with the fresh transfers.  Again, a negative pregnancy test.  We used all of our available insurance benefits and also paid a lot of money out of pocket with Dr. Sandler.  So after many failed attempts we decided to try a different doctor just to have a fresh set of eyes look at our case. I started with the pill for 3 weeks, which was based on my low AMH numbers. Then I did a standard protocol for a long cycle (meds were very costly). I had 3 eggs we hoped to retrieve and we only got one. I would love to be able to say, but Dr. Stein never explained any of this to me and when I asked he got defensive and asked me to leave his office, as I noted above.    I later received my paper records from RMA, but there is no rationale for the protocol.  We had 3 unsuccessful IUI cycles.  We were preparing for IVF, but my insurance changed and the new insurance would not cover the procedure.Honestly, I don't remember all the details. But she described everything well and I opted for the conservative choices and I paid extra expenses to try to maximize my potential success, including genetic testing and ICSI. My only regret (not her fault at all) is that I feel I spent too much time on IUIs and should have gone to IVF sooner. She had recommended this but was totally understanding of my choice not to.1 Clomid cycle with IUI, 3 letrozole cycles with IUI, and 1 last letrozole cycle with TI (because I felt that we were headed for IVF anyway and didn't want to waste money on another IUI). Then, IVF/ICSI with PGS on antagonist protocol (preceded by 10-14 days of OCP), using max dosage of stims because -- as it turned out -- I have DOR! This was never verbalized to me until after the first cycle failed. Good thing I read all those journal articles because I had figured that out myself. The next cycle was supposed to be micro dose Lupron flare protocol preceded by OCP again. he used a standard antagonist high dose with no priming. I have DOR and a low AFC but he never explained his rationale. I couldn't even find out which protocol I was on till a few days before the cycle - there was next to no communication. I only produced three follicles but again he never told me what to expect and i never saw the same doctor twice so being in the dark completely was a horrible feeling during this process.Can't remember exact protocols.  But it was pretty standard IVF stuff.  As I'm under 30 and was having irregular cycles, with no other medical tests pointing to any other fertility issues, we started with clomid.  After the clomid didn't seem to regulate my cycles, we switched to letrozole. 

 After 3 cycles of letrozole at various dosages with no success, Flisser discussed with us other options and helped us settle on adding IUI.   He didn't feel at that point we needed to jump into the invasive process of IVF as due to our age, time was not of an essence.  

After 3 failed IUI cycles and a diagnosis of ""unexplained infertility,"" we again discussed our options.  While, Flisser said there is no medical reason that the IUI wouldn't probably eventually work and that due to our age, we didn't need to rush, he advised that if we moved to IVF we might have success sooner.  In our age group, he's had great success with very few retrieval and transfer cycles (that often there's some unexplained reason why the fertilized egg doesn't mesh correctly, but once embryos are made , the success rate is strong).  Using this information, we decided to  move onto IVF, with PGD (this would confirm that all implanted embryos would be potentially viable).  

We used the antagonist protocol.   We had 25 eggs retrieved, 17 were fertilized, 5 made to freezing at day 5, and 4 passed the PGD testing. With those results, we decided to move forward with the transfer. 

In good news, I'm currently 24weeks pregnant off of our first transfer.   I don't remember the specifics .  It involved high doses of Gonal-F and estrogen priming and something else .  It didn't seem particularly well suited for my diminished ovarian reserve diagnosis although I think from flexor's point of view the high doses were targeted to my non-receptive ovaries .First cycle - Lupron Flare. Birth Control Pills to shut off my natural cycle, then low dose of lupron. Follistrum and menopure were used to stimulate ovaries. Trigger shot of orvidrel. This cycle was cancelled prior to retrieval, because I only had one follicle. It was suspected that the birth control pills suppressed me too much. 

2nd cycle - antagonist with Clomid added. This was my best cycle  - 6 eggs retrieved, 4 fertilized. We transferred 2 good quality 3 day embryos. I got pregnant with a singleton, but ended up loosing the baby at 25 weeks gestation due to early onset preeclampsia and growth restriction. 

3rd cycle - antagonist with clomid. 2 eggs retrieved, 1mature. Nothing fertilized. 

4th cycle - antagonist with estrogen patches to try and prime my overies. 4 eggs retrieved, 2 fertilized, 2 transferred. I had a negative pregnancy test. Because I have irregular cycles and anovulation, we needed to control the flow of hormones in my follicular phase so that one or more matured appropriately. Because I have PCOS, we also needed to be careful not to stimulate the growth of too many follicles at once. 

Clomid is often prescribed as a first line of treatment to encourage the growth of at least one follicle. In my case, since I have so many follicles on each ovary from having PCOS, I had researched and Dr Mukherjee recommended Femara (Letrozole) which is better at producing a single mature follicle. On Day 4 of my cycle (because it happened to fall on the day of my appointment and he gave me the prescription right then and there, though CD 3 is more common) I started taking Femara pills and took them for 5 days. 

The next step was to return to the office to monitor the growth of my follicles. They were hardly growing, which was unexpected. He instructed me to restart the Femara for another 5 days. Another monitoring appointment, a little growth, but not enough. He said another 5 days of Femara, and alluded to trying injectables next time if this cycle didn't work (meaning either that the cycle was cancelled and no IUI was performed, or an IUI was performed and no pregnancy/live birth resulted). 

The 3rd round of Femara--still in one cycle--nudged two follicles just enough that he decided we could go ahead and do a trigger shot of Ovidrel to ensure I would ovulate when expected and do the IUI about 36 hours later. I gave myself the Ovidrel shot at home on a Sunday night. 
 
Tuesday morning (2 days after Ovidrel shot) I had my IUI and two Saturdays later I got a positive home pregnancy test. I did blood work at the practice with the nurses and my beta HCG and progesterone levels were very good. I repeated the blood work several times before I could have my ultrasound. Around 5-6 weeks pregnant I had my ultrasound with a different doctor and he found two gestational sacs and yolk sacs. A week or two later I had another ultrasound and they found heartbeats, fetal poles, etc. and I was released to my OB/Gyn. Dr Mukherjee recommended a specific Maternal Fetal Medicine practice that he regarded highly for multiples (i.e. twins +). 
We used a few protocols.  Dr. Lederman worked with my natural cycle, instead of using birth control pills with me.  He didn't like the reaction that I would have while take the pills and didn't want me to take them.  The medications that I used in the cycles were:
Menopur - used in all cycles
Follistim - used in all cycles
Lupron - used in all cycles
Ganirelix  - used after first cycle due to not using birth control pills ( I have an adverse reaction to birth control pills)
PIO Shots - Used after first 2 cycles due to having better results
Progesterone Suppositories - used in first 2 cycles
Doxycycline - used in all cycles
Medrol - used in all cycles
Metformin - Used after 1st cycle to help with my PCO tendencies

I also suggested taking a baby aspirin and Dr. Lederman included that in my regimen.  

Our first cycle produced very few embryos, due to the eggs be polyspermy.  Dr. Lederman suggested that we use ICSI to eliminate this happening again.  I was able to get pregnant with a singleton on my second cycle and I gave birth to my son.

When my son was 6 months old I started trying again to get pregnant.  I had a very hard time.  I had 2 chemical pregnancies.  Dr. Lederman suggested that we have the embryos tested with PGS after that so that we could ensure that the embryos were were using were viable.  We did one last cycle with Dr. Lederman to retrieve eggs and do a fresh transfer.  Dr. Lederman's group had just been bough by RMA at the time and they had a different protocol for the embryos that was having better results.  We were able to get 5 embryos from that retrieval that were viable after the PGS testing on the 5th day.  We did 3 transfers that didn't work, with single embryos.  Our last transfer we put back the 2 remaining embryos and I was pregnant with twins.  They were born at 34 weeks.  My diagnosis was unexplained secondary infertility so we knew we had a good chance of a positive outcome out was just a matter of the right egg and the right sperm at the right time. I got pregnant on a medicated cycle with timed intercourse (had my second baby). When we decided we wanted a third child and the same treatment didn't work Dr. Grunfeld encouraged me to consider IVF and reviewed my chances of success etc. When we finally decided to go ahead with it he discussed our desire to transfer two embryos (he advised not to but told us it was our decision and I'm glad we listened!!). We had our third healthy baby, on our second transfer.I don't remember.  I felt like the clinic had set protocols and he just tried them on me.  I don't remember exactly, but I looked back in my emails and these were the drugs I purchased:

Ganirelix 250 mcg x 4
 
Follistim Cartridge 900 IU x 3
 
Menopur 75 IU Vials x 25

I did them in varying levels and I had a lot of Menopur left over (5 or 6 vials).  My trigger shot was switched at the end from Ovidrel to the other one because I was growing a LOT of eggs and they were afraid I would over-stim (which I did).  I had a very successful result but it was extremely painful.i dont remember sorry. i think I blocked it all out.Simple IUI, back to back.  I had to get them paperwork in order to have the sperm sent there. I had a blood test to check my FSH levels. Then I went in when I suspected that I was ovulating and had an ultra sound.  He recomended a trigger shot just to make sure that the egg would be released at the right time, being that all the inseminations only happened in the mornings.  He didn't go over whether this carried any risk and I didn't ask.  He did not recommend any medication and I didn't need any.  Inseminations were fine, doctors were nice and wished me luck.  After the inseminations I was asked to come in for a blood test, maybe in two weeks to determine pregnancy.  I got the call later that day and asked how strong the numbers were (someone who had been through fertility treatments told me to ask).  She told me what range was good and what mine were.  She told me to come back in a few days later for another blood test to see if the numbers doubled.  Then at 6 weeks maybe, I went in to hear the heart beat.  Soon after he referred me to an OB practice and wished me well.I was 39 and hypertensive when I met with Dr. Lederman at the time. He came up with a medication regimen based on that and my reproductive history.I am proceeding with using a donor egg and an embryo transfer. I am not sure what protocol will be used for the donor egg. I was prescribed clomid (100mg) for five days from day 5-9 of my cycle. On day 12, I had an ultrasound to determine the maturity of my follicles. On day 15, I had two follicles fully matured and was given ovidrel as a trigger shot. On day 16, my husband provided his sample and I had IUI. I had 4 cycles. 1st one we used antagonist protocol and Lupron flare protocol for rest of the cycles. I responded to better to Lupron flare and retrieved more eggs as well. I went in only for an initial consultation for possible egg freezing.We did a few IUIs (with clomid)but since none were successful. Then we did an egg retrieval and got 4 embryos. Did transfer after genetic testing but it failed. So he did the endometrial biopsy which was positive, put me on antibiotics, and then I got pregnant on my own but miscarried.Due to my situation, she tried to be as aggressive as possible while being safe to retrieve enough eggs to give us options. Tried clomid + letrozole together for IUI cycle which first time resulted in dominant follicle and ovulation with trigger shot but did not result in pregnancy. Trying again next cycle did not produce a follicle, neither did just a higher dose of letrozole. Currently preparing for IVF1st cycle , 
I took gonal F , menopur for morning and night. The day 2 showed up 4 eggs but in the day 5 all gone. And we canceled the treatment.
2nd cycle ,
Gonal F and menopur higher doses and not worked either. We had to cancel it again.
My poor eeg quality didn’t respond to medication.
He always respects my wishes for treatment - eg he wanted to do genetic testing for embryos and I didn’t but was ok with my ChoiceShe has used gonal f, menopur, lupron. This cycle she upped the menopur, isnt doing lupron, and is doing cetrotide. She started this cycle earlier (I was on the pill for less time) This is the second IVF cycle I have done with her.We did 3 IUIs due to insurance purposes. Those failed and we moved into IVF. The first round resulted in zero embryos that could be used. We moved into another round of IVF but only had 4 eggs and body was responding well to meds (GonalF- 225 and Menopur 2 vials). We changed to an IUI cycle which ended up failing. I was also diagnosed with endometritis after the retrevial. Antagonist
Gonal F
Menopur 
Cetrotide
HcG
Leuprolide
Azithromycin (2) after retrieval In my first IVF cycle, we used the microflare protocol that starts with the birth control pill. Given my work schedule, I was on bcp for a week longer than standard. I had fears that this would over-suppress my ovaries. I wholeheartedly believe that my fears were valid. The amount of eggs retrieved did not match my expectations given antral follicle count from several day 3 observations. Trust your instincts!!

My second IVF cycle, using estrogen priming, yielded far more eggs. However, we opted for PGD and none of our embryos made it to blast even though they made it to day 5. Given my history of miscarriage, it was the right choice to try to test all the embryos at the time. However, for the next cycle, we will try to transfer some fresh embryos.

After speaking to a couple friends that were also patients of Dr. Stein, it seems that we were all started with the microflare protocol. Personally understanding the variations of our circumstances, ages and fertility issues, I am not sure that starting all of us on the same protocol shows much consideration for individual situations. Of course, we don't know if he does this for all patients but it is interesting to note.I did not use any medication.  I tracked my ovulation with OPK tests and called the clinic when I was ovulating and went in for iui.  I did a LOT of testing before iui.We had a straightforward eSET when we were trying for our second.  All my IVFs were with an antagonist protocol and although i had several embryos i had several failed IVFs and one miscarriage.I did 3 rounds of IUI without any medicine, just ultrasound monitoring. After that we moved to clomid and an ovadril trigger shot. We planned to do that for 3 rounds and if it didn't work, move on to IVF. Luckily it worked the last round of IUI with meds.The only know issue is my low ovarian reserve.  So we tried 3 cycles of letrozole plus timed IUI followed by a round of IVF on the antagonist protocol.He right away told me that with my conditions (mostly PCOS but also unexplained infertility) he suggested we move straight to IVF to increase chances of getting pregnant. He also gave me the option of doing more IUI treatments, but didn't think they would work for me. I chose to move on to IVF with him and am happy I did so. IFV for egg cryopreservation Several years ago i froze my eggs. When I was ready to conceive I did two rounds of IVF  and was not successful. I then thawed my eggs and that procedure was also unsuccessful. I took several months off to regroup and went the egg donor route. He explained the entire process, the statistics and the risks. I now have a beautiful healthy daughter.I did 2 types of cycles. first without BCP and then with. based on first 2 cycle results, went on to do only cycles without bcp. the strategies ere aimed at increasing number of aggs without sacrificing quality. Standard protocol IVF for both rounds of IVF, but adjusted medication for both cycles as my ovaries were slow to respond. Ended up having quite high doses of medication but helped increase the number of eggs and embryos that resulted. We did conventional IVF with huge dosages of menapour, follostim
Etc. We did 2 Clomid IUIs and then an antagonist IVF protocol.  For my first child we went right to IVF because that was or only option after cloned didn't work. Luckily it worked on the first round. For my second time around Most recently we used letrozole 25 mg to help me ovulate and when that wasn't enough we went to IUI with the letrozole. Took 5 rounds to see a positive result. We first tried two IUIs every cycle - no success.  The 2nd IVF, the Dr. advised only putting in one good embryo, although I had asked for the previous embryo to be included.  It was a frozen embryo with a different donor and therefore, he said the practice wouldn't put two embryos together from different donors.  This is understandable but he didn't tell me until the day of transfer, but he did come personally to explain it to me.First cycle was just IUI, second used ovidrel and IUI, third was Clomid, Ovidril and IUI (I had severe reaction to Clomid), 4th was injectable with Ovidril and IUI (result ectopic). Last was injections, egg retrieval, IVF, 3 embryo transfer resulting in 1live birth, 1 embryo frozen. 1 year later, embryo transfer resulting in 1live birth. After 4 unsuccessful IVF, we thought we had one more try.  We had 5 good quality embryos and even though I was only 34 years old, Dr Flisser agreed to putting all 5 in. This lead to my daughter. He knew the history of egg quality and even though some doctors would only put in standard 2, he wanted to give us the best chance of success.We only went to him for a consultation. He did say we would have to be aggressive. I only had a few follicles.For my last treatment we used a Lupron protocol - the rationale was that she wanted to completely suppress my hormones due to the endometriosis found. By suppressing my hormones the goal was to closely regulate my hormones during my cycle.2 IUIs, 1 egg retrieval, 2 FET transfers (first ended in miscarriage). We changed from IUI to IVF, after we requested because we wanted to get to IVF more quickly. Dr Flisser was fully supportive.He treated me for my underachieve thyroid. He caught on to a downward trend that my endocronologist had missed. He helped put me on a medication to ovulate that reduced and had use complete genetic testing and sperm analysis before successfully completing one IUI.Antagonist protocol
Medications used: Chorionic Gonad, Menopur, Leuprolide trigger, Gonal f, Ganirelix, Progesterone.Unexplained infertility is a tough diagnosis since there aren't many protocols to use. Insurance requires 6 cycles of IUI, so we are going through with that right now.Dr. Flisser put me on a protocol that would produce enough eggs so that we could pgs test them, but not one that would get me anywhere near hyperstimulating.  The rational was that because of my translocation we needed the maximum number of eggs possible so that many embryos could be tested.  He made a plan to bank some embryos while I continued to try naturally on my own.He used menorpur and gonal f. No real explanation or rationalizationClomid for both IUI, pills super easy. Lots of monitoring. 
Then IVF is a lot of combined inyectable medications followed by a trigger before egg retrieval. Later the transfer cycle is also very demanding. With a lot of other oral or inyectable medications. Clomid, trigger shot, and IUI. I asked to add progesterone supplements this round, because my luteal phase is on the shorter side - Dr. Stein didn't think it was entirely necessary but was willing to try it with me.Cycle 1- agonist, 3 eggs, 1 embryo batches with round 2 for PGD
Cycle 2- micro flare with PGD , 9 eggs, 5 embryos, 0 viable out of 6 (3 Fragile x, 3 chromosomal issues)
Cycle 3- micro flare with PGD , 13 eggs. 7 embryos, 2 viable, 1 mosaic, 2 Fragile x, 2 chromosomal issuesIUI with injectables and progesterone suppositoriesStandard IVF with injectable medication because of age and ovarian reserve.  One cycle was converted to an IUI due to minimal response to medication and overall coverage limitations of insurance.Agonist protocol, standard treatment for woman of my age. The most important change Dr. Klein used was only utilizing day 5 transfers for our embryos.  Our prior clinic used day 3 transfers and they were not successful.  He also allowed us to transfer multiple embryos each time, which greatly improved our odds of success.I used the ""standard"" protocol for my first IVF and did not respond well, resulting in only 4 eggs and 2 making it for PGD testing.  He now changed the protocol and I'm hoping to start again.  He has also done a lot of testing to find out why I miscarried at PGD/PGS tested embryo.  Traditional IVF with ICSIWe started with clomid which gave me cists. They said I didn't produce progesterone but it wasnt true it was a cist instead. Then we went to another pill which didn't work. Then low dose injections and IUI servers times that resulted in nothing. Finally 3 rounds of IVF the first 2 with low dose injections and the last I told him to pump me up and that is when we got the baby and 3 to freeze. I do not remember very well because this was a while ago. We did antagonist protocol. He did not recommend Clomid which was extremely painful and the protocol that Spandorfer from Cornell had me on. he used a Pergonal Protocol, and then HCG on the day of ovulation, followed by retrieval and transferFirst recommended I meet with a speciality obgyn to explore endometriosis & then also address a previously undiagnosed thyroid. Then 4 cycles of IUI before IVFI didn’t start the treatment yet.  We are trying IVF. The chances are low but she is willing to try. She will take all the steps to try to make it happen.I had antagonist protocol I had 300 gonal f n 3 powders of menupor and then centrotide and my trigger was ovidrel my cycle lasted 11 day Gonal 300-450/daily, menopur 1/2 vial/daily & trigger shot.IUI with Letrozole, with an Ovidrel trigger. No pregnancy resulted.With my first-memo put injections followed by IUI. 

With my second-menopause injections in association with other IVF drugs for egg retrieval (can’t remember all). Gonal f and menopur then ganorellix very straight forward. Lupron and hcg trigger shot.I only had a consultation with him but he made me and my partner feel very comfortable. He laid out all of our options, showed us research relevant to our questions, and printed out data to aid us in our decisions.He used Gonal-F and Ovidrel.
We had 2 failed cycles with rest in between the cycles because of persisting ovarian cysts.
Glory to God we had a positive pregnancy test on the 3rd cycleLetrozole 7:5mg for 5 days with trigger shot and one ultrasoundbI have PCOS. I'm on cycle 5 of letrozole to stimulate egg growth. Mid-month I'm scanned for progress (which has been great each month) and then given the Ovidrel injection to induce ovulation. The meds are mild and my body is responding well/properly. Like I said, I'm not pregnant yet but am hopeful I will be very soon. Even healthy couples can take up to a year naturally. The Dr. Has assured me that it will happen soon, and I believe her!The major change was from a regular gonal f+menopur cycle to estrogen priming + gonal f + menopurClomid for first cycle. then injectibles for the next cycle. No results for the first two cycles. I continued injectibles for the next two cycles but didn't follow through with the IUIs. He encouraged me along the way, and was very supportive of acupuncture and other non-western  methods.Clomid, iui's and finally ivf when all else failedSorry but this was a long time ago and don't really remember specific details. I used ivf medication- gonal and menapur. Then rotated in certitude. do not rememberSince I had unexplained infertility, he suggested we follow the protocol put in place and covered by my insurance company (3 iuis on Clomid with IVF if they fail). He wanted to go straight to IVF.Sorry, it's too long ago and frankly (and kindly) I have forgotten most of the details. 6 iui - 3 with clomid and 3 with injectable
1 ivfClomid then and now Gonal-FI don't know. I was on the PCOS spectrum, and my husband had a poor morphology rating. Dr. Stein suggested we start with IUI was it was much less invasive than IVF, and believed with medication I was put on (Letrozole and the trigger shot), combined with my husband cutting out marijuana, we would have success. He suggested three IUI cycles. When the three did not work, we met with him to discuss our next options - in the meantime we were in the middle of trying a fourth time as our appointment with Dr. Stein was not for another two weeks after the third failed attempt. He explained that our next options were either trying IUI for a total of six months (2 more times) or looking into IVF. My husband and I did not want to do two more rounds of IUI, so asked that he explain the IVF process to us. After that meeting we felt calm and in the most capable hands, ready to go on to the IVF process... I felt so relaxed that I think it led to my positive pregnancy test with the fourth IUI cycle! We tried IUI at first, but it was made very clear that with our issue, it probably wouldn’t work (however insurance required we at least try) - then we moved onto the egg retrieval, testing and freezing, and IVF. We had our first child with only one round of IVF! Couldn’t be a more perfect child. We are currently pregnant with our second, again for pregnant on the first IVF treatment. Dr stein explained that he would not want to transfer 2 embryo at a time given our specific male-driven issue, which is good because we probably would have had twins (always more risky)I don’t remember specifics for my retrieval cycle. For my most recent transfer cycle, vaginal progesterone was used in addition to oral progesterone and estrogen. I feel that my progesterone levels fluctuated a lot and I wonder if vaginal progesterone was the best option. Especially because this most recent transfer resulted in a miscarriage. Dr. Klein was very honest from the beginning advising that the best course of treatment would be IVF but due to financial hardship we had to try IUI first. We had 1 IVF with, egg retrieval and 1 transfer. The medications prescribed  included: Gonal F, Menopur, Cetrotide, Lupron, HCG, Estrace, Medrol and progesterone in oil.She tried many different approaches with me I really don’t remember them. The most successful for generating eggs was using Clomid for the cycle and then doing the retrievals after. We also used  Sildenafil (Viagra), at my request when prepping for the transfer, which I believe helped me tremendously. I got pregnant using this method.I had 3 different protocols, I don't remember which.  I was told by Dr. Lederman that there are only a handful and we try them out to see which works best.3 iui were not successful. We did 100 mg of clomid for all 3. My 3rd cycle I am not even sure it was working. First cycle I responded well, got pregnant, but miscarried. I had two egg retrievals total, both freeze all. I used Menopur and HCG.

I had two frozen transfers, one less medicated with a previous doctor (that one did not work) and one fully medicated with Dr. Stein (that one worked).Dr. Sekhon was very careful to ensure that everything went according to plan and may have been overly cautious, sometimes requiring that I come in daily for monitoring. I prefer to be overly cautious and I did not mind this one bit. I like the fact that the treatment plan was so comprehensive and created after hundreds of patients - Dr. Sekhon knows exactly what needs to be doneI don’t recall exactly as it has been almost two years since my retrieval. What I do recall is that I was not over stimulated or medicated. That it was just right. I yielded 12 eggs, 8 were mature, 5 made it to freeze and 4 were good. I forgot most of the protocols, but after three rounds of IVF and only one grade C embryo, Dr. Stein urged me to consider donor eggs. If he hadn't come right out and said it, I can imagine I would have put myself through the emotional and financial strain of another three cycles. I'm so grateful for Dr. Stein's mercifully candid advice.Dr. Thornton  checked for everything, she discovered my Hypothyroidism and gave me all the information I needed and referred me to amazing endocrinologist who assisted me thru my pregnancy. She was very sensitive and delicate with me thru my failed iuis and my first failed ivf cycle but always kept me hopeful and explained all the optionsWe went straight to donor egg because of my age and very low ovarian reserve. Due to the timing of things with our donor, we did a frozen cycle. We did the highest level of PGD testing available (with all the mosaic testing.)  I took Estradol (2 and then 3 times per day), thyroid medication once a day (I was not on it previously but he likes your numbers low) and progesterone shots once a day starting four days before the transfer.  We didn't want to choose the sex so they picked what they thought was the best embryo.  I had a positive pregnancy from the first transfer.  Post transfer, I stayed on all the medication throughout the ten weeks I was at RMA, tapering off the meds the last week.  I started on the lowest dose of letrozole to stimulate my eggs to mature, after my body wasn't responding after a few days, the dose was then increased. After responding minimally to the increased dose, we decided to move to an inject-able. I took the lowest dose possible of an inject-able for a few days before triggering with ovidrel. I had 3 mature eggs when the ovidrel was administered. After timed intercourse, this resulting in a positive pregnancy test. A few weeks later, I was discharged from the clinic. I had previously had eggs retrieved from a different doctor.  After two failed attempts we decided to go with another Dr. and that's when we met Dr. Stein.  He performed transfer the first time with me an it resulted in a successful pregnancy.I had low AMH levels and was a low responder during my two egg freezing cycles. During my one IVF cycle where we retrieved fresh eggs, he used a micro flare protocol. I think they retrieved 5 eggs, 4 of which were mature and fertilized. However only one embryo survived a week of growth to be PGS tested and frozen. Luckily it was normal, and this was the embryo that was transferred two cycles later and stuck. I did two IUI cycles before IVF. Each was with Letrozole and a trigger shot.We tried IUI first for 5 cycles, I was able to get the IUI procedure for the first 3 cycles, but the next 2 cycles was all messed up, e.g. ovulated before the IUI. Then we went on to IVF, did two separate transferred, where the second transfer was successful and now I am 9 weeks pregnant. I feel I get the right medications as RMA closely monitoring my blood level. Provera. Then Letrozole (5 mg did not work, so it was raised to 7.5 mg, which did work). Ovidrel.Drugs to stimulate eggs for retrieval, PGS testing of the embryos, drugs to thicken the uterine lining for implantation.  I retrieved 20+ eggs the first cycle, that resulted in 5 normal embryos (best embryos were boys). I Did a second retrieval (trying for a girl), With reduced egg stimulation medication, that resulted in 12 eggs retrieved and three healthy embryos.  I did two single embryo transfers from my first egg retrieval, the second transfer took and resulted in a live birth.We had one stimulation cycle with low dosages. One egg retrieval and one frozen embryo transfer. The outcome of all this was a pregnancy. lupron twice a day for 10 days
menopur once a day for 10 days
follistem pen once a day for 10 days

Early on, we were concerned one ovary was not responding and that we would have to postpone one month, but, then, it quickly caught up.  
I started with menopur.  Took estrace and progesterone in oil injections after the transfer.We only discussed eSET, I am not interested in multiples because of the increased risk of miscarriage and preterm births. I agree totally with his approach towards transferring a single embryo in our case considering all the risks with twin pregnancies.Unforntaly I have not yet any embryos making it to blast to be transferred. Dr. Flisser felt that if we didn't want to have twins, and weren't in a crazy rush to have kids, that the eSET gave us the best chance to have a singleton and ultimately would lead to less potential pregnancy complications vs transferring multiple embryos. Dr Knopman encouraged me to transfer 1 embryo because I am young and had good embryos. She felt that putting 1 embryo in for 2 cycles was just as effective as putting 2 embryos in for 1 cycle. She prefers single embryo transfer which was fine with me. She explained her reasoning well and has been published on the matter.Dr. Sekhon preferred eSETThe practice doesn't encourage multiple embryo transfers and while it states ""e""SET it isn't elective in this case it's forced. My doctor felt strongly that we should opt for a single transfer unless we had multiple failed transfers. Multiples come with risks which were unnecessary at the time.Dr. Copperman believes in one healthy baby.  I asked to transfer two embryos to help my chances of conceiving, never thinking I would get so lucky with twins!  Best thing that has ever happened to me! Yes. I am a SMC and because my embryos were of good quality the first transfer was an eSET. My doctor had a very strong preference for single embryo transfer. His reasoning made sense, I was seeing him for a genetic disorder that can cause pregnancy to be high risk, so we didn’t want to increase the risk by having a multiple pregnancy. Dr. Copperman has said he will only transfer 1 embryo at a time and that is fine with us. Dr. Lederman is against, and will not allow multiple embryo transfer. He will push you to do PGS testing if you can afford it. Dr. Copperman ordinarily is a very strong proponent of single embryo transfer but on my second transfer, the defrosting process didn't go as smoothly as expected and rather than cancel, they called me that morning to request thawing a second embryo. We did that and then decided to transfer both, which was very unusual for him, as his staff and he reiterated at our transfer. This transfer ended up in a positive pregnancy and a single baby so I'm glad we went this route. I never got to that point with Flisser, sadly.Strongly preferred eSET for us.He suggested to transfer 1 embryo at a time given my age and medical history. I had no choice on the approach to eSet. During my last transfer I would have liked to have a multiple embryo transfer.He was very adamant about a single embryo transfer would not even consider multiple Dr. Flisser only recommended single transfers during my treatment. Dr. Davis felt strongly about transferring one embryo at a time. He felt that we were still young and did not have any real reason to transfer multiples. He always reminded us that multiples come with risks and we were not in a position to need to take on that risk just yet.My doctor did not want to transfer more than one embryo but I didnt want that either. I only had one good embryo anyway so we didnt ever need to argue ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Because of my age they would only transfer one embryo (I’m over 40). He felt very strongly about only transferring a single one. And I'm so grateful that he did. single embryo transfer - multiple pregnancies being higher riski felt like 5 embryo transfer was the best option for me - i was not sufficiently prepared though for the fact that the remaining 5 embryos would not be good enough to freezeDr Stein will not transfer more than one embryo.  He told me this is ""non-negotable.""Dr. Stein does single PGS normal embryo transfer.Dr Copperman was comfortable transferring one per transfer for me. Each transfer resulting in a pregnancy. He was very helpful recommending the right scenario for us.It made sense to select a single embryo that had been tested and found viable. But for my second pregnancy I would like to have the option of transferring 2 embryos. But as far as I understood, RMA doesn't do that. I keep getting asked why my doctor didn't implant more than one embryo, but I think the general understanding of my circle of family and friends is a bit outdated.  He implants 1 to have a healthier and safer pregnancy.  When dealing with fertility issues and lots of patients that are more mature in age, it can be riskier to implant multiple.  We have 3 embryos frozen away to use in the future when we are on baby 2, 3, or 4!Dr. Flisser wants to avoid the risks for mom and baby of a multiple embryo transfer.Well, he suggested that we should only have single embryo transfer since we would have done a pgs testing. I would rather have 2 if it was up to meWe were advised to only do one transfer at a time. Happy to have had single embryo transfer as multiples could have led to a complicated pregnancy We have not discussed this yet, as I am not planning IVF. I did not do IVF yet.She said because we already had one child she recommends one embryo transfer since we do not want to have more than 2 kids. N/A at this time.Dr. Stein will only transfer 1 embryo. We have not discussed this yet. Dr. Lederman firmly believes in only transferring 1 embryo at a time. He also insists on only transferring PGS/PGD tested embryos.MD wanted 1 embryo transferred and i was inquiring about multiple. I explained why multiple and she dismissed it and explained her reasoning. She also reported that I am young and dont need to worry about doing treatment.... I wish she would have explained reasoning for 1 embryo vs.2 and to explain it deeper (in regards to my previous treatments/diagnosis). I felt it was very one sided on that decision and i was uncomfortable with her approach to that.Dr. Grunfeld prefers SET, which is fine. My husband and I had no normal embryos to transfer.He is for eSET, against multiple embryo transfer.Dr. Flisser does recommend eSET and while I would like to do multiple embryo transfers, I understand his rationale.As a 27 year old, she was only going to do single transfers until I had had 3 transfers that didn’t take. She does allow older women to transfer 2 earlier than that. N/aFor me, Dr Stein believed strongly in transferring one embryo, because multiples bring higher risks. I agree with this assessment and appreciated it. (He also has twins himself, so that may bias him).It was hard to accept that Dr. Flisser was only transferring one embryo at a time.  We wanted “insta-family.”  However, he is concerned about having healthy babies and healthy mothers, which multiples have more risks.  Dr. Flisser held a pretty hard line of only transferring one at a time.  We know he has transferred multiples but our understanding is he resorts to that only after multiple failed attempts with one.I did PGS testing on all embroils before the transfer. Single embryo transfer reduces risks and pregnancy complications so I agreed with doing the single embryo transfer to minimize risk He said multiple isn't recommended.From what the doctor said, they only plan on putting in 1 embryo at a time.The doctor told me that they do not transfer more than 1 embryo at a time but when I was waiting to have my transfer I heard him say to the couple next door that they were having 2 embryos transferred. If you undergo genetic testing they will always discourage you from transferring more than 1 embryo at a time. Not applicable as I've not tried eSET.He is a proponent of single embryo transfersDr. Copperman recommended a single transfer with chromosome testing. In the end we only had one good tested embryo to transfer anyway.Dr. Flisser's approach for us, was eSET.I was worried that transferring only 1 embryo wouldn't result in a positive outcome but Dr. Stein assured us that our chances were the same and if we transferred both then we'd possibly end up with triplets or quadruplets. Also, I've read that transferred multiple can interfere with implantation. We did only 1 and kept the other frozen with positive results. She offered us the option to transfer two but said with my age being on the younger side she thought we would be fine to transfer one. We said we did not want twins and she respected that decision. She highly recommended single embryo transfer because I did genetic testing on the embryos.He said right away because of my hypertension he was only transferring one embryo at a time.Not yet Because of the fibroids I have I am not a candidate for multiple embryo transfer. This is something we knew since day one.Glad he only does one embryo transfer at a time. I didn’t want multiple.I haven’t go through to retrieve yet. So I can’t comment anything. But from the beginning. He would do 2 embryos transfer not more than that.No comment here. Haven’t gotten to a transfer yet.N/A for IUIDid not undergo embryo transferAlways advocated for eSET over multiple which I fully agreed with.She strongly prefers eSET.Said he preferred single. Also said that they would not transfer mosaic but you could ship them to someone else outside their clinic to do it if you wanted. Dr Stein advised we only transfer one embryo because it would be the safest for me and the baby.  Because my embryos were pgs tested we only transferred one at a time.He was very clear about his strategy since day one and we were on board after asking a lot of questions. He shown us stadistica and explain risks to go to multiple embryo transfer Not applicableAt my age, multiple embryo transfer should be the standard, to increase the chances of success. I know it also increases chances of multiples, but that can be sorted out later down the road in my opnion. She recommended SET based on my age, diagnosis, and past success. She will lab-test the embryo before the transfer, to ensure the embryo is good.Dr. Grunfled will only consider eSET, at least in my case.Felt very strongly against multiples unless it was my wish to carry twins. Strong preference for one We transferred one embryo at a time (I did 2 transfers in total) to reduce chance of multiples and limit overall risk. Dr. Stein prefers to transfer a single embryo.The RMA believes strongly in single embryo transfer. That appears to be the safest route for pregnancy. That was fine with us. We haven't crossed this bridge, but my doctor and the clinic do not believe in multiple embryo transfers unless the mother is over a certain age or there's another medical reason to do so.Dr. Lekovich was a very strong proponent of aSET. My doctors office will only do the single embryo transfer on me because the embryos were tested for genetic and chromosome abnormalities, so the changes of the embryos taking are higher.  I think that is a safe approach in my circumstance. Dr. Klein is particular to elective single embryo transfers for the safety of the mother and the fetus. Dr. Klein recommended a single embryo transfer due to my age being that I was categorized as high risk. He felt confident in that recommendation and I trusted him. Dr. Sekhon told us that for my age (under 35) and good health, it wasn't necessary to do multiple embryo transfers.Dr Lederman strongly encouraged single embryo transfer. They do not do Multiple.They only transfer one at a time at RMA. It is safer for both mother and fetus. They educate you on why. I wish the rationale (eSET) had been explained to me more BEFORE my treatment.  I think given my weight they considered it far too risky to have twins or other multiples.RMA does not practice multiple embryo  transfer (or at least it was not an option given to me, although in conversations after my failed transfer, Dr Sekhon said she would petition to their board to consider a multiple embryo transfer with my history)Dr. Flisser recommenced single embryo transfer because it is safer for mother and baby.RMA doesn’t really allow the conversation of having more than one egg transferred OR discounting subsequent transfer cycles for patients under 35. RMA only does ESet for amaRMA's standard is to do single ET, but we requested to do 2 embryos during one of our transfer cycles. They reluctantly complied with our request. Regardless, the result was negative anyway.n/a - this doctor did what was best for the individual patient with an intention to achieve positive resultsDr. Grunfeld believes in frozen transfers with single embryo post PGS testing. we did not make it here, but I know he was a proponent of single embryo transfer.We haven't gotten this far yet.He does not support doing multiple embryo transfers because of the risk of multiple gestation. This may not be the case for people with low quality embryos, but when we discussed it, he flat out said no. Only one embryo at a time.1 as we only had 1 at this clinic so wasn't an option to transfer moreDue to only getting two embryo's to blast after being PGD/PGS tested both embryo's came back normal and without the genetic factor. eSET was recommended due to the limited amount of PGS/PGD normal blasts we had and we did not want to potentially loose both of them in a multiple embryo transfer and be left with nothing.Since I had PGS testing done, Dr. Mukherjee only recommended 1 normal PGS transfer. Never got that farDr. Davis was a strong advocate for transferring a single embryo for all of our transfer cycles. Given my age there wasn't a real reason to transfer multiple embryos and the risk associated with multiples was not one we felt we needed to take at this point.Based on my age, it was not recommended to have more than one embryo transferred. I believe it is RMA's policy to transfer only one embryo which I agree to, multiples can result in a high risk pregnancy and my age already pushes me towards that. Dr. Stein ONLY does single embryo transfers. We discussed the trade-offs and I was comfortable given my age and the higher risks of complications and pre-term labor with multiples.I am not exactly sure if there is a preference but all of my transfers were single embryo transfers and we never really discussed it to be anything else. In general, Dr Flisser is open to lots of different approaches, but does work from the overall statistics about what works best for the most people. This is a great overall approach, but may not work for everyone by definition, so it is important to be active in your own care. Dr Copperman would only transfer 1 embryo. He said statistically 1 embryo transfer is more successful and is safer for baby and mother. We went in originally wanting to transfer two embryos so we were a bit disappointed to hear he would only transfer one. However, we only have a few embryos so I think this route is much better for us health wise and strategically. He will not do multiple embryo transfer. He stated to us that it was taking an unnecessary risk. It was ok for us because I agreed with him and only wanted singles transferred We never got to that point - we didn't yet intend for IVF, only embryo freezing.So, Dr. Flisser was extremely concerned about multiple births. Given my situation and my quality embryos he was adamant about only transferring 1 embryo at a time. He thought that carrying twins would not be an option for my situation and he fought me tooth and nail about transferring only one. He won! The only time we transferred 2 embryos was the very last transfer that i did with him and 1 of the embryos was not very good quality. He was pretty sure that , that one was not going to take. And he was right. 
 I didn't get to that stage of process yet, so I don't have good and valuable comments on this topic that I can provide.When we did the day 5 fresh transfer, we agreed to transfer 2 embryos.Given my age and history; Sandler recommended single embryo transfer. I am an identical twin and my mother was in the hospital for months with high blood pressure while pregnant. I 100% was thankful for Sandler’s honesty, thought, and opinion. He agreed to transfer two. I had one high quality and one low quality. Both failed no implantation.  Dr Stein recommended single embryo transfer and also did explain the complication specific to my case in case of multiple embryo transfer. We chose to implant 1 embryo because we did PGS and determined that the embryo was healthy. The goal was one healthy pregnancy at a time. Because of factors such as my age and the fact that the embryo was biopsied and shown to be normal, eSET was determined to be the best option. eSET enables patients to have the same success rates when transferring one or two embryos but with a greatly reduced risk of multiples.He left it up to me after explaining the risks of twins. He prefers 1 but I did 2 in the last run and it worked. Singleton Mukherjee is very pro-PGD (as are we -- I'm 42) and so we never discussed transferring more than one healthy embryo at a time.  We didn't discuss. Dr Flisser recommended eSET from the start, and we went with that.My dr will only transfer more than 1 embryo if you are over 35 years old or have had multiple misscarriages and not tested your embryos. Inoriginally wanted to transfer 2 but he took the time to discuss all the risks involved and it all made a lot of sense.My doctor said I really needed to do PGS to test my embryos primarily due to my age and it being the best safest way to proceed.  I only had one healthy embryo so that's all we transferred and discussed given the circumstance.No. I wish I had transferred them both. My dr. strongly suggested transferring only 1 embryo because it was PGD tested normal. I had 2 embryos that were poor quality but both PGD normal and he refused to transfer both. I ended up miscarrying one. I  have not transferred the other yet.He did not push for single embryo transfers based on my DOR, embryo
quality, and the fact that we wanted to transfer more than one. He knew what he was talking about!!We also used ICsI for all cycles. No commentsGiven my age, Dr. Stein, expressed that he was against multiple embryo transfer.He takes things as a case by case basis.  So I did trust his recommendation along the way.dr. Sandler was pretty insistent on implanting a single embryo. single set was highly recommended and reinforced. None, he did a good job.We did PGD so were recommended to do a ESET because likelihood of conceiving was higher. This was correct as we fell pregnant for both transfers.Once we did PGD he strongly counseled against transferring more than one embryo. RMA does single embryo transfers. I didn't push for more.My husband and I were eager to try transferring two embryos.  Dr. Stein did not object initially....but he eventually expressed his concerns and advised the risk that involves multiple births  We were disappointed and thought he knew best.My doctor only transfers one embryo at a time to minimize the chance of multiples.Yes, Dr Stein is very adamant about transferring one embryo at a time as he doesn't want to risk the patient with multiple births, which I completely understand and agree.I liked My doctor’s approach to only transfer a single embryo as I did not want twins.",7.799999999999984,7.899999999999985,"After our 4th failed IUI, he encouraged us to move onto IVF bc we were approaching later 30s. Estrodiol 2x day at day 3 of following cycle, increased to 3x a few days later. Transfer #5: 12 days of birth control pills, 5 days overlapping with 10 units of lupron. When it didn't work he met with me and we talked about other options, and decided that before anything more invasive we should try another medication - i went on Letrazole and after 2 cycles got a positive pregnancy test.3 x no medication IUIs - unsuccessful
3x medicated back to back IUIs 
1x IVF eset- resulted in 6 x 5 day embryos. I came in after 2 chemical pregnancies in 10 months. She prescribed me ovidrel to treat the cyst. The doctor who did our transfer, literally as they were wheeling me out of the waiting area and into the transfer room, said ""oh we want to put both back"" so my husband and I didn't really have time to even think about it. I only produced three follicles but again he never told me what to expect and i never saw the same doctor twice so being in the dark completely was a horrible feeling during this process. Dr. Lederman suggested that we have the embryos tested with PGS after that so that we could ensure that the embryos were were using were viable. We did one last cycle with Dr. Lederman to retrieve eggs and do a fresh transfer. Dr. Lederman's group had just been bough by RMA at the time and they had a different protocol for the embryos that was having better results. I don't remember exactly, but I looked back in my emails and these were the drugs I purchased:

Ganirelix 250 mcg x 4
 
Follistim Cartridge 900 IU x 3
 
Menopur 75 IU Vials x 25

I did them in varying levels and I had a lot of Menopur left over (5 or 6 vials). I am not sure what protocol will be used for the donor egg. Given my work schedule, I was on bcp for a week longer than standard. I asked to add progesterone supplements this round, because my luteal phase is on the shorter side - Dr. Stein didn't think it was entirely necessary but was willing to try it with me. Dr. Stein suggested we start with IUI was it was much less invasive than IVF, and believed with medication I was put on (Letrozole and the trigger shot), combined with my husband cutting out marijuana, we would have success. Multiples come with risks which were unnecessary at the time. It made sense to select a single embryo that had been tested and found viable. Single embryo transfer reduces risks and pregnancy complications so I agreed with doing the single embryo transfer to minimize risk He said multiple isn't recommended. We said we did not want twins and she respected that decision. I think given my weight they considered it far too risky to have twins or other multiples. No commentsGiven my age, Dr. Stein, expressed that he was against multiple embryo transfer."
26,RMA of New York,cost,"The vast majority of my care was covered by insurance. The RMA finance team took care to work with my insurance company when any questions arose.Majority of the costs were covered by insurance, other than the PGS testing and anesthesia for the egg retrieval. We spent approximately $4-5000. 10,000 plus meds Shared donnor egg : 21,000 usd
Not shared donor egg: 35,000 usd
Plus medication and testing~$15k for the retrieval and transfer. Another $2k for PGD testing, and then the medication was separate, around $3,500The main cost was monitoring visits which were about $250 I think, and the IUI itself. Once I was pregnant, the bloodwork was covered by insurance. I did get reimbursed for quite a lot of the out of pocket I paid for those early ultrasounds since it was prenatal care. I was covered by insurance for IUI and Clomid. I paid $75 for Ovadril. I paid approximately $1400 for hysteroscopy which went towards my $2000 deductable . The IUIs were covered by my insurance but IVF was not. It was over $20,000 with medication. The finance department broke down the billing with line items which was helpful but I wish I had gotten it earlier in the process in order to plan ahead. Some were covered by my insurance and some were not. RMA-NY Shared Donor Oocytes with Cryo of embryos, including ICSI and embryology biopsy fee = $23,880.  Additional $2000 for PGD/PGS lab screening.  Subsequent FET cycle = $3450 ea.  Medications extra. Thankfully, we had insurance coverage for the bulk of my treatment, however we have almost run out of the dollar amount allotted. Genetic screening on the embryos was necessary and paid completely out of pocket due to lack of insurance coverage. We had spent a lot of money on copays and medications. My insurance covered most of the procedures.  However, with copays, medication, and genetic testing I would estimate we paid approx $5,500 out of pocket. Co-pays per ultrasound and blood work as per usual schedule. Right now about $150 per cycle with medications.approx $2000N/aThe total cost will probably be around $20k. We did an IUI with them that is still going through insurance. They will go over the cost of the meds and retrieval for you before you start and set up a payment plan. They have to look into your insurance first anyway to get approval.Around $24k all in for IVF treatment and medications$50 copay for visits, plus $60-$80 for letrozole pills and trigger shot.We paid less than 7k out of pocket including copays Co-pay each time Including meds I think I paid around 850-900 per IUI cycle.
Including meds, ICSI & PGS testing I expect to pay somewhere around 32K for my upcoming IVF cycle$75 per blood test $250 for monitoring, $1250 for IUI, $150 for sperm analysis, 
$125 for phone calls, $375 for in person meet ups. All in all I spent 10K in 2017. I have excellent insurance, so I usually had a $40 co-pay when I would go to RMA, but otherwise all of the procedures/blood work was covered. For the shots prior to the IUI, they were $60 each month (my insurance covered the bulk of it), and the medication Clomid/Letrozole varied between $5-$10 (my insurance covered most of it)My insurance was awful. They said they'd cover testing but ended up not doing so. As a result, I had to pay out of pocket for virtually everything.Dr Stein was in network with my insurance. I had a copay for visits and monitoring.Approx 10-14k per IVF cycle and $25k - $30k for a shared donor cycle. I encountered only the initial consultation, which was covered by my insurance.We had copays and premiums for monitoring and procedures.Between $6000 and $10,000My insurance covered 90 percent of all costs. The costs were very minimal They helped up get approved for a NYS grant which cut out costs in half.Mostly covered by insurance bc we just did IUIS20kI have insurance they said it was $8k out of pocket.I had city insurance which covered 25% co-insuranceI cannot remember at this time. 15,200 or so per IVF cycle Thank goodness our insurance covered most of the IVF process. However, the medications were not covered and were extremely expensive.  15,200 or so per IVF cycle I am not sure We were lucky to have insurance cover 1 cycleI did an iui without clomid which was not covered by insurance but because they didn't tell me that, I didn't have to pay!  Next round I'm doing letrizol which my insurance won't cover so I will pay out of pocket.30,000Covered by insurance (so grateful!)Our insurance covered IUIs, but not IVF. The cost of IVF was around $14,000 plus medications per cycle. Additional transfer fees of around $4,000 per transfer.Total $27K for 1 IUI, 3 IVF, 1 retrievalIt was expensive that's for sure, but I can't remember the specific numbers. Total cost of our IVF round was just under $7k.  This is with United insurance and we had reached our deductible from the 3 IUI rounds prior.Fortunately I had insurance coverage for most of the process, so I reached my deductibles and had a few other expenses. Total spend was around $3,000Majority covered by insurance. $15K per retrieval cycle (with insurance)Each IUI was around $300.Minus insurance coverage it was $10,622 + 750 for anesthesia. We used WIN fertility for all medication.  The bundle gave you discounts which helped. I have a lifetime coverage that was used fully for 2 rounds of IVF. My extras included about 7000+ for medication, 2000 for freezing, and 3000 PGS.Cycles covered by insurance. Had to pay  few thousand for medications and for anesthesiologist and genetic testing They have packages, so for a Letrozole or Clomid IUI cycle, I paid $700. I had to pay for the medication separately. The package price included all monitoring visits and bloodwork as well as the insemination. I pay co-pays and medication for IUI procedures.I paid out of pocket because I don’t have coverage (really, because my insurance plan is homophobic!). I paid $305 for each IUI and sonograms and bloodwork was additional but my insurance covered those. Medications were not covered (about $60/month) and neither was donor sperm ($950/vial). We are now discussing costs of IVF. 15k per cycle +5k on meds. Around 2k more on ultrasounds/blood work/ visits outside of cycleIUI was about $1500 with monitoring (no insurance coverage) and IVF I believe was $23-28K with no insurance coverage.I haven't done IVF yet so I am not sure what the total cost is, but iui was $350. My insurance does not cover IUI treatments and they quoted me a bundle cost of $700 per cycle. I had to call my insurance for clarification, as the ""financial coordinator"" that I was assigned provided my inaccurate information.I had insurance but paid OOP for some services.  I believe ICSI cost $2500 and PGS testing $1500. Unsure of cost as our insurance covers these services. Insurance covered our IUIs and $10K or IVF, plus $10K of medications.  RMA charged us the remainder.  First 2 transfers were included in insurance cost.  Each transfer after was $3500.  Costs included bloodwork, ultrasounds,  and monitoring appointments.  Once we were paying out of pocket for IVF #2, the total cost included all appointments, bloodwork, ultrasounds, and 1 transfer.  PGS is private pay, and any procedure (saline sonogram, biopsy) is charged to your insurance.I had medical insurance and  had an office visit and some testing done in the office. I did not do any treatment.I had some insurance coverage in the beginning (when I saw Dr. Copperman) and so part of my fees were covered by insurance. I think the out of pocket cost for a visit was $305.I received a bill for our second IUI but not the first. He did not take my insurance. I paid approximately $11K for egg freezing, $4K in storage fees, $3K in genetic testing for me and my husband, and $3K for egg thawing and PGS testing. Costs were covered under insurance, but at the end of the day, each IUI cycle cost about $200 out of pocket, and meds cost about $100 out of pocket after coverage.$375-$30,000 Approx: $7000 for each IVF cycle, including insurance co-pays, ICSI, PGS, meds. Including the frozen sperm, the IUI cost less than $1000. Each visit with bloodwork and an ultrasound would be about $40 after insurance.IUI was covered by insurance, IVF will cost approximately 16,000.We were self pay. Only thing insurance helped with was medications (which is a huge help). 

IUI: about $1, 500 a cycle
IVF: about $16, 000
Pregnancy monitoring: about $3, 000
PSG: $150 to do it, than $150 an egg
Genetic testing: $350/person
Freezing costs: $1000/year
4 IUIs $2,000
Genetic testing $400
Meds $300 It really depends on what your insurance covers- mine didn't cover IUI ($500+) or the ovidrel shot ($99) but thus far the sonograms and office visits and blood work were covered . I really like that RMA has a financial consultant to discuss all your financial options available and will answer all or any questions Insurance covered most of the IUI cycles less co-pays and medication co-pays.  We paid roughly 25% of the tots IVF costs.  PGS and the freezing of embryos was on us.My insurance covered almost of the procedures but we still spent around 5,000 for copays, medication and blood work. We spent an additional 5 for PGS testing and embryo storing. 2500
IUI and genetic testing covered by insuranceI don't remember specifically but with treatment and medication comebine we probable spent about $1000 out of pocket (I have insurance)My co-pay was normally $40.  However the sperm extraction done by Dr. Natan Bar Chama was $6,500.  IVF I have not started yet but it will probably be in the $20, 000 range including PGD and medications.Approximately $9K for retrieval, $5K for transfer, $2K for PGD, $2K for PGD administrative fee, $750 for anesthesia, $5K for medications For the past two IUIs, I've paid more than $5K out of pocket to the clinic. That included medications, consultation and the actual procedures performed.My insurance covered my FET but not ICSI and not PGS testingAll in, for IVF (w/ICSI) and PGS, I think the cost was around $15,000 out of pocket. Insurance covered some of this for us and I know RMA takes some insurance, just not ours. I had to pay 25% of care with insurance covering 75% (about $1,500 out of pocket). We also opted for PGS, $2,000 to RMA and $2,000 to laboratory. Caveat: I believe some insurance charges are still pending so...hopefully this is still true in a few months!My IVF was covered by insurance but there was a $1500 co-payment, $750 for the anesthesia and then the medicines had various co-payments. Almost all of them were covered and the ones that weren't didn't exceed $150. I didn't pay a co-payment per visit each time I saw the doctor. I had a a few small ($20 maybe) fees for blood work when I began all of my testing. Our insurance was pretty good. They were in network the year where I had the bulk of my treatments (Anthem Blue Cross). They are not in network anymore, so it would have been much more expensive. about $22,000 fully out of pocketI do not recall.  Most, if not all, of my treatment was covered by insurance.IUIs were about $1000 each (plus the cost of sperm). The whole IVF cycle was about $15,000 plus $5k for genetic testing and $5k for meds.my insurance covered a lifetime of 20k. they used all of it and i never got to egg retrieval. a waste.We were covered by insuranceI think my insurance covered everything but the sperm.My insurance covered 100% the ivf process but there were a few out of pocket expenses. A few of the expenses were things my husband and I opted for to insure a positive result.We will be using a shared donor cycle with ICSI and PGT; Frozen Embryo Transfer at a later date. total cost for the cycle is about $ 29,000.  I pay a specialists copay from my insurance. They accept GHI for City employees.Retrieving and 1 transfer around 15,000
Egg freezing around 1,000 year
Transfer from egg freeze around 3,000
Something like thatEach part of the process was thousands of dollars.Approximately $18,000 for the cycle including $750 for anesthesia. Medications ranged an additional $5000-6000.IUI not covered: $2K. Monitoring and visits covered by insurance. For the whole treatment around $11,000 not including the medication from the beginning to beta test. Unfortunately the refund my money since we canceled my cycle due to my egg not respond to medication.I have insurance. Currently an IVF cycle is approximately $6,200. RMA was able to get all of my appointments and testing covered by insurance.  I paid about $400 for my iui itself.I was covered by insurance, only paid about $400 out of pocket there, and $100 3 times for Ovadril.Insurance covered 90% of cost The costs of IVF cycle were reasonable compared to other clinics in NYC (15k), and the clinic offered to help with grants.  I was able to obtain a reduced rate on medication which resulted in $4K savings$19,000 per cycleIt was expensive. They still wanted me to pay for a full cycle which was alot considering my cycle was canceled rather quickly. We had insurance coverage, but had copays and premiums for: monitoring, medication, PGD testing, and procedures.  Do not recall ~15kMy insurance covered it fully.Insurance covered almost everything! Around 19000 without medication.The billing team is amazing. They were so helpful navigating my insurance plan and even called my insurance company to get information for me.17KNot sure - haven't been billed yet.I had insurance, so just the $30 copay. Progesterone supplements, with insurance, costed about $300. All other meds were covered by insurance.IVF per cycle ~$7 vs. IUI per cycle ~$300 About $4,500 for medication.
About $9000 for egg freezing.
About $750 for anesthesia More than $20,000 per cycle.We have insurance, thank god! So it has costs us about 7K with medication.  I believe it was $12,500 for an IVF package including one FET if the fresh transfer failed. Plus $2500 for ICSI and around $5000 for meds.it was al covered by my insurance dont remember but considered fair and successfulApproximately $35,000More than 20K$30K$500--included IUI cost, visit co-pays, and prescription co-pays.Covered by insurance. 15k plus 2k for pgd and medicines It was covered by insurance except the copay.700 for iui cycle Insurance covered almost everything.I don't remember exactly, but I believe I paid @$12,000 per cycle He was very kind to me especially  after 3 IVF's Over 10kCovered by health insurance.I do not remember Between 9,000-10,000 a cycle and about 300-350 in medication co-paysMy IUI costs were only copays for each visit. First time was free, second time we had to pay for everything- they didn’t take our new insurance I had to pay my copays. IVF isn’t covered by my insurance. Around 1300 $24k shared donor egg cycle + additional transfer required to achieve pregnancy ($3k) + pregnancy visits ($1k) + frozen embryo storage ($1k/year) + required psych eval (few hundred) + meds.$15.5K for egg donor and retrieval (shared cycle)
$10,350 for recipient treatment
psych orientation $300
$1.5K for genetic testing
$40 copay per visit
Medications - not sure exactly but around $1,000 with my coverage
My insurance covered up to $12,000 since they were considered a center of excellence. Luckily, since I only had one cycle before becoming pregnant, I only had to pay a few hundred out of pocket.It was expensive but it is what it is. Only co-pays.The cost was marginal as they accept most insurance providers. We did not pay more than 10 K for the entire procedure. Insurance covered a good amount of the IVF procedure.The total cost of embryo freezing was about $17,000. Embryo testing was about $150/embryo plus a fee. We had 3 embryos tested and it was $600. I've heard others with much higher expenses (RMA uses a third party company).
Most of my regular visits were covered by insurance, but I have had to pay about...$500 or so (maybe more) in testing, which was partially covered by insurance.  I lost track of how much money we spent. We had some insurance coverage but still paid around 15-20 thousand total. I'm only half way done, but so far about $6,000Insurance covered all but $7000 of each round, not including medications which came to approx $250/round.Dr. Klein discussed costs with us during our initail consultation.  However, most costs associated with my IVF treatment were covered by insurance.  I did pay for the remainder of my deductible, which was very little at this point, and for genetic testing of my self, my husband, and the embryos out of pocket, totaling approximately $4000.  The cost of the anesthesiologist was not covered by insurance as she was out of network, and that cost $750 for each egg retrieval.  I don’t remember but it was covered through my insurance except for copays and certain deductibles. Thankfully, my insurance covered every procedure and the medication.I had insurance and it covered 75% of some of the cost. Initial Consultation was $500. 
IVF-$1500, normally 6000
Embryo transfer with insurance $500.
Anesthesiologist was 750.
Embryo freezing 500 every 6 months
Meds- Thanks to insurance I paid less than 1000. Maybe 500-800.
Copays and everything else about 2000-3500 Our second retrieval we paid out of pocket, almost everything else (including all meds for the whole process) were covered by insurance. We probably spent 15K-ish. My one disappointment is that RMA does not accept all forms of insurance, including Medicaid. Egg freezing in general is usually not covered by insurance, so I had to pay out of pocket. RMA did offer me a $500 discount for these recent cycles, though.I was covered by insurance for my treatments and medications (which was confirmed in advance by their billing department), however RMA still required me to pay $2000 (just in case)Covered by insurance.  Probably paid $2K out of pocket.I have thankfully thus far had insurance coverage for most of my treatments- IUIs approximately $400 each, and IVF retrieval cycles were $7000 including medication.approx 14k per ivf cycle not including medsAround $7,000For nine months of care out of pocket expenses were about $40K but that includes pharmacy bills. We elected to do things in a manner that minimized our coverage, but costs would have fractional if we had followed the mandate of our insurer. I had insurance coverage that was capped at $10k for lifetime maximum so paid a few thousand out of pocket at least . I was ultimately able to get my medications covered but only because someone from Glow suggested I fight for it. insurance paid some costs, and I ended up with most of it. it averages to $11-$12K when self pay and all included (isci,pgs etc)Insurance covered most. Copays for medications ranged from $20-$190Some of the treatments were covered by my insurance but this had quickly run out. The costs were reasonable compared to other clinics fo the same category.15,500 for a complete frozen cycle. My embryos did not qualify for transfer, so that was cancelled. So I received a 5,400 credit. Medication ranged about $3000-4000. I did one IUI and that was $700 plus $150 cost for trigger shot. They do offer package deals for multiple cycles.All in all, i spent about $25K on 2 cycles of IVF, and that's AFTER some insurance coverage.  It breaks down as follows:
$7K on doctors visits, procedural fees, etc.
$16K on prescriptions
$2K on a separate procedure (hysteroscopy)

my insurance covered (so in ADDITION to what I spent): $K on prescriptions (this was my lifetime max, and i burned through it immediately) $5K on doctors visits/care which was about half of my fertility coverage
The total cost of treatment (not including meds) is about $15,000 for IVF plus ICSIOur insurance does not cover IUI or IVF, so it would have been close to $20,000 (including medications), but military personnel get a discount, so the cost was lower.$15K a cycle ex meds and PGS external cost (which is actually $150 per embryo which is very reasonable)Costs were covered by our Insurance plan.Freeze all cycle with ICSI & PGD: $ 13, 115
Frozen Embryo transfer: $ 2, 485
Anesthesia: $ 750 I got a discounted rate through the Glow app. It was 15k for the cycle including monitoring since we didn't do a transfer they applied that money to the new cycle making it 12k.    Insurance did not cover any of my treatment. Both freeze-all cycles were approx. $15K + $2-4K for medications. Transfers were approx. $2,500 + medications.This is tricky, insurance initially denied. So the costs of that were 15,000 for the first round of retrieval. 6,000 for PGD/PGS. But then that got discounted because I did not do transfer, so the second round cost less. With insurance finally being fought and won. The PGD was not covered, but the co-insurance was only 1,500 per retrieval round. So for three rounds 4,500. My insurance covered most of the costs, except for a small co-pay.Egg freezing was out of pocket but the IVF cycles were covered by insurance and I was responsible for the regular copayments.My costs were predominantly covered by our insurance. However, we spent approximately $700 to $800 in lab fee copays and office copays and our medications cost us roughly $2000 to $3000.IVF was not covered by insurance so costs were high - around $20,000 for egg retrivel and $4,000 for FET.Most of the treatments were covered by my insurance. However, the genetic testing was out of pocket.The costs were considerable, but we were fortunate enough to have very good insurance and our insurance company classified this place as a ""center of excellence"" which offered it's own significant advantages. We also had a finance coordinator who took care of our billing for us. About $13000 per egg retrieval / $3500 for FET transfer. $2000 PGSD for testing My insurance covered some of my costs . The outstanding costs were mostly the ICSI ,PGS anesthesia and genetic testing .Thankfully  my IUI was covered with my insurance .  my insurance paid for some of the cost associated with the IVF.   I was responsible for paying my co insurance , medication , anesthesia , ICSI and PGS testing .The medical coordinator was good at informing me when payment was due. After insurance , the cost for the above was around $9,000.Very little because our insurance covered a large sum.My health insurance covered my IUIs in full and one cycle of IVF (up to $10,000), however it did not cover most of the expensive IVF medications. For my IVF retrieval cycle, out of pocket I paid ~$4,500 for my medications, $2,000 for the embryo biopsy, $750 for anesthesia, and $750 for PGS testing of 4 embryos plus all office co-pays ($40 each). Billing for my IVF egg retrieval procedure hasn't gone through my insurance yet, so I don't know if I will owe anything additional.For my most recent cycle, I paid about $2550 in medications, $750 for anaesthesia, $13,115 for the embryo freezing cycle, so total was around $16,415. I believe the egg freezing was about $9,000 for the cycle and other costs were similar.So my Full IVF Cycle was 13,750. And my frozen Cycle was 3350. The cost of PGS was 3,000 plus a 1600 lab fee. They are close estimations. 3 times of IUI - $2,000
1 IVF - $20,000Covered by my insurance, but I've used up all my coverage and still am not pregnant.Insurance covered most of us so I’m not sure. When they didn’t communicate clearly what our insurance would cover, we went directly to Dr. Sandler who provided us with a one-time ‘professional courtesy’ (my husband is also an MD) because he didn’t want stress over financials to deter us from focusing on the positive of a successful fet. I had an awesome financial coordinator! Couldn't reccomend her enough! Thank you Joann ndorI am not sure of the costsMost of my treatment cost was covered under insurance, briefly the amount billed on insurance initial doctor visit, lab tests was billed about $1200; Retrieval - around $7500; Embryo preservation (lab) - $1000 per year; FET - $2,480; ICSI - $2500 and PGS - $3550(depends on no.of embryos and was not covered by insurance)  $15,000-$16,000The clinic was willing to bill my primary insurance and then run it through my secondary before billing us. Hard to say because my insurance picked up a lot. I paid $65k out of pocket for all my treatments (1 IUI, 3.5 IVF, and donor egg cycle)US$9000 for egg freezing treatment, plus US$6000 of medicine (medicine was covered by my insurance). Out of pocket cycle was about $18k plus meds. I ultimately got a discount (repeat customer here!) to $12,500.  Insurance covered almost all of it. Very little out of pocket costs - $40 an ultrasound, and $2000 for genetic testing but that was optional.Biopsy fees are $2000 out of pocket.
PGS and PGD is all out of pocket and done through an outside lab. We payed over $10,000!
Insurance covers my ivf but only until a certain amount.They were very competitive and I felt like I was paying the right amount, I wasn't being over charged and I knew what to expect up front.It was over $15K for ivf with PGD My IVF was not covered by insurance so the medications, egg retrieval, PGD testing, and FET was around  $25,000.My insurance covered most of it though I had to $1,000 per cycle for shipping of the embryos, $750 per cycle for anastheisa, and $3,000 for genetic testing of up to 10 embryos.Fortunately, insurance helped out greatly with my expenses.  I still paid several thousand dollars out of pocket (maybe $10K).Approx $18KRMA is fully covered at zero cost under our insurance plan - Progyny. We had zero bills to handle, zero co-pays to worry about. I was extremely lucky to have my ivf cycle and medications be 100% covered by insurance. I think we only had a few hundred billed to us (copays and an u/s at my initial visit).treatment for embryo freezing was $12,000 plus the cost of meds Our insurance covers this. I just have an occasional co-pay.All three cycles of IUI were covered by our insurance and I do not recall the specific costs.  A round if IVF with medications ran well over $10,000.  Payment was due on day one of the cycle and in full.  The anesthesiologist did not take insurance so each retrieval required at least $750 out of pocket.  I spoke with Dr. Sandler at the last follow up appointment about finances and he was able to reduce the cost of the frozen transfer that we did. $14k. They did give me a small discount to get started and they advised about med costs. I can't now recall the exact amount, but with medications and the freeze, it was around 25k.This is important -- they bill your insurance for a complete cycle, so if you don't make it to transfer, it is still billed as a complete cycle. I don't know if it is different for self-pay people. 

All told, we used up 8750 of our 10K insurance limit, plus another 4500 out of pocket for PGS, freezing (even though there was nothing to freeze), anesthesia, and extra meds beyond what our insurance was willing to cover ( I was on very high doses).Covered by insuranceUltrasound monitoring- $275
Ultrasound and blood- $305
Bloodwork- $40

All apt inclusive (not including meds) retrieval cycle- $7500 + $750 for anesthesia 

Frozen transfer cycle (not including meds)-$7500 
pGD testing- $3000$11,000 for cycle
$2500 for ICSY
I believe there was a few for the anesthesiologist as well but I don't remember how much. 

Donor cycle $21,000 for shared, $28,000 for non-shared. My insurance covered almost all my costs.  I had to pay for the first 2 IUIs that I did, because I didn't check to see if fertility treatments were covered.  We also had to pay for the last frozen transfer and the PGS testing.  The PGS testing was not covered by the insurance.  The last frozen transfer was done after I started a new job and we had used all the fertility coverage on my husbands insurance with the first 2 rounds.  Insurance covered my medicated cycles and meds. They also covered my ivf meds. I paid for my ivf via a loan from a charitable organization that works with couples trying to conceive. They work with RMA very frequently. I believe it was $25,000 of my insurance coverage and about $20,000-$25,000 of our own money.we had 5 cycles.  insurance paid for 2 and change but even after that the doctor's visits were covered by coinsurance.  it was just the transfer, retrieval, ICSI, etc that wasn't covered.  Probably 20K out of pocket for all of itThe billing department is nice to work with. About $10k for IVF cycle and $5k for medsCosts are very expensive, over 15,000 per cycle, not including medications and the anesthesiologist. I have gotten a discount through using Bonei Olam, but it is still very expensive.My insurance paid for my IVF cycle except for
Anesthesiologist
PGS
Shipping and return
Standard costs. Other responses here are accurate. Mine were a bit convoluted given he was considered out-of-network for me. IUI was around $800/round.  IVF was $15,600 plus $5,000 in medication.I paid for egg freezing ($10,000), IVF ($10,000 each time). Insurance covered $10,000 of embryo transfer with donor egg (which total cost was $23,000)around 15,000$ per cyclenot much because of my health insurance plan.Approx $8500 a cycleMost costs were covered by my insurance. Medication was not. That was quite expensive.Very expensive, luckily I have Bonei Olam who helps with lowering and sharing costs.3 cycles with medicine and PGD = $65,000approximately $25,000Around $40kI had a grantCovered by insuranceMy fertility benefits were with Progyny, which basically covered everything related to the actual fertility treatments. No co-pays. Then my prescription coverage was through Aetna, where I had some reasonable co-pays. After I got pregnant my appointments switched over to Aetna and had $50 co-pays. I had to pay out of pocket for frozen embryo storage and that was $500 for six months.20kTreatment was mostly covered by my insurance so it was mainly copayments The cost is obviously expensive.  But the two loans we took out to finance our fertility goals made it well worth it.For my egg freezing cycles, insurance covered about half of the costs by covering almost all meds, ultrasounds, and testing. So I paid about $10,000 total for two cycles. My final IUI and IVF costs have yet to be fully sorted out, but I think insurance is covering it. I paid copays of $20 or $40 for many but not all visits. I had one visit with Dr. Copperman where he was out of network with my insurance at the time and I paid $100 for an office visit.So grateful that my health insurance covers all the procedures. I just had to pay co-pay for a few visits. I didn't need to pay anything for the many monitoring hours visits.

28,Weill Cornell Medical College,doctor,"Dr Reichman is an exceptionally intelligent, patient and compassionate doctor, who somehow balances his deep wealth of knowledge with incredible humanity, kindness and humor. Throughout my time under his care he always listened, gave his honest opinion and provided options without ever pushing me, which I really appreciated. I was hesitant to jump into any intense treatments so we started with timed intercourse followed by IUIs. I got pregnant within a few months, but it turned out to be an ectopic resulting in emergency surgery to remove my fallopian tube. My husband and I will never forget how amazing Dr Reichman was throughout the whole experience. On a Friday evening, he rushed to meet us at the ER and canceled his own plans for the night so that he could be there with us and perform the surgery himself. This was not something he had to do - and I knew other doctors wouldn't - but that's how much he cares about his patients. He turned a traumatic situation into something much more bearable and assured us this would not prevent me from becoming pregnant. Given how painful the fertility journey can be, we couldn't imagine getting through it without a doctor who cared as much as he did. Even after this experience (and another miscarriage) he didn't push me into IVF until I felt ready, even though he knew it would give us our best chance of success. Of course he was right, and I got pregnant from my first transfer (which he performed.) We trusted him throughout the entire process and he never steered us wrong. We felt incredibly lucky to be under his care and will never be able to thank him enough for everything. I cannot recommend Dr Reichman highly enough. Communication via email is swift and well thought-out. He takes the time to answer questions thoroughly. and examine the pros and cons of various approaches when you could reasonably choose between several treatment options. I felt very confident in his knowledge and experience and trusted him completely. I always felt informed. Dr Reichman also seemed genuinely invested in the outcome of my treatment and my comfort during the process. He goes above and beyond for his patients. He concluded I needed surgery for a fibroid and referred me to a high-profile surgeon at a NYC different hospital. I was crushed to learn the surgeon had a 3 month wait just for a consult; my biological clock was ticking loudly in the background! Dr Reichman personally went out of his way to help me get an appointment with the surgeon 10 days later, and then later high-fived me happily when my post-surgery ultrasound revealed the operation had been a huge success. Prior to that, we had a disappointing outcome with an embryo retrieval, and Dr Reichman called us himself and delivered the news with the perfect balance of no-nonsense, compassion, and optimism about our future. IVF is a grueling process with lots of highs and lows, and I felt SO lucky to have Dr Reichman in my corner throughout. Dr. Reichman was one of five REs in the NYC area my husband and I consulted with. He was optimistic with my case from the beginning, even when I felt pessimistic. I had come to see him having just experienced my very first pregnancy, which became a miscarriage at 10 weeks. I was emotional but had my heart set on doing everything possible to becoming pregnant again. I micromanaged him. I wanted to handle every aspect of my journey, from the IVF protocols to the timing of transfer. I second guessed his nurses constantly. I emailed Dr. Reichman incessantly with compromises, worries, and left-field inquiries. He almost always answered in detail, which is something that I have yet to come across in other NYC physicians who are as busy as he is. He did not have unlimited patience, but he was always willing to sit down and touch base with us to alleviate fears, or to set our patient-physician relationship back on track after an argument.
Strength: he tries to see his patients during ""monitoring"" hours. This puts me at ease as he knows everything that is going on with me. He will also try to call back your phone call by the end of the day. What I like about him is that he calls us personally with results of tests and what are the treatments. I liked that I don't feel rushed when I asked him questions after ultrasound during monitoring (which could be awkward for some). 
Weakness: I have had 2 failed embryo transfer with him. The last one was devastating as I transferred 2 of my last remaining embryos but I didn't receive any phone call from him. Even just to say, ""sorry it didn't work"". The only call I received was from my nurse that my pregnancy test was negative. I had to do a follow up appointment to speak to him about the next step. I know he might be busy or might be away during that time but days/weeks passed and still no phone call. Dr. Kang is sometimes warm and smiley, sometimes no nonsense, sometimes appears not invested. She is by the book (doesn't believe the research supports supplements, acupuncture, etc). I completed 1 egg retrieval, had 1 cancelled cycle, and about to begin another egg retrieval.I went to Dr. Davis because of his reputation as a researcher, which is impeccable. However, he has so many patients that our interactions were very brief. By my third cycle I felt like he had lost interest in my case. During my fourth cycle - a protocol that I requested - I neither saw nor spoke to him once.Dr. Reichman is like no other. We traveled from Pennsylvania to New York and it was all worth it. From the moment we had our initial consultation with him he gave us hope and made us feel like he truly cared. 
I have not had an easy journey with fertility - 2 natural pregnancies both ending in miscarriages, being told by a previous RE my lining was too thin and so never even getting to a transfer attempt, retained products of conception after a D&C by my OB. 
But Dr. Reichman never gave up. I remember starting my IVF cycle with him in March 2018 and during a saline sonogram is when he discovered I had retained products of conception and told me he would have to go in and do surgery after I completed the IVF cycle and retrieval. I started crying in the exam room. Dr. Reichman was extremely comforting, telling me ""I am in your corner,"" letting me know that he would take care of me during the surgery as I was worried about my lining, and that together we would get through this and meet our end goal of having a baby. He is an extremely compassionate and caring physician, but he is also a realist - he is very straightforward with what he thinks. This is a quality my husband and I appreciated; we wanted someone who would be direct and honest. Dr. Reichman is always thinking about what is best for his patients; he individualizes every plan of care to each of his patients.I came to Dr. Reichman from another doctor only because my insurance changed and it now covers IVF and the other place I was going doesn't take my insurance. Dr. Reichman agreed with the assessment of my other doctor (age-related infertility). Although I feel I got more compassionate ""bedside manner"" from the first doctor, I appreciate that I see Dr. Reichman for every monitoring visit (at the Tribeca Office). He may take a day or so to email back, but he always always responds to email. His answers are short but to the point. He's gives it to you straight so you have to be able to take that, but I have no doubt he knows that he's talking about! I feel I am in good hands for sure. Dr. Spandorfer was pleasant during our consult and took an extensive history for both my partner and I.  He acknowledged the emotional toll infertility takes on a woman and highlighted the psychological/counseling resources that are available at the clinic.  While I had a basic understanding of my diagnosis from doing research on my own prior to my first consult (my OBGYN had completed basic hormone level testing which indicated severe diminished ovarian reserve and high FSH and referred me to the clinic), looking back I feel that Dr. Spandorfer could have been more specific and blunt about my chances of success doing IVF and using my own eggs.  At no point would he give us an estimated chance at success given my young age and diagnosis.  He explained that while I would likely only produce 2-4 eggs per retrieval, there was a good chance that due to my young age, there was a chance I could produce a good quality egg within that cycle.    As we progressed with treatment and moved on to second and third rounds of IVF, I often found that he would present options (ex: medication protocols) and I would be left to make the decision on which path to choose.  I would have preferred the doctor to have more conviction and state ""we should go with XX option given this will give you your best shot"".   I received a lot of ""well we just don't know...""  in my time with this doctor.Dr. Davis was the 4th fertility doc on my long list. i came to him because i was told he would do day 2 or 3 freezing and fresh transfers if desired and appropriate. This was the first time that those options had been offered to me and given the fact that i cannot get an embryo to day 5 in a dish this was comforting. We had one initial converastion to make a plan. It was extended and I never felt rushed. I asked him about the reason that nothign ever made it to day 5 in the dish and he said probably egg quality but not necessarily. He is not didactic in his approach to treatment and has been doing this long enough to remember the days before automatically pushing to day 5 blasts and pgs was the norm. We ultimately decided on a freeze all cycle with the plan to do another cycle immediately following which I ended up not doing because I hated the clinic so much. I told him I thought I had been way overmedicated in my previous cycle and he listened and dosed lower as a result. We ended up having a very solid outcome of that cycle with 10 to freeze. Ultimately the one pgs normal was in that group but it ended up not taking in transfer. For being one of the top experts in the field of fertility, you can understand once you meet him for the first time why that is. He has always made me and my husband feel our case was important to him, and that he had high hopes and reasonable expectations we would be able to have the family we hoped for. 

Our situation is unique compared to some others as we live in Georgia and chose to first see him for a second opinion until ultimately deciding he was the best doctor for our fertility journey despite the distance. He wanted to try an IUI first given my age (under 35) and once we returned to Georgia after the procedure, I had a very rare reaction. I ended up in the hospital for 5 days with what was later determined to be endometritis, or uterine infection. Despite being so far away from Dr. Rosenwaks, he and his team of fellows were on top of my case, in close contact with my local OB/GYN who was administering my care. Once I was well enough to travel back to NY, he had me come in on a Sunday and had doctors there to see me to ensure my continued recovery. He also sent me to other top notch specialists when there were still concerns with my health that were somewhat out of his wheelhouse. The infection did delay our treatment for a few months but I could not have imagined going through what I went through under anyone else’s care. 

We had other bumps in the road, having to delay our first IVF cycle in Jan. 2020 because of elevated FSH levels. Luckily we were able to start in February, and despite some severe cramping as a result of stimulation, I did get pregnant. Unfortunately, the pregnancy showed a low fetal heartbeat at 7 weeks and ended in miscarriage by 8 weeks. It was devastating, and still is, but Dr. Rosenwaks has truly been here for us, calling to check in on me and giving me as much information as possible about a plan moving forward despite the current COVID-19 crisis. I felt like she was on time, to the point, and really well spoken. I felt very comfortable with her. She really is a no nonsense doctor and does not give false hope, yet, gives you all options available.Dr. Reichman was very professional. He responded to all emails promptly, answered all questions in detail and encouraged me to ask questions. When I met him for my consultation appointment he was aware of my previous treatment and was able to give me a preliminary plan on my future treatment. My first appointment with him he looked me in the eye and with confidence told that he could get me pregnant. He always gave me a strong impression that he was competent and knew what he was doing. He was also very knowledgeable about my infertility issues and remembered details about my ovaries, cysts and current treatment.  My husband and I can't say enough good things about Dr. Reichman.  He is truly an exceptional and talented physician, who is trustworthy, caring, and dedicated to his patients.  We felt like we could reach out at anytime and he would respond in a very timely manner to any additional questions or concerns in between office visits via email.  He is extremely accessible and a pleasure to work with.  My husband and I feel lucky to have had Dr. Reichman as our physician throughout this process.   I would highly recommend him!  If we could give a higher score then 10, we absolutely would!  Dr. Reichman is the best Doctor I have ever had in any capacity. Throughout the IVF process I truly felt like he was on my team and was always concerned about my general well being throughout. After our third miscarriage he clearly explained the pros and cons of starting IVF with genetic testing to prevent another loss and my husband and I were on board because we trusted him to steer us in the right direction. He is extremely smart, funny and has an incredible bed side manner. Even during some of our toughest times, he always put me at ease saying, ""we are going to figure this out - don't worry!"". I am currently 10 weeks pregnant with my first baby and have Dr. Reichman to thank. My husband and I did one egg retrieval at another clinic in NYC. From that retrieval we had 8 genetically normal embryos. We did two separate embryo transfers, which both failed. My endometrial lining would not grow over 5 mm. They were trying everything from vaginal viagra to estrogen injections. 
The doctor told me the next step would be surrogacy. 
I went to Dr. Reichman feeling defeated. At my first appointment with him he spent over an hour reviewing my history and setting expectations. He said I can't tell you I'm not worried, but I'm hopeful. This gave me a glimmer of hope as well. 
Dr. Reichman watched my cycle for a month and then we decided to proceed with another retrieval and fresh transfer. 
Throughout the process he performed every scan.
He was extremely responsive to questions via email on days I wasn't going to see him in clinic.
Our first embryo transfer with Dr. Reichman was a success and I am now at the end of my first trimester. I can't thank Dr. Reichman enough for his care and compassion through this emotionally and physically difficult period. 
I would recommend Dr. Reichman to ANYONE dealing with infertility.Dr. Pereira was incredible to work with and very collaborative. I had done a lot of research on my own and had a lot of questions on DOR (AMH - ~.83) and different supplements/treatment protocols. He let us know what he would recommend, but said we were a team and if there was something we felt strongly about he was very open to incorporating that into our plan (fresh transfer. PGS testing etc). He saw me on every single visit and was always warm and friendly. This was also all during coronavirus and he went above and beyond to try to alleviate our fears and make us comfortable. We were preparing for IVF and had me on an estrogen patch for the last week of my period cycle prior. We also did timed intercourse then (where he monitored ovulation and my levels) and between that and the estrogen patch we managed to get pregnant prior to starting IVF. Given that I had previously had a chemical pregnancy, I was still very nervous once we were pregnant and he monitored all of my levels and provided me with progesterone and estrogen support. I couldn't recommend him more. Dr Kang is easily the best doctor I’ve ever been to. She is unbelievably smart, friendly, and professional. She was able to diagnose my issue right away and get me the proper course of action. When I had a failed pregnancy, she diagnosed it early on, was very straightforward about a course of action and gave me no false hope. She helped me move on from that and get me pregnant again Soon after with a healthy pregnancy. Her office staff is unbelievably organized. Diana or a nurse typically called back within 30-60 minutes of leaving a message with even the smallest question. This included days when the office was closed. Test results were always given promptly on the same day and the process of bloodwork and ultrasound was completed quickly no matter how many people were ahead of me. I can not recommend Dr Kang and this office enough. If you are considering or on the fence 100% absolutely use her!From the initial consultation to the multiple medicated IUIs and the egg retrieval and fresh embryo transfers, Dr Schattman explained everything thoroughly, and took his time to answer all my questions in a kind-hearted but educated way.  I only wish he could be the one to have done my actual retrieval and transfer, however I completely understand that has to be done by an on-call-doctor basis. Dr. Pereira is extremely knowledgeable, caring, ready to help, answers email in few hours. I have had so many questions, confusion and worry but Dr. Pereira was there to answer and explain everything with so much patience. Dr. Nigel Pereira is amazing. Would recommend him to my best friend, in fact I did and she got pregnant right away! I have also recommended him to a handful of other friends, and several are already pregnant! 

Having a doctor that you trust, feel at ease with and also know if you shoot him an email will get back to you VERY soon is a blessing and all you can hope for with your fertility journey.   
Also, Dr. P is sensitive to what is going on in your life whether it be travel for work, fear of needles or both!! He finds ways to make everything as easy as possible on you. 

Truly couldn’t recommend someone more -- was VERY upset when I had my last appointment with him and tried to find out if there was any way I could keep him through delivery! Dr. Reichman is the best doctor I've ever seen - in any capacity. He was frank and helped move us along when our fertility window was closing. He was caring and empathetic when we had setbacks or bad news, he is always available immediately by phone or email which is HUGE during IVF. Buy above all else - he's an incredible doctor. His success rates speak for themselves. There is no one else I would have wanted to do this process with.  When I initially saw him for our consultation, he seemed to really know what he was doing and genuinely seemed to care about his patients. I felt like I would be in good hands with him. I was wrong. After my first IVF failed with him he became a different person. Perhaps he thought I was a lost cause. He was distant, snappy and often rude, especially when things went even worse with his new protocol for the 2nd round. He never even followed up with me after. He needs to retire. He is a rude, grumpy old man who could really careless about the patients he thinks won't up his numbers. I underwent 5 IVF cycles with Dr.Reichman and throughout the whole process I felt that I was in good hands and that he genuinely cared about me and helping me get pregnant. I feel that he is extremely knowledgeable and professional and is open to questions and discussions. Whenever my husband and I had questions he was available to talk about or concerns. I think the only thing that was at times difficult was that he airs on the side of being slightly pessimistic which I can understand since he has to manage expectations in a journey that is uncertain. I appreciated that to an extent but there were times where I felt slightly discouraged. That does not mean I don't agree with his philosophy of being extremely realistic. I prefer someone to tell it to me like it is and I would whole heatedly recommend him to anyone dealing with fertility issues. Overall I have nothing but good things to say about Dr. Reichman. I have dealt with many doctors in my life (not fertility related) and he is definitely one of the good ones.He was extremely patient, warm and reassuring, especially when things became stressful. We always knew he was available, and knew that we could always count on him to remember the particulars of our situation. He is a true professional and we would wholeheartedly recommend him for anyone looking to do IVF.Simply put, he’s the absolute best. From the hour-long introductory meeting we had with him to the emotional year-long IVF road that followed, at every step he was present, knowledgeable, caring, communicative, direct, confidant and optimistic for a successful pregnancy.This process is daunting with many highs and even more lows at times and Dr. Reichman got me through them all. I wouldn’t have completed three rounds of IVF and I would not currently be 8-weeks pregnant if he were not my doctor. I’m sure of that.He seemed to have a hard time making direct eye contact with me especially when I asked questions or he was explaining things during my ultrasounds. He was very submissive of my questions that started with based on my research (of which I meant scholarly articles since I too am a doctor, I may be a doctor of physical therapy however I understand researching) what do you think about diet, supplements, acupuncture, and my other issues anxiety, low iron, stress, lack of progesterone etc.  In addition to being very knowledgeable, Dr. Reichman is a very caring and nice person, which was important to us.  We never felt like we were just a random patient.  Beyond that, Dr. Reichman is a great communicator (we could email him, and also he made time to listen during our appointments), and he was good at managing expectations while keeping us in positive mindset.  We also felt he was very transparent and honest about our options. He was thorough while at the same time practical. He caught a polyp that my previous doctor had not. A lot of that is due to the fact that he does his own ultrasound (as do a lot of the doctors at Cornell), which allows for the best possible care. It was great to see him at almost all of our appointments. He made decisions quickly, which was great because it shortened the length of our treatment. He took into account our personal preferences (eg I didn’t want to do a fully medicated transfer cycle so he came up with alternatives). He also was thoughtful about adjusting our treatment, rather than just doing the same thing over and over like our previous doctor.  I had a wonderful experience and am so glad I went with Dr. Pereira. He treats you like a human and takes the time to explain everything, your options, process etc. He is responsive and patient with questions and clarifications. I felt in very good hands and honestly he and the office made all the difference. I can't recommend him enough. Extremely supportive. I don’t know where to begin with explaining how incredible Dr. Elias is in practice and in general.  I’d previously gone to a fertility clinic that felt very impersonal and rushed.  It put off treatment for me for years until I decided on a whim to see Dr. Elias.  From the start he took time to describe what the next steps would be and what the possibilities for treatment would entail based on my anecdotal and medical history.  He recommended an HSG due to recurrent chemical pregnancies - something that was not taken seriously at the previous clinic. Everything he explained at that first meeting made the eventual path to a bilateral salpingectomy and IVF easier.  He was a partner in treatment and allowed us to try medicated timed intercourse for a year before moving ahead with surgery and IVF.  Despite my fears of being medically sterile, I got pregnant my first IVF cycle and am currently home with my week old son. Dr. Elias is an extremely knowledgeable doctor that stays up to date with treatments.  I’ve also never experienced a doctor until meeting him who actually spends time to thoroughly review your chart before meeting with you. There is not enough good I can say about Dr. Elias - he made a miracle happen, but even when we were in the seemingly endless treatment cycles we had hope and trust in him to keep us going. I appreciate that she is straightforward and she showed compassion for our unique medical hurdles that made genetic testing necessary. She might come across as blunt and by the book  to some patients. Out of three failed cycles, with very high dose medication, she lowered it only once.He's very straightforward and has a good, dry sense of humor.  I'm not someone who needs a lot of coddling but when I had to cancel my egg retrieval due to low response, he was sympathetic and understanding without sugar coating things for me.  I really appreciate that quality.Dr Reichman was kind and, more importantly, open and honest about my situation. He never misled me but presented me with the facts and statistics for my age and situation. He was not overly emotional and morning monitoring chats were brief but I understood there were dozens of other women waiting to see him. He was positive and smart and I felt like his guidance was well informed and followable.  Dr Pereira is a world-class doctor that we highly recommend. He was knowledgeable, thorough and methodical, and made tweaks in our treatment to find the best fit which ultimately led to a successful pregnancy. He was a clear communicator in terms of benefits/risks of different tests and treatments and made sure we were comfortable every step of the process. Most important, he was kind, compassionate and accessible, which is incredibly important for patients struggling physically, mentally and emotionally with infertility. Dr Pereira went above and beyond in his care for us, typically responding to emails within a few hours, setting up additional appointments if we had questions, and sometimes even calling us after hours or on the weekends to review results or make us feel at ease. He always took our emotions, questions and concerns seriously particularly when we were uncertain how things would turn out. Dr Pereira had a nice sense of humor, which helped lighten the mood and made this process as pleasant as it could be given the circumstances.

It was bittersweet to 'graduate' from Dr Pereira, as we would have loved to stay on with him as our OB. We are now in the final stages of our pregnancy, and continue to think fondly of him for getting us to this point. There is no question that we will work with Dr Pereira again when we decide to have our second child.Dr Rosenwaks is thorough and ensures I am monitored frequently, he then may make changes to the plan based on the results of my monitoring to ensure the best possible result. Dr Rosenwaks is an EXPERT, and in fact he has trained countless other physicians in his field.Dr Reichman is absolutely the best and we had such a positive experience working with him. We initially had an appointment with him in April but were fortunate enough to see him in February after putting ourselves on a wait-list for an earlier appointment.  From that very first appointment, I knew we were in great hands. Dr Reichman is brilliant. He did an excellent job of explaining the series of tests we would complete and how those outcomes would shape our treatment going forward. He made great suggestions when necessary. He answered all of our questions in great detail and with honesty. He has a gentle way of telling it like it is and we found that to be very refreshing and reassuring - we really put our trust in him and he didn't let us down. I appreciated his upbeat and positive demeanor at 6:30am monitoring appointments and his quick responses to our numerous emails - many of which we sent him well outside of his normal business hours. Dr Reichman is kind and compassionate. When our first transfer wasn't a success he called us himself, shared in our disappointment and really reassured us that this would work - we just needed to try again. Our second attempt was a success! Dr Reichman actually came uptown on a day that he was not on call to do our transfer for us and it was such a positive experience. I really attribute the success of this transfer to him being there for us, not only because he is amazing at what he does but because his energy in the OR was so caring, positive and uplifting. I don’t even know where to start... we’ve done two cycles with him, just finished the egg second egg retrieval. He is nothing short of brilliant, thoughtful, and compassionate. I broke down and started crying when I spoke with him over the phone when he mentioned the possibility of a second cycle... he was kind and referred me to his main administrative assistant who ended up finding significant financial assistance for us. He was also in constant contact with my husband and me after I experienced a rare reaction to progesterone injections. All this in the setting of living 3-4 hours away from the clinic. The only downside is he is not a great communicator... does not always tell you what he’s thinking or why, had some issues with calls back regarding a plan moving forward.Dr. Pak Chung takes very straight and narrow approach to IVF , a process that has a lot variability.  We did 3 retrievals with him, each time it failed to yield a PGTA normal embryo from a total of 14 highly rated day 5 embryos. Throughout the process, we asked him multiple times to consider doing something different to improve the results but he refused.  We are now under the care of CCRM, the doctor there was very surprised by Dr. Chung's approach to stick with the same protocol after seeing the same results in 3 rounds.  I think Dr. Chung's approach may work with 75% of the patients but if you have a tough/ unique case and requires the doctor to think out of box, you should not go to Dr. Chung.  He sticks with the same general protocol. Being a part of an academic organization, the doctors there are super conservative.  They would not go out of their way to help the patient.   Since our first meeting with Dr Reichman we have trusted him, had the utmost confidence in him and have felt like he has genuinely cared about the outcome of our process. He is direct and honest, compassionate and thoughtful through setbacks, reassuring and confident, and pleasant to interact with. He responds within hours to emails/phone calls. We felt like we were a team. I came to Weill Cornell with very little understanding of how fertility treatments worked or what the process was for someone like me who wasn't getting pregnant after months of trying. I'd researched a bit on the internet and chatted with friends, but there was a lot of conflicting information out there and it really seemed like fertility treatment depended so much upon the individual and their circumstance. My gynecologist at the time was extremely unhelpful answering fertility questions — she basically told me to come back in a year if I still wasn't pregnant, and that was that. I was so discouraged and really wasn't sure what to expect with WCM. 

My first appointment with Dr. Reichman was more of a level-set; we talked about my health history, how long we'd be trying and what our options were. From the very beginning, Dr. Reichman made it clear that his objective was to get us pregnant, and he was going to do everything in his power to make that happen. I could tell he was incredibly smart and an expert in his field, which made both my husband and I feel reassured and confident in his plan. 

As Dr. Reichman's patient, I felt cared for and listened to every step of the way. I don't think I've ever had a doctor I've trusted more. I have always experienced pain in the area of my right ovary at first during when I thought I was ovulating. Over the years this pain got progressively worse and more frequent. I was told by my OB/GYN that it was a uterine fibroid on the outside of the uterus in the back and it was sitting on a blood vessel. I sought
fertility treatment from the Chief of a well known health system on LI. He advised me that he wasn't sure it was a fibroid, but rather it was a ""mass"". An MRI of the Pelvis showed absolutely nothing but the pain was even occurring during my period. I had a round of IVF in which I had 13 mature egg and all of them fertilized. A grade A embryo was implanted and it didn't take. We were devastated to say the least. I sought Dr. Elias for a 2nd opinion as I knew something was not right. After reviewing all of my documentation he was able to provide a potential diagnosis....not a fibroid at all but rather a blocked Fallopian tube. Not only could this be causing my pain, but could be the reason my IVF cycle was unsuccessful. He is thoughtful, cautious, kind, caring and patient. All the things that a doctor should be. I am willing to drive from LI to Westchester for him to be my doctor. We would not be expecting our little boy in December if it wasn't for Dr. Elias.  We will forever be grateful to him.  Dr. Elias always called me to follow up after surgeries and several times when i freaked out over results.  I truly feel he genuinely cares about his patients and ask my husband, he was the only person that could calm me down.  You just feel a sense of comfort when he's talking to you.  Dr. Elias is also extremely patient - pretty sure i repeated several questions over multiple appointments and he always answered them without hesitation.  Although morning monitoring was fast, i never felt he rushed me without answering my questions.  Dr. Elias was able to remove my fibroid with three minimally invasive hysteroscopic surgeries.  After multiple IUI's and laparoscopic surgery which confirmed my blocked tube, we ended up doing IVF.  Dr. Elias never made us feel rushed to move onto the next step until we were ready, but also gave us his honest opinion, which i really appreciated.  The first IVF cycle ended in a CP, but was my first FET was a natural unmediated cycle and it was a success.My early reaction, and continued perspective on Dr. Reichman, is that I wish every doctor I had was like him. He’s super intelligent, passionate about his work, focused on results, data oriented, and a caring, communicative doctor. From our first consultation, he provided us with assurance that we had previously been lacking. The road wasn’t always smooth (2 failed IUIs), but we knew that the likelihood of getting pregnant that way was much lower than with IVF, given the data he presented in the first consult. When we had a hiccup with meds/insurance while starting IVF, he personally found a way to get us what we needed, allowing us to begin the cycle in what was a good month. I can’t ever say I’ve had a doctor that has gone so above and beyond. He was always very receptive to our thoughts and questions, to some concerns we had along the way, dedicated to making sure our experience was as good as it could be. Dr. Melnick is at the top of her field.  She is young and up to date on current advice regarding infertility treatment.  She has a protocol she follows but knows when to adjust to meet patients needs.  She is extremely smart and confident in her abilities which as a patient helped me with so much of my anxiety.   I felt he was competent and knew exactly what he was looking for and observing - I wish he shared more insight. I still do not understand why none of our attempts worked or if he had any understanding.
Our first consultation was jarring because he assertively suggested IVF immediately (at 38 years old), but I can't blame him for my shock. 
Throughout, he was very matter-of-fact and direct. There were no elaborations, explainations were as minimal as necessary, he seems busy but always made time for pleasantries and to ensure I was OK.  There were a few times I had to call nurses after the appointment for clarity on next steps.I cannot say enough good things about Dr. Reichman. I have never felt like a doctor was so invested in me as I did with Dr. Reichman. He not only is an amazing doctor but he is warm and compassionate. He was very patient and thorough when explaining options, procedures and next steps.  He made me feel very confident in the choices I made because I felt he had given me all of the information I needed. I also always felt very confident with his recommendations. When I emailed him questions he responded quickly even outside of office hours. When I came in for monitoring appointments he took my work schedule into account and would see me earlier in the morning. Dr. Davis was by far the best RE I have ever worked with. He is the most knowledgeable and I truly trust his clinical judgement. He provided clear and concise recommendations, and I always understood the plan. He was readily accessible for questions, and always called me after a failed cycle. I was referred to him by a physician after multiple failed cycles for a second opinion and I believe he is known to take complicated cases. I completely understand why. He provided a very personalized treatment plan, incorporating my complicated history. I had received multiple other 2nd opinions at other prestigious clinics, and only received generic ""cookie cutter"" recommendations. I was extremely impressed with the care I received from Dr. Davis at our very first meeting. My husband was also impressed (and trust me, it takes A LOT to impress him!) I would give Dr. Davis my highest recommendation!
Dr. Elias offered a lot of guidance throughout the process, and took the time to explain his diagnosis, recommendation, as well as what to expect during the various stages of the cycle.  He was highly compassionate and very human.  I was fortunate to see him for almost every monitoring and he performed the retrieval.  He was committed to delivering the best results and based on his protocol, his initial assumptions were spot on.  I really felt that I was in the best possible care with his knowledge, ability, and expertise.   Dr Goldschlag always seemed positive and hopeful, yet is realistic in discussing options and recommendations with me. He is supportive and kind, and I trust his insight. I liked that I could typically see him for monitoring, and if he was in the clinic on the day of IUI he would certainly do the procedure once requested. Dr. Pereira is smart, transparent, knowledgeable, and has a wonderful bedside manner. He had a consultation with me before we started our work together, which I really appreciated. He got to know me and my background and what I wanted out of this experience. If a question popped up in my head later, I could email him and receive a response in 24 hours, this was a first for me, I have never experienced that before. I could not have asked for a better physician than Doctor Chung.  His genuine goal was to help me succeed, and I sincerely felt that he cared about the outcome more than your average Doctor would.  I spent a span of six years (2013-2019) under his care, freezing and retrieving eggs and transferring embryos, and could not have been happier with the quality of care and treatment he provided me.  There were several occasions where he took the time, outside of office hours, to call and explain things to me or console me when I received a negative pregnancy test.  He is a true gem and a very kind doctor, in addition to being most knowledgeable about his area of expertise, fertility.I was very happy with Dr. Pfeiffer until for one cycle, when we were setting up the IUI appointment she said “remind me for next cycle that you ovulate early” and it just showed me she did not have faith that this cycle would work. I already felt like it was a waste of time. At my consultation, one of the recommendations was laparoscopy and when I went in to try that as an option, she said if I was open to IVF then that would be the better option. However, when she discussed the IUI, I felt like she just felt that IVF was going to be what I did and was dismissive of other options. I thought she was a great doctor, and very thoughtful and compassionate, but I did feel like what she truly believed was not what she wanted me to do. It was as though I was rushing through the IUI’s so that I could be eligible for IVF. Also, there was only one cycle of the 4 cycles I was there that I saw her throughout the entire process. I really wanted her to be my doctor but she was often out of the office. I first went to him back in 2016. He was empathetic, concerned and took the time to walk you through everything and also made sure that you were handling everything ok mentally. He was the kind of dr that would call you from vacation or on his way home to check in and explain things. I will add that we did get pregnant during that time at his practice, however it likely would've happened regardless. When we returned to him in 2018/2019 for baby 2 it was a very different experience. He was overly blunt, cold and got extremely upset whenever he was questioned or I advocated for myself. He just seemed like he was too busy too care anymore. Emails would go unanswered for days and you never received phone calls when requested. It was like I was dealing with a completely different dr. He is thoughtful and thorough,  Always explains everything so I understand.  If I need clarification for something, he explains it.  He is realistic. I am currently still under his care and only starting round #2 of IVF, but he always comes up with a plan with me, rather than for me, and explains his rationale. Dr. Reichman is a great doctor and he clearly cares a lot about his patients and is very responsive. Also extremely bright and has a nice bedside manner. However, he overlooked something that could have saved my husband and I months of trying to conceive. Since I was diagnosed with PCOS on my first visit to him, he assumed that the problem was me and therefore did not recommend that my husband get tested as well. After 6 months of Letrozole (which worked very well for me and got me to ovulate on the first try) and not getting pregnant, we finally pushed for a semen analysis (although he didnt recommend it yet) and found out that my husband had a low sperm count, at which point Dr. Reichman recommended IUI. After 3 IUI's and still not pregnant, WE asked Dr. Reichman if he thought it would be a good idea to see a reproductive urologist and he said it couldn't hurt and gave us a recommendation. We ended up seeing the urologist who told my husband that he had a double varicocele on both testicles and he had surgery to remove them. Now it has been 3 months post surgery and still not pregnant but at our last IUI a week ago, his sperm count had trippled. Howeevr, no we are finding out that there may be another problem with his capscore (ability of sperm to fertilize the egg) and the only way to deal with that is through IVF, however we want to wait at least until 6-7 months post-op to start IVF. In my opinion, Dr. Reichman is a great doctor, but he should have told us from the start to get my husband tested, because you never know if its just one persons fault or both until you get tested. If I had a freind going to see Dr. Reichman, I would recommend that she push to have her husband get tested on the first visit to avoid any further complexities and to make the process go faster. I went to my first appointment at Dr. Reichman's office as a favor to my husband. I was very reluctant to do any fertility treatments. If a different Dr. had been sitting on the other side of the desk I am not sure I would have gone through a year that included several IUI's and ultimately a cycle of IVF that led to a positive pregnancy test. Dr. Reichman has really good personality, which I learned makes infertility treatments easier to deal with. He is super straightforward, has a great sense of humor, and is positive but not pushy or annoying or unrealistic. He explained things in terms that I could understand and answered every question I had every time I saw him. He made something really hard bearable. He was also available to my husband whenever he had questions and they had many phone calls to strategize the next steps. He adjusted our plan as necessary throughout the process and paid attention to what I was comfortable with every step of the way. I would 100% recommend him. I loved my experience with Dr. Reichman. He's very direct and to the point, which can come off as blunt but I appreciated because he was always very honest and helped manage my expectations. He only tells you what you absolutely need to know, and monitoring appointments are very quick, so if you're like me and prefer to be over informed, know that you should come to your appointments prepared with questions to ask. Dr. Reichman really knows his stuff - I always had full confidence in his plans - and appreciated how he would always explain his plan of attack, including recommending that I schedule a ""strategy session"" to discuss next steps if I was not pregnant after 3 rounds of Clomid. He always answered questions via email very quickly and encouraged me to email him directly at any time. Dr. Reichman is a skilled, highly educated and kind doctor. I always felt that he was attentive to my needs and gave me straightforward answers. When we got a few embryos after the first retrieval he advised me to do a second one before doing a transfer, as I had told him at our initial consult that I wanted as many kids as possible,and if we waited it would be more difficult in the future, based on my age. I appreciated that he took me at my word and advised me according to what I wanted out of this whole process. He is completely informed on the latest technologies available and always treated me with complete kindness. I have recommended him to many people already.Dr. Melnick is very smart, sensitive, and efficient. Early on (maybe our first meeting), she told us that she likes to take the stress off of her patients and that they will be monitoring all of my hormones, etc.. I think she made this statement after I had asked about or shown my ovulation testing (urine strips vs. temperature). My husband and I have relief with this statement for sure, but we also want to know and wrap our heads around things. My first bloodwork was uploaded onto MyChart (Weill Cornell uses this system), which was great because we could go in and see - but all of the following results were never uploaded. I think Dr. Melnick’s philosophy is that unless we ask for details about things or have specific questions, she will continue with the next course without giving a lot of details or explanation. (Maybe this is standard practice because nothing was alarming in any of my test results) This has worked out well for us as it has taken the stress away at times. It has also made us gather a list of questions to ask before a visit. Dr. Melnick was recommended to me by a friend and I see why. For me (and I’m sure others), she’s been a great balance of warmth and cool / calm / efficiency.Dr. Kang has been great thus far - I appreciated that she did not immediately push us to IVF and instead took a more pragmatic approach of trying IUI.  She did my first IUI, and then the 2nd cycle I asked to do a double IUI, both of which were performed by nurse practitioners.

One thing I will say is I feel like the timing of the IUIs may not have been ideal.  First cycle was only 22 hours post trigger (which seemed early), and 2nd cycle had IUIs at 26 & 51 hours (2nd seemed really late).  I would prefer they teach you how to administer the trigger shot at home on your own so you can get the timing closer to 36 hours (my IUIs were all in the morning about 9:30-11).  We're still awaiting results of 2nd cycle, but if it didn't work I'm going to push for that.Dr. Davis speaks very fast but he is very informative. I feel he knows what he is dealing, so I can confidently follow his instructions. When I had questions about culturing or not, he explained who needs it and why.  So I can make right decisions.  I also asked if I should do fresh transfer or not. To each of my question, he gives me his opinion to navigate my decision.  In order to reach him, leave a message to his assistant, and he calls me back.  During the cycle, almost every cycle, I see him at least once while I go for the morning ultrasound check ups. So I didn’t feel I was abandoned.  But since he doesn’t take insurance, we only had one time actually we sat with him in his office for an hour at the beginning for consultation.  But my insurance covered it as out of network.  So that helped us.  As I said before, he's willing to try everything for us to get pregnant. I am deeply convinced that he thinks of our situation outside our appointments with him, because he always come back with new solutions or treatment. I have a really good feeling with him and give him all of my trust. I am truly convinced that if I get pregnant one day, it will be with his help. When I met Dr. Reichman, I was not getting a period and didn't know why. When we stopped seeing him, seven months later, it was because I was seven weeks pregnant. He gets results. At the same time, he's a pleasure to see, even when you are at the office at 7 AM on a regular basis, because he is so supportive, encouraging, and kind.After two miscarriages, we ended up doing two rounds of egg retrieval with genetic testing and 1 frozen transfer to become successfully pregnant. Thanks to Dr Reichman we were able to maximize our chance of a healthy pregnancy (and now a perfect 3 week old babe in my arms) because he really dug deep into our case. I was always amazed that he remembered even the smallest details in my visits. My husband and I (half) joke that it took 3 of us to make this perfect baby - him, me and Dr Reichman. He truly is a baby whisperer. The biggest surprise for me was that I actually missed seeing him every week once we were transferred to an OBGYN at 7 weeks pregnant. He gave us our life’s biggest gift and I couldn’t possibly thank him enough. I saw Dr. Spandorfer over the course of several months and always felt like I was in very good care with him. He performed two surgeries on me (hysteroscopy & a D&C) and both were seamless with no complications. I also went through two attempts at pregnancy (1 natural IUI and 1 FET) and both resulted in a pregnancy. The IUI ended in a miscarriage and that was because the embryo had abnormal chromosomes (he performed a D&C to remove the embryo and it was tested). I also went through 1 IVF cycle with him and had the embryos tested, and transferred 1 embryo which resulted in pregnancy. 

Overall, I found Dr. Spandorfer to be extremely knowledgeable, friendly enough, and always made time to answer any questions I had. I always felt comfortable during all my appointments, procedures, and surgeries. When I experienced the miscarriage he expressed genuine compassion. In terms of his style and demeanor, he isn't the type to talk forever and hold your hand. You definitely need to come with the questions you have because he isn't one to divulge or give you too much info unless it's absolutely necessary. You need to be prepared with what you want to know and get clarity on - and ask! Once you do he will give you the information.

He is friendly and tried to keep things light - usually cracking a light joke which I found helpful during a process that can be so intense and grueling. 

I would highly recommend him to anyone who wants an experienced, skilled doctor and doesn't mind that he isn't your best friend during the process.Dr. Reichman made the impossible possible. I had two unsuccessful IVF treatments with RMA of NJ. I was told that will never have a children on my own and need a donor eggs. We also deal with male fertility factor, so our chances to conceive on our own were zero. When I first met Dr.Reichman he examined me and was confident that I can have a child on my own. He did remove an uterine polyp and the next month I started the IVF stimulation. Now, at age 40, I am two months pregnant and extremely happy. Dr.Reichmen is very professional, incredibly smart, and his scientific knowledge is well applied. He is also one of the most honest, humble and kind people I have ever met in my life. Words cannot express our thankfulness. I belive in dr.Reichman and rank him as one of the BEST physicians in the field.Dr Elias had a way of making me feel like I was his only patient. He was thorough, informative, and approached my IUIs with care. He recommended I have surgery to remove my uterine polyp. He explained that the polyp wasn’t necessarily causing the infertility, however the process of removing would increase the likelihood of pregnancy. He was 100% right. I got pregnant the very next cycle. Dr Elias also performed the surgery as well to remove the polyp. One of my IUIs was done by a different doctor in the practice and I did not have a good experience. I explained this to Dr Elias who happened to be in the office the day of my next IUI. He made sure to do that one himself as he knew I was uneasy after the last time. He did not have to do that and I was very appreciative.  After success and having a beautiful baby girl, I am back again with Dr Elias hoping for another successful IUI. I would highly recommend Dr Reichman. After seeing several doctors, I felt Dr. Reichman had the best understanding and approach for my specific case. He wasn't quick to suggest an unnecessary procedure or medication, but took the time to do what he thought would be best for me. He was thorough and explained every aspect to me along the way. His attention to detail and care really shows he is an incredible doctor and I trusted him completely. Dr. Pereira is someone you can trust. Of course, he works at one of the top clinics so you know that you can trust his expertise. Beyond that, you can trust him that he really cares about you as a patient and wants the best for you. I truly feel like his treatment and care is personalized (e.g., he really took into account the fact that we had experienced two natural pregnancies that resulted in a loss and the emotional state we were in). For example, he chose to delay my IVF cycle start because of a new physical condition that came up for me. While we could have proceeded with the cycle, he chose not to because he explained that he only wanted to start a cycle if I was set up to achieve optimal results. Also, as stated in other reviews, he is extremely responsive. He always responds to emails within several hours which helps ease your mind when you have questions/concerns.Dr. Pereira was the best doctor that I could've asked for during my fertility journey. He was candid yet kind and prompt yet professional with all of his emails. Additionally, it seemed like he tailored his explanation and treatment based on the patient. For instance, I prefer to see the facts, the numbers behind one method over the other, and he always printed me a copy of the research paper so that I can read it on my own and come back to him with questions. Overall, while it was a relatively long journey for us (8 months), I'm really happy that he was our doctor. I can’t say enough kind things about Dr. Reichman. I would recommend him without hesitation. He not only is an excellent physician and incredibly knowledgable but he clearly cares about your case. He called me late  and on holidays with results (both bad and good). I trust him completely and he made me feel at ease. We received incredible medical care under Dr. Reichman during our fertility treatment -- anyone under his care is in the very best hands and we would highly recommend him (and Weill Cornell Tribeca) to anyone who is in the process of looking for a fertility doctor. 

Dr. Reichman was a clear and concise communicator -- he is straightforward, extremely intelligent, trustworthy, compassionate and has a great sense of humor; he somehow strikes the difficult balance of being both very realistic and practical while also being positive and encouraging. We saw Dr. Reichman at every appointment in Tribeca (exclusive of a few weekend monitoring appointments on the UES). While the monitoring appointments typically went quickly, we never felt rushed -- Dr. Reichman patiently answered all our questions both during appointments and over email. Finally, Dr. Reichman performed our last transfer himself -- the attention and care he took to make sure every last detail was in place was next level. In our experience with Dr. Reichman -- through the ups and downs of our IVF process -- it became very clear to us that he is one of the best, most humane, and deeply caring medical professionals we have ever worked with. We feel extremely grateful and fortunate to have had him on our side during our fertility journey. Truly can't say enough good things about Dr Reichman.I can't say enough about how highly I recommend Dr. Reichman.  He is very clear, thorough, smart, candid, and responsive.  I saw him for each of my appointments, which was a big relief because my medication and progress needed to be monitored closely to avoid over-stimulation.  He was always well prepared for our appointments, on time, and remembered everything we had discussed about my course of treatment.  He also responds to emails within hours and his nurse is also very responsive.  After you are treated by Dr. Reichman, you wish that he could stay with you throughout your pregnancy and deliver your baby.  I have absolute trust in him and his judgment and have recommended him to many friends, who have been equally happy with his care.Dr. Pereira was great.  He was incredibly thorough with testing (and moved fast with testing, which was much appreciated) and took lots of time with consults.  I never felt rushed as we developed plans, and he took time to explain the procedures, our results, his interpretation of our results, and the rationale for his recommendations.  I really appreciated feeling involved and respected in the process.  He was very responsive when I had concerns--after receiving some disappointing results at one stage of treatment, my husband and I called and were very distressed.  He called back within 10-20 minutes and took time to explain the results (which it turns out were not as bad as we feared), and it was so reassuring. He is also a gynecological surgeon and so was able to perform a surgery when I had to have one as part of my treatment--being able to have that continuity of care was great.  We had success after our second round of IVF and plan to go back to Cornell and Dr. Pereira for any future treatments.  My husband and I were lucky enough to receive a positive pregnancy test after our first round of IVF and we attribute most of our success to the amazing guidance and care provided by Dr. Pereira. When meeting with Dr. Pereira you can see how passionate he is and he really treats you like family. He is very accomplished in his research but is able to breakdown all information so you can easily understand. Dr. Pereira put us at ease every time we met with him. After I became pregnant I was sad to “graduate” from his fertility program because he is such a great doctor.Dr. Pereira was amazing. He always responded to my emails and phone calls within the hour. Never acted like he was too busy. In fact I felt like I was his only patient. When i had my egg retrieval he made it a point to be there & do it himself. I trusted him after our first conversation. Dr. Reichman really knows his stuff. At our first consultation, he had data to support his treatment plan and answered all of our questions without hesitation. Dr. Reichman truly makes you feel that you are in the best hands possible. He takes his time to answer your questions and provides alternatives and next steps at each visit. He put my husband and myself at ease during the entire process. If you want a doctor who knows what he is doing Dr. Reichman is the Dr. for you. He delivers results and is very brutally honest about the process. I did not waste my time trying IUI because he had already told me my chances are very slim and so I just went straight for IVF which saved me not wasting my time and money. During visits, he can seem like he is in a rush but this is because he has lots of other patients. He was always accessible to me via email. Dr. Pereira is very kind.  We felt that we could trust him completely and he would provide us with the best possible information.  Dr. Pereira put us at ease every time we met with him. Our diagnosis came as somewhat of a shock and Dr. Pereira explained our specific issues clearly, left time for questions, and walked us through the best course of action.  Dr. Pereira was always flexible with our schedules and made us feel that we were in control, as much as we could be, as far as timing and how quickly we wanted to conceive. Dr. Goldschlag is a human above all, he cares about you, compassionate, calm, and tells it as it is. He does not make false promises. Very serious, very meticulous and very specific in a good way. I love working with him, I always felt he had me and the success of my pregnancy in mind, while always telling me what the options are without forcing his opinion. I felt like I was a part of the process. What I appreciate about Dr Melnick is that she normalizes this experience, which to a patient is beyond normal. Her knowledge of fertility/infertility is reflected in the confidence she shows when she tells me what treatment path we’re going to take. 
Whenever we talk or email I feel like I’m communicating with my much smarter more confident friend. It’s refreshing. Dr. Reichman takes personal ownership of his cases and wants to be with you every step of the way. He (jokingly) got offended when I went to the UES location because he likes to be sure he's available to his patients throughout the process.Dr. Pfeifer is extremely knowledgeable about current research, and will explain results of different studies and the stance of the ASRM on different points. She is an excellent communicator, very patient, and appropriately optimistic, which helps when you are feeling pessimistic. She has a philosophy of giving anything reasonable a try for a few months before moving on to a new plan, which worked well with my desire to avoid invasive interventions if possible but helped me not waste too much time. Whenever there were bumps in the road (adverse reactions to a new drug or injection, etc) she changed course appropriately, and was available by phone to check in or squeeze me in for a visit first thing in the morning. I felt like she took all of my concerns seriously, and she monitored me very carefully during IVF. Overall she is an excellent, compassionate, and careful doctor and I would recommend her to anyone.In her own words, our very first round of IVF was a 'total bust.' she called it too early and we didn't get enough mature eggs.  Only 3 mature, didn't do ICSI cause she didn't explain it to us, only one fertilized and transferred day 3 and didn't take.  The second round, we only got 3 eggs out of what looked like 10 follicles growing.  I think I ovulated the eggs early, but of course, she wouldn't tell me that.  And she allowed me to believe it was a problem with my eggs.  Those two rounds of insurance covered IVF went up in smoke due to her lack of experience and attention to detail.  I always sensed I had a carrying issue, cause I've had chemicals and not real miscarriages.  I asked for the receptivity and ERA tests on my lining - Melnick told me those tests weren't necessary.  My second private doctor (with YEARS more experience than Melnick) has been able to retrieve 11 eggs, with at least four making it to day 5 blasts. I got these numbers two retrievals in a row.  Melnick only retrieved a total of 5 eggs over two retrievals.  My current doctor also did the biopsies on my lining and discovered I have endometriosis - something Melnick didn't think to look into - even after requesting testing.  I lost valuable time and money with Melnick.  I would recommend finding a doctor with much more experience who will treat your infertility like a medical case to be figured out.  Dr. Pfeifer always had a positive attitude and disposition. She explained what she was looking for and what she found. With tough news she was always the one to personally call whether from the office or her personal phone. Her attention to detail with my personal life made it lovely to connect with her at each visit. I came to Dr. Reichman initially seeking a second opinion, but ultimately transferred my care to him, and I am eternally thankful that I did. My previous fertility clinic was ignoring a serious complication from a D&C they performed after my miscarriage, and Dr. Reichman immediately took action. During this emotionally and physically difficult time, Dr. Reichman was compassionate, caring and confident. My husband and I immediately knew he would be the doctor that would finally bring us our baby. And thus started our year long journey with Dr. Reichman to conceive (successful journey, I'm almost 24 weeks with our little man thanks to Dr. Reichman). A seemingly cut and dry ""lean PCOS"" case at my old clinic, I went from an easy case to an unresponsive and quite complicated one quickly. But Dr. Reichman was always up to the challenge, whatever curve balls my body decided to throw our way. We ultimately moved to IVF and Dr. Reichman expertly guided us through the process; careful not to overstimulate me as I was at high risk of OHSS, but aggressive enough that we have amble embryos in the freezer for our future family. Having now been at the two leading fertility clinics in NYC, I can say without any hesitation that Dr. Reichman is truly an exceptional doctor and person that raises the bar for the standard of care. He is one of the smartest, most caring doctors you will ever see. He earnestly cares about his patients, their mental health during this difficult process, and the outcome. Unlike other fertility clinics, he makes it a point to be the person that sees you every single time you come into the office, and to answer all questions that you have. Not only does he perform every ultrasound, but he will perform every procedure in your fertility journey from an HSG to a hysteroscopy. In what can sometimes be a scary and intimidating journey, it was such a relief not to be passed around to a million different doctors and to always see him for every aspect of the process. It also helped me build a sense of trust and faith in him, which was well-deserved. You'll be hard pressed to find an RE with more impressive academic credentials than him. He is forward with his well-reasoned opinions about your treatment, but also lets you have some say and control in the process where appropriate. He is always reachable by email, and no question is too small or stupid. His protocols are specifically tailored to each patient - you will never feel like you are being thrown into a boilerplate protocol that isn't designed to your needs. And that is because Dr. Reichman takes the time to really think about his patients, what they need, and the quickest but safest way possible to reach the end goal. He always told me to try not to worry and to let him do the hand-wringing, and he was right. I remember him calling me after work hours one day during stims because he was had been thinking about my blood work from that day even after the nurse had already called me with instructions and had decided to slightly adjust my dose for that night. That is the kind of doctor he is. I am so grateful that I had a doctor who I could trust implicitly to get me through this process. Do yourself a favor and just make an appointment to see Dr. Reichman - you won't regret it. 
She is young and relatable, so it feels like you are speaking with a friend and makes the whole process feel a little more personal and less clinical. She was kind and compassionate, though sometimes it did feel as if the appointments were a bit too quick and slightly rushed.
I found Dr.Davis competent and respectful of a patient.  When he had a hysterosalpingogram (HSG) done on me, he explained every step to me even though I might have not understood every steop.   During the IFV cycle, I did not see him until a couple days before an egg retrial surgery.  Because he talked fast, it was at times hard for me to understand everything especially it was about unfamiliar medical subjects.   He, however, answered my questions patiently so that I could understand well.  He was very sympathetic when finding out that our IVF treatment was unsuccessful.  And he provided us with options to improve the chance of success next time.   Dr. Periera was always very kind and sincere.  He answered all of my questions thoroughly and promptly and made the experience easier to handle.  Although I ultimately did not conceive, I do not believe it had anything to do with Dr Periera or his protocol.

With the exception of one thing.  When I switched clinics, my new Dr told me I had a thyroid imbalance and put me on synthyroid.  I felt better within 3 days - more energy; better mood and better quality sleep.  I’m disappointed Dr Periera did not catch this.I feel Dr. Elias is very knowledgeable and I trusted him completely with my care. He always takes as much time with you as you need to ask questions. He actually seems to care. I feel he was careful to tailor my protocols just for me, and adjusted them for next time when it wasn’t working. He took the time to call me personally after my first egg retrieval, and again after my D&C to see how I was doing. I really appreciated that personal touch. I also liked that he did most of my monitoring ultrasounds, rather than an ultrasound tech. Dr. Melnick was personable, professional, and direct. I sought out her practice for an initial consultation in 2016 as I was considering egg freezing. She heard my reasoning, but insisted I pursue only because I wanted to versus succumbing to the scare tactics of stats, graphs etc on the fertility viability of women after 35. I followed up when I was ready to move forward in 2018.Dr. Goldschlag is personable when you he sees you in person and is very patient. He is good about answering questions and taking his time with you. I have trusted him with our treatment and he has been compassionate about our set backs.Dr. Davis is up to date on all of the research and is a preeminent expert in the field.  I only saw him in person once because I live uptown and decided to do all my monitoring in Tribeca, but when I had questions it was very easy to schedule a call and he always took the time to speak with me and answer any of my questions. As a doctor myself, I've always treated patients the way I want to be treated and I feel threat Dr. Schattman does the same. He explained everything when doing ultrasounds and answered all questions I had, including when I could start my next round after my current pregnancy. My only complaint is that when it looked like one of my babies wasn't doing as well as the other, he said it could go either way when in his notes, he wrote ""likely resolution."" I think I would have preferred having been toldhe wasn't going to make it because I spent 2 weeks hoping he'd catch up with his sister, which he never did and was pretty gutted when I learned I'd miscarried. I know he is good at what he does.  However, I feel like there were several oversights in association with my treatment, and I wonder if his ego got in the way.  As an example, he waited several cycles before performing an HSG on me.  Most clinics use that in their initial diagnostic phase.  IUIs with a blocked fallopian tube is pointless.  AND an HSG can increase the chances of IUI success.  No reason in the world that this shouldn't have been done before I started.  Lots of money down the drain, and I consider that careless.Dr. Reichman is a conscientious, responsive, and caring, but he is conservative and didn't go above and beyond to help us get to the root of our problem.  We had 48 eggs retrieved over the course of two cycles, 34 of which were mature, only 1 fertilized with ICSI, and that embryo didn't survive long enough for transfer.  We felt he shrugged us off and was ready to let us move on without trying to dig in and search for answers, run additional tests, etc.  This was a let down.Dr. Goldschlag is very patient, always asks me  how I am doing, how I am feeling - he knows after our three year journey how my emotions can get the best of me and he always asks how things are at home. He talks to me in a way that I understand what is going on, but also that shows he respects my intelligence as a health care professional. 

Dr. Goldschlag also has a way of lightening the mood without coming off as uncaring or harsh. He jokes with me about my reliance on Dr. Google, and he always is up to date on all the studies and new tests I bring up and what is good about the studies or what was lacking in them and why he does or does not buy into the findings. I like that he is constantly researching and learning and not just doing the same thing over and over. No two of my protocols have ever been the same (until this current cycle bc the last cycle we did I got pregnant with my daughter and we are hoping to recreate that!!), he is always taking my latest hormone levels into account and tweaking everything so I react to the meds the best way possible. 

Also, he always gives my husband and I a few minutes after a monitoring appointment in the room to ask questions and talk about what is going on in order to make sure that we are comfortable with everything. It can be very hard to reach anyone in the office, and almost impossible to reach him on the phone, so I like that he gives us that time. 

Another thing he has started doing (I am not sure if this is for everyone, but my IVF cycles were not like this), is scheduling monitoring appointments with him specifically, so I am on his schedule and know when I am going to be seeing him so that I do not have to wait as long, and there is a continuity of care, as opposed to seeing which ever MD is on call that day for ultrasounds, and then it taking several days before I see him again and can get my questions answered. 

Dr. Goldschlag is also EXCELLENT when the cycle fails. We have had multiple cycles fail - very, very difficulty failures - and the way he handled it, my emotions, my husband's emotions, he was very straight forward and honest with us about our bleak situation and what the next steps were. I appreciated the honesty and when he was not being straightforward with me at one point I called him out on it and from then on he gave it to me like it was. I feel for myself and my husband, it is better for us to know the truth from the outset than for us to be under the assumption that we are going to have this amazing experience. 

Overall he was very willing to work with us and ultimately he was able to help us get to our goal and give us our beautiful daughter. Dr. Reichman is probably the best doctor I've ever had. He is not only extremely knowledgeable and skillful as a physician, but is also a highly effective communicator. He made sure I was fully informed at every step of the process and laid out pros and cons of every decision, including financial considerations (e.g. when deciding on next steps, he explained what he would recommend if money were no consideration and what he would recommend given the cost, and then left it up to me to decide what made the most sense for my situation).Dr. Spandorfer isn't the hand holding type but I appreciated his warm personality and light humor.  He was positive, empathetic and helped make a stressful and emotional process a bit easier.  He doesn't always explain next steps thoroughly but was always willing to answer questions or elaborate if I asked.  I would 100% recommend him if he had a different staff. He is always knowledgeable about my situation, answers my questions and seems to be on top of his game. Usually he calls me back immediately. Once i had been notified of a chemical pregnancy but he didn’t call me until Monday (i asked to speak to him Friday morning). Dr. Pfeifer was/is excellent. She was compassionate and caring and very knowledgeable--but still blunt enough so that you know to expect realistically. She keeps up-to-date with emerging studies surrounding IVF and doesn't just jump on the bandwagon of extras unless she truly thinks they could help. I love that she takes your thoughts and opinions and concerns but at the end of the day she is the doctor and I can trust her to make the best decisions for my protocols. Dr. Goldschlag  is very mild mannered, soft spoken, and always asks how I'm doing.   I am 40, and have been trying to conceive for 1 year. He did not jump to ivf, he first  made sure my body is in the best condition it can be to to conceive before proceeding with further fertility treatment.  Since I have hypothyroid, he had to make sure it is at optimal level.  He has also surgical removed a polyp in my uterus,  which has been blocking egg implantation.  It is something my regular obgyn failed to inform me about.  I have now done 1 round of IUI, but has failed.  I will continue 2 more rounds of IUI before moving onto to IVF.  

He does seem to have a full schedule so appointments can be quick.  I sometimes have to rely on his assistant to explain the next steps. Dr.Reichman is friendly, easy to talk to and caring, but also very to the point, which is so important to me. He doesn't beat around the bush and explains every possible outcome in detail, which is so important throughout this process. He is also sarcastic and cracks jokes - SO needed with all the stress infertility brings.  Dr. Reichman performed a thorough work up of both me and my husband. He explained the tests. He was very friendly and we looked forward to our visits. On the occasions that I was particularly hormonal/emotional/struggling with what felt like a long period of treatment he was not overly supportive. I felt he was more comfortable at appointments if my husband was present. As part of treatment there are a lot of transactional ultrasounds and I found that he (as well as other male doctors) are less gentle than my subsequent experience of female doctors. That said, I fully trusted Dr. Reichman to get us the result we wanted - without question - and therefore was fine with the minor discomfort.Dr Elias is extremely intelligent and knows his stuff.  Among other tests, he did a HSG and felt one of my tubes was questionable and told me I would need a lap.  However, when the radiologist read the images, the radiologist read them as normal. Dr Elias then said we should hold off on the lap and try some clomid cycles, some with IUI.  They didn’t work and finally I told him I wanted the lap and to move to ivf which he agreed to readily. Turned out my left tube was completely blocked, Black, twisted, a total mess and had to be removed.  I wish Dr Elias had been more aggressive and gone with his gut feeling after the HSG that the tube was not right and recommended a lap from the beginning (which I would have been fine with) - especially since previous to developing the tube issue developing, I’d always gotten pregnant on the first month of trying (although many ended in miscarriage). I wasted 7 months and a large chunk of my insurance money on IUIs and clomid cycles that were never going to work with that tube. At the age of 42, the wasted 7 months was the hardest to swallow. Shortly after tube surgery, i had a failed ivf cycle, but then got pregnant naturally 2 months later.  With that said, Dr Elias knows his stuff and is a kind and caring doctor - wish he’d been more aggressive particularly with my age.Dr. Reichman was, in short, a dream to find, in a city full of top REs.  From the moment we sat down in our consultation, it became clear that he was not only an excellently trained physician, but was also passionate about his specialty, and sincerely empathetic towards his patients.  This combination allowed me to truly relax and leave myself in his hands (e.g., no more endless googling!), in a way I never really did with my first doctor, and I think that made a difference in our outcome, if only by improving my mental wellbeing as we went through our cycle.  We saw him at every single monitoring appointment, and when questions arose, I emailed him directly, and heard back without fail in a few hours or less.  From what I understand from friends, these are unique qualities to find in a doctor at the top clinics in NYC, given the huge numbers of patients they churn out.  In short, even before our first (and only) cycle was finished, my husband and I were thrilled with the level of care we received from Dr. Reichman.Dr. Reichman is very knowledgeable and caring.  He made sure he understood my husband and my concerns, outlined all the options, and guided us to choosing a strategy that best suited our needs.  He is very on top of the latest developments in this field of medicine.  I also liked that I saw him on each visit.  He kept me informed and made the process as smooth as possible.Dr. Reichman is the most extraordinary doctor and human being we have ever met. In a difficult journey of Infertility, you cannot find someone better than Dr. Reichman to be on your side. We wish we knew about him when we started this journey three years back. Right from the first time we met Dr. Reichman, he came across as a good and caring human being himself. He had our best interest in mind and devised a treatment plan to help achieve our goals. He has always been kind, compassionate and extremely well read which gives one tremendous confidence in his abilities. Compared to our experiences with other top doctors and fertility clinics in New York, Dr. Reichman has set a benchmark of care, treatment, knowledge, compassion and effectiveness which in our opinion is hard to beat. He is always two steps ahead in the treatment plan. He is very efficient and always gave us ample time during each visit. Our appointments were always on time and he was fully aware of our current and past medical data to make the most accurate decision on treatment plan. We highly recommend Dr. Reichman.Dr. Reichman is a very smart, experienced, and trustworthy RE.  He was always exact in his findings and explained things in a way that a non-medical professional can understand.  He also has a wonderful bedside manner.I've been seeing Dr. Reichman for almost a year now.  We did multiple rounds of 
Clomid and Letrozole, 2 egg retrievals and 1 embryo transfer.  I am currently 12 weeks pregnant with my first child all thanks to Dr. Reichman! 
After trying Clomid and Letrozole for a few months, I was eager to begin IVF.   I would like to point out that Dr Reichman did regard me as one of his more challenging IVF patients.  I'm very petite with PCOS and a very high AMH so I had to be carefully monitored while stimming to avoid OHSS.  I saw Dr. Reichman every day for nearly 2 weeks and he was very good about explaining what the different levels from blood tests meant and his strategy for setting the dosage of meds each night, even during the holidays.  As all readers will be aware, this process is very involved and quite intense, and I definitely felt that Dr. Reichman was with me all of the way.  I was 35 at the time of my first retrieval and I have to say I thought we would be done after a single egg retrieval since my AMH was so high.  We were disappointed when the numbers quickly dwindled from eggs retrieved, to mature eggs, then fertilized, to the ones that made it to day 5. We were only able to get 1 PGS normal embryo from the 18 retrieved eggs. I knew Dr. Reichman was disappointed as well.  He outlined what we might try differently if we chose to do another retrieval and was always optimistic he could give us the family we wanted.  Not that I had any reason to doubt Dr Reichman, but more because of the time and money involved, I sought a second opinion. I met with another renowned clinic and the doctor there actually said my protocol was excellent and that she would not have done anything differently to Dr. Reichman. That doctor also said Weill Cornell is an excellent fertility center.  That was very reassuring and we decided to do another retrieval with Dr. Reichman.  I began Metformin (even though I don't have diabetes, some say it helps with egg quality in PCOS women), weekly acupuncture, and drastically changed my diet.  I waited 4 months in between egg retrievals since it takes 90 days to recruit a primordial follicle.  The second retrieval resulted in 2 euploid and 2 mosaic embryos.  With 5 total frozen embryos, we decided to try a frozen embryo transfer. 
I am currently 12 weeks pregnant and looking forward to seeing Dr. Reichman for the next FET. The ART process is very complicated and there were so many things I had questions about.  Dr. Reichman patiently helped me weigh the pros and cons of each decision and he went out of his way to treat me and put my mind at ease.  We are very grateful to him.
Dr. Pfiefer is compassionate and a good communicator and she’s made adjustments to my protocols to improve my cycles. My obgyn recommended that I see Dr. Reichman or Dr. Pfeiffer for IVF. Dr. Reichman had better reviews but his assistant never called me back, so I ended up seeing Dr. Pfeifer. At 40 years old, my AMH was 2.29 and my FSH was 7.18, so we thought it would be ok to start with 3 IUI. My first two IUIs were unsuccessful. Dr. Pfeifer then found a small fibroid which she removed surgically. I thought this might be preventing me from getting pregnant so we tried 2 more IUIs which were unsuccessful before moving on to IVF. I’ve done 3 ivf cycles using the antagonist protocol, with adjustments and significant improvement with each cycle. For IVF#1, I had 5 follicles and 7 eggs retrieved, 7 mature, 5 fertilized, but there was fragmentation with most of the embryos. For IVF#2 (four months after IVF#1), I had 9 follicles and 7 eggs retrieved, 5 mature, 4 fertilized but the quality was much better – no fragmentation. For IVF#3 (seven months after IVF#1), I had 9 follicles and 16 eggs were retrieved, 13 mature, 12 fertilized and 6 made it to blastocyst. Two were transferred on day 5. Four were PGS tested: 2 normal and 1 mosaic. So far I have had a favorable experience with Dr. Pfeifer. At some point, I asked Dr. Pfeifer if DHEA supplementation could help and she was neutral on it, she said the research isn’t conclusive but it if I wanted to it wouldn’t hurt. I ended up doing my own research and taking DHEA as well as other supplements and my cycles have improved the longer I have been taking the supplements, although I'm not sure if it is the DHEA or something else. I am personally doing a lot to try to improve egg quality, as far as diet, exercise, supplements, acupuncture, yoga, meditation and herbs and educating myself about avoiding fertility harming toxins, and having emotional support of close friends (who have gone through IVF) and family. My second and third cycles were also a lot easier for me mentally since I had been through it before and knew what to expect and was much more adept at administering the medication.Dr. Goldschlag is a very kind doctor. He is very quiet when he talks. That quietness and calmness definitely puts you at ease a bit, but with all of the machines running, it can be difficult to hear him at times. He doesn't explain much or provide you with much information other than, ""You'll hear from a nurse later with instructions."" If you have questions, he will answer them and give you the time you deserve, but sometimes on the spot it can be overwhelming and you're not necessarily sure what your questions are. I wish he was more thorough when in the room, so that questions didn't arise when you left because getting in contact with a nurse, or him,  is difficult. You always get a machine. He is so positive that it really causes you to become just as positive as well. Its not ""if you get pregnant"", he says ""when you get pregnant"". He is very calm and very honest. You can really tell and feel that he wants to hear what is on your mind and how you are coping. He takes the time to explain every thing about the process to you and calls back his patients. No matter how big the matter, he wants you to feel that you can reach out to him no matter what. The only negative is that he isn't overly friendly with his patients. Your relationship with him is strictly about your goal, with minimal small talk. He shows his sympathy as best he could and you can tell he is trying but he would not be described as a warm doctor.Dr. Pfeifer has a very direct approach to explaining things with good bedside manners.  There were times where I felt she could do better in explaining the whole picture or long term impact of my treatments.  For example, when she mentioned harvesting more eggs sooner rather than later, I didn't realize the long term impact and timing of all the IVF cyclesDr. Schattman, while very busy, was always responsive when we reached out to him--and had a very concrete plan in place for me within 20 minutes of us meeting. He tailored my protocol to me, instead of just doing the same thing he does with every patient, which I appreciated. Dr Reichman is always reachable via email which is great. He will answer you within 24-48 hours. He is compassionate and understanding. His approach to treatment is very straightforward and he explains everything step by step. He is a wonderful doctor Dr. Pfeifer was kind in how she explained my results and what we'd try next. After a few losses when trying naturally she seemed to be in my corner and wanted to see me pregnant. She didn't perform my IUI but saw me for my ultrasounds (except for weekend monitoring.)He's so bright, thoughtful and experienced and is able to operate with appropriate levels of empathy and compassion.  
He's busy and a fast talker but was very patient with all of the questions and details I wanted.  I wish I had seen him more generally but I felt he was extremely accessible over the phone.  There were a few instances where he went out of his way to check my follicles during the retrieval processes.  He was hands on when he felt like he needed first hand evaluation to ensure we were setting ourselves up for success. We had a fantastic experience with Dr. Melnick.  She always took her time to answer our many questions and explained every step of our treatment plan thoroughly.  She returned our calls and emails promptly and we saw her for nearly every monitoring appointment and procedure. While fertility treatments can be extremely overwhelming, Dr. Melnick went above and beyond to make our experience as smooth as possible. She is a true expert in her field and we are eternally thankful for her care.Strengths: Direct, intelligent, not patronizing, showed empathy, competent. He will call you on a weekend or late in the evening to check in on you. I've never had doctors call me outside of business hours before so this was appreciated (meaning did not feel like a 9-5 operation).

Weakness: Can be rushed. Appointments never started on time (sometimes had to wait 1.5-2 hrs in waiting room). Did not seem overly involved in my case for some rounds of IVF but granted we had gone through 8 egg retrievals together so near the end, I felt I was in good hands with any doctor at the clinic.I would highly recommend Dr Reichman to anyone! He was the second doctor we worked with and our experience with him was way better than with our Utah doctor. When we moved to NYC I met with another doctor at RMA and left in tears after that consultation. Two months later I met with Dr Reichman and knew he was a good doctor and cared about his patients on a personal level. He listens to you as a patient, and offers his expertise in a straight forward but kind way. Our insurance does not cover infertility and he was great about keeping that mind while treating us. We had 2 failed embryo transfers with our previous doctor (4 embryos total) and with Dr Reichman we transferred 1 embryo on day 3 and I am currently 30 weeks pregnant! He did the cycle completely different and I wish I went to him first! I can't say enough good things about him! Dr. Pfeifer was always very positive and encouraging in regards to treatments, medications, etc. The clinic was always very busy, so her time during morning monitoring appointments was rather limited, so those appointments were quick and to the point. When an issue did arise with one of her nurses, she was nice enough to offer that we should contact her directly.  From our first session with Dr. Reichman it was clear that he not only has a great deal of compassion for his patients but also for his profession. He nicely explained our treatment options and the steps that would be taken once we decided on what option was best for us. Dr. Reichman answered all of our questions and never made use feel as though we should be embarrassed to ask such questions. Follow up calls were always made in a timely manner and Dr. Reichamn always made me feel at ease with each appointment. He most certainly helped lessen the stress that coincides with infertility. 
I knew Dr. Reichman was the doctor I had been looking for immediately after our first visit. His office is neat and clean and bright. He is young and obviously extremely intelligent and progressive in his field. He has a very strong understanding of fertility issues and is able to easily educate you on them. He is compassionate and caring, while at the same time honest and direct. Dr. Elias was responsible for our first miracle and we are currently trying for our second miracle.  We first went to him in 2016 after failing to get pregnant and after miscarriage.  After various testing we had unexplained infertility and he recommended a cycle being monitored on clomid with timed intercourse based on ultrasound monitoring which we did and did not work.  That was followed by clomid cycles for IUI which did not work either and although Dr Elias recommended one more IUI we opted for IVF as our insurance didn’t cover either so we opted for more of a sure thing.  We were pregnant with our son after 1 IVF cycle using fresh embryos.  Unfortunately we did not have any left to freeze but we were over the moon with our little boy.He addressed what we needed to do to get pregnant which is exactly what I wanted to hear. He knew what would be the best course and i trusted him immensely. We chose the path set out for us and i could not be happier. I plan to return to Dr. For our two frozen embryos that made it to blastocyst. In a season of life where things are uncertain and feel like a rollercoaster, Dr. Reichman was consistent, sympathetic, caring, and helpful. He was always thorough, present, and was interested in doing what we felt was best. He would provide suggestions/options for care, give his opinion, and then would tell me to talk with my husband and figure out what we felt was best for us. Obviously if there were really serious situations where there were no options this did not happen, but I was grateful for the fact that it was never ""his way or the highway"", so to speak. He listened and he cared. Dr. Reichman celebrated with us when we had triumphs and was caring and compassionate when we got bad news. I remember being so surprised when I received a call from him after miscarrying. He showed genuine concern for my well-being and the well-being of my husband. Though not a long conversation, the fact that he even took the time to call was so thoughtful. He was always present at appointments (meaning mentally), checked to make sure I was doing okay, made sure all my questions were answered, and went the extra mile to make sure things were seamless. Though monitoring was crazy and he saw probably close to 50 or more patients each morning, he was focused on my care and made my husband and I feel like we were his only patients. Basically, at the end of the day, I would recommend him to anyone and everyone. Not only is he a brilliant doctor, but a kind and caring individual. Dr. David Reichman is the best doctor I ever had, very knowledgeable and skilled. I got success in my first IUI with him. The whole process seemed so much easier than I expected - he was very accommodating of my schedule, on my first visit itself he proactively collected my medical history and always contextualized our conversation in light of every detail I mentioned over email or in person, no extra medicines, no extra blood tests, it was all so perfectly timed that things worked out the first time itself! I can't be more thankful to him. Strengths — answers emails extremely quickly. Objectively assessed my results even when he wasn’t on call — another physician personally mentioned that he called for more information about my ultrasound during morning monitoring one weekend. 
Weaknesses — clinic can be disorganized and doctors can fall victim to nurses basically trying to apply protocols that don’t always fit — they can’t catch every issue on every patient and still be a functional member of society. She is very knowledgeable about her field.  
She is pleasant and takes her time to speak with you especially when you might feel emotional and stress about the process.
Even when you do not get to speak with her directly, her staff always call back.
I have gone to another provider for fertility treatment and my experience with her makes me want to complete this treatment.  I a m having a very good experience.Doctor Davis was always available to answer questions either by phone or email. He adjusted course of treatment multiple times when I didn’t respond well to stimulation. I have done 3 cycles with drDavis and am still in process of banking embryos for transfer. First transfer didn’t work out but I am still hopeful. Dr. Pfeifer gave me every confidence that she was dialed in to what I needed for my personal treatment success and I'm very glad I chose her to guide me through this process.  I would definitely recommend her to anyone looking to have a great working relationship with their doctor and be treated as an individual, even within a very large practice.Pros
Dr. Davis was generous with his time. After we became his patient, we could schedule a visit with him within a week of when we called for an appointment he also followed up all phone calls to his office and provided time on the phone to answer my questions. Even though Cornell is a group practice, it was obvious that Dr. Davis was making the decisions about the day to day changes in my cycles. He adjusted his schedule so he was the physician who completed the retrieval for both of my cycles with him.  While I have not been successful with him and we are moving on to donor eggs, I had the best experience with cycles with him. 

 I felt like an individual patient with him rather than just someone who the standard  protocol was not working for them. He was very engaged with adjusting the cycle. We did day 3 transfer, which was not offered by our prior RE, we also tried a co-cultured cycle with him. He was always very truthful in his expectations of success and we never felt like he was trying to sell us or convince of a procedure that he did not believe would potentially improve the cycle.
Cons
Dr. Davis speaks very quickly. He also tended to be quite technical but that may be because he was aware of my back ground in genetics and health care. He spoke more often to me rather than my husband though my husband was present at all appointments with him. Very good doctor best fertility doctor compared to the tons of unqualified doctors my friends have seen. He leaves no stone unturned and gives you real advice (stop working out all the time, drink less alcohol). He’s to the point but gets the job done. He has a great memory and remembers your specific case. I am very lucky to have been referred to him by my obgyn and has success. 

Dr Rosenwaks is not warm or bubbly, but he is a GENIUS. He knows the science and art of fertility. I did always feel like I was in the absolute best of hands. I never doubted, IF he would successfully get me pregnant, it was just a matter of time. He definitely is not forthcoming when it comes to providing information and a treatment plan, he only provides bits and pieces as time goes along, I think that is the case because he really studies you as a patient and makes decisions as things progress and he makes adjustments accordingly. I would definitely be going back for future pregnancy help.I cannot say enough positive things about Dr. Reichman!  He is right up there with the very best reproductive specialists in his field i.e., Dr. Schoolcraft at Colorado.  I saw him after trying to conceive for 3 years, seeing other specialists and suffering two miscarriages.  Dr. Reichman took a very close look at why I was miscarrying and noticed two separate issues that other doctors had missed.  He fixed both problems so that when we decided to do IVF, I had the best chances of it working.  Dr. Reichman has an excellent bedside manner, but even more than that, he is extremely knowledgeable and precise.  He is responsive and will make time to answer all of your questions.  Dr. Reichman helped me successfully conceive on the first try with IVF. I know I would not have a baby boy today had I not met Dr. Reichman when I did. I don't normally write reviews but want other woman in search of an amazing doctor to know really great help does exist.  He was very impressive.  He had ideas on how to take a different approach after we had four previously failed cycles.  He couldn’t really explain to us why our transfer didn’t work.  When I wanted to know what we could do differently for a subsequent cycle, I never heard back from him. I felt like Dr. Spandorfer didn't really explain what was the next step. It was like, here is the Clomid, the nurse will explain when to take it, and then come back next week. At the next appointment it was like ok you are ready for the IUI, come back tomorrow with your husband. It felt so overwhelming and confusing. I had never taking fertility drugs before, so I had no idea what the steps were. By the third IUI, I finally understood the process, but it was very hard to figure out initially. It was almost like he expected me to have done my research.Dr. Goldschlag is a caring, compassionate doctor though I ultimately found him overly optimistic in my particular case.  I also would have liked more information along the way without a lot of prodding/questioning, he's largely a man of few words.  My biggest disappointment/frustration was a lack of communication which I suspect was due to balancing a large practice, both when there was good news (surprise natural pregnancy) followed by the need to request a call when there was bad news (chemical pregnancy), which ultimately was the impetus for me leaving Weill Cornell/CRM.My husband and I both really liked Dr. Davis. Easy to talk to, compassionate, direct with the stats but always optimistic, never made us feel rushed and took his time answering our questions always with thoughtful and detailed responses.Dr. Kligman is very knowledgeable.  When in person, he communicates decently and is patient when answering questions.  However, the communication and decisions don't seem to be two-way.  After my first failed IUI, I asked to start IVF next given my age and for family planning purposes.  However, he dismissed my request and made me do another IUI which failed again, meaning a few months slipped by before I started my first IVF cycle.  Dr Schattman was great and really has a strong grasp of all different scenarios related to IUI/IVF.  My husband would constantly ask questions regarding percentage chances of X and he would know the answer.  He is very straightforward which I appreciated and he made us feel that he was there when we needed him - from being available for calls to making an effort to do our transfers when it wasnt his scheduled day in the hospital.  It is not a easy situation to go through but Dr Schattman's guidance made it as bearable as can be.Dr. Reichman is smart, skilled and just plain great at what he does. He’s extremely compassionate and caring. When my first 2 transfers didn’t take (with other doctors that were scheduled on those days), Dr. Reichman made sure to perform my third transfer himself, and now I have a wonderful baby boy as a result. 

Dr. Reichman never hesitates to level with you (always with compassion) about what’s going on and what you’re expectations should be. I loved that about him, but you must be prepared to potentially face hard truths. 

One last thing... Dr. Reichman is incredibly responsive by email, which is wonderful considering the number of questions that can come up as part of the process.I stuck with Dr. Goldschlag through 6 IUIs and 5 IVFs over the course of the past 4 years because I genuinely believe in and trust him. He is kind, compassionate and understanding of the setbacks that go along with this process. When I miscarried in the office, he was there to hold my hand, reassure me and just be a support system...sitting in the room with me for a good hour to personally handle my case and make sure I was OK/had someone who could come to get me.

He is also a bit more cautious, which I personally preferred...slow, steady and ultimately successful. I was blessed to deliver my daughter in 2013 and am now pregnant with #2 - to which I owe Dr. G all the credit in the world. 

The one red flag for me was the fact that neither he nor his nursing staff ever identified my weight as an obstacle. My weight, at one point, dropped dangerously low and was never once flagged as an issue/nor was it ever mentioned that I should be seeking help before continuing to cycle.

WARRIOR REVIEWI came to Dr. Reichman after having been diagnosed with Asherman's Syndrome (intrauterine scarring resulting from a D&C and/or c-section) for the second time, resulting in thin uterine lining and fluid in the lining. I had just done two FETs that were unsuccessful and wasn't sure what to do next since my embryos were in DC and I was living in NYC and felt like maybe I needed more extensive treatments and didn't want to travel to DC for them. Dr. Reichman was great about taking over my case and helping me feel like I wasn't alone in my struggles. He determined that I needed to have another hysteroscopy because the shape of my uterus was still abnormal and he thought that another hysteroscopy might fix the thinness issue and fluid issue (I had already had 4 hysteroscopies at this point - complicated story). I was hopeful that removing any remaining scarring would solve the issues. Another doctor I had seen for 3 of the previous hysteroscopies didn't think that removing additional scarring would help. He thought the uterus was good enough as is structurally but that I was now having a functional issue with my response to estrogen. I was willing to go with Dr. Reichman's plan since I had just had 2 unsuccessful FETs after working on the functional issue with estrogen therapy and wanted to try something new. Dr. Reichman did my 5th hysteroscopy. It did not go as planned. Dr. Reichman said my uterus was completely scarred shut, he didn't cut away any scars because it was too risky, and he couldn't place even a pediatric balloon in there. I was so so upset about this result. I mean I knew I had some scarring on the left side but I didn't think it was that severe - had I really just done 2 FETs of good embryos to a uterus that was completely scarred shut? We decided to do a 6th hysteroscopy with Dr. Reichman and his colleague Dr. Schattman one month later. I think Dr. Reichman liked the plan of collaborating with Dr. Schattman since he wanted what he was seeing to be confirmed by a colleague. This hysteroscopy went well - the big scar on the left that we knew about was removed and a balloon was placed. The second procedure at Cornell was successful in that my uterus appeared to be a normal shape one month later on saline ultrasound. However, after taking letrozole for a month and then clomid the following month to see what my lining would look like at ovulation time (a mock natural cycle), it was determined that there was nothing left to do about my thin uterine lining and fluid issues. If my lining had looked good either of those cycles, we would have scheduled another FET. Because it didn't look good (4mm-ish plus fluid), my husband and I had sex around ovulation (no pregnancy resulting). I think Dr. Reichman didn't actually go into my uterus during that first hysteroscopy; I think he went into the muscle under my uterus (something called a ""false passage""). I brought this up after the first hysteroscopy with him and he didn't think that was what happened. And we didn't really talk about it after the second hysteroscopy. I think we were both just really hopeful that the second hysteroscopy would fix my problems. Oh my goodness. Doctors are really just people and hysteroscopies are mysteries. All I know is that I was counseled to pursue a gestational carrier during those dark days after the first hysteroscopy and that was actually a good thing because I started the process of coming to terms with my uterus really not being something that I can fix. Wish we'd had better results, but I think I've tried the functional issue approach and I've tried the structural issue approach and neither seems to have worked so I am moving on. In summary, I didn't get the results I wanted, but I still think Dr. Reichman is a good doctor and a good person too.I saw Dr. Schattman based on a friend's recommendation. I had had a bad experience with a previous clinic in that I never was able to get a clear answer about what my tests indicated about my prognosis, unfortunately trusting that they had my best interest in mind. I had a consultation with Dr. Schattman, who looked over my medical records, ordered bloodwork and did an HSG the same week. He clearly and promptly explained the results and his advie about how to proceed with achieving pregnancy. I appreciated how quick and clear he was. In less than a week I had all the information I needed to make an informed decision that put my mind at ease, unlike the previous clinic that strung me along (taking thousands of dollars for worthless procedures). Dr. Schattman will have your best interest in mind.Dr. Elias diagnosed me very easily with the HSG test and found a hydrosalpinx in my right fallopian tube (where I had my ovary removed 15 years ago). He did the surgery to remove that tube and ended up removing the left tube as well, as it was also diseased and he did not want it to cause another miscarriage (I had one a year ago, likely due to the blocked tube). He did an excellent job on my surgery - I had laparoscopic surgery years ago to remove my ovary due to a dermoid cyst, and my recovery was MUCH worse then. I had very little pain and healed quickly after the surgery. We started IVF the next month. Dr. Elias did my retrieval even though he wasn't scheduled to do so (he was on call in the office) which I really appreciated. There was a possibility I was going to need to have a trans-abdominal retrieval and he wanted to be the one to do it. Thankfully, that did not happen and I ended up having 8 eggs, which was much higher than either of us expected. We had also expected to need to do a day 3 transfer, but we were able to do a day 5 transfer of a fresh embryo and then freeze the remaining 3. Unfortunately, the transfer was not successful. We plan on trying a frozen transfer with the remaining embryos and are hopeful we will have success in the coming months. I really like Dr. Elias - I find him to be very statistics focused, and he is well-read about all of the current research. My only complaint is that sometimes I find him a bit hard to understand as he has a bit of an accent and speaks quickly. However, that has not impacted my care in any way. I highly recommend him!I had a great overall experience with Dr. Spandorfer. When my husband and I showed up at his office with an unexpected severe MFI diagnosis, we were in a bit of shock and did not know what to expect. He was kind and empathetic, but did not spend much time on exploring why or how this issue came about. Had we been hoping to attempt to fix the problem naturally (or get satisfying answers) before moving on to ART, this might have been a problem for us. But we were looking for the fastest and most efficient route to a baby and Dr. Spandorfer ( very appropriately and capably) focused his attention his areas of expertise and helping us move forward quickly. While our interaction with Dr. Spandorfer during our fresh cycle was fairly limited (due to Cornell's pooled monitoring/procedure method), I felt like he was reachable if I had any questions and knew that he was the one reviewing my file daily and making the important calls. When our first cycle was successful but ended in a miscarriage, Dr. Spandorfer showed much more compassion than I expected for a doctor at a high volume fertility clinic (and more than I had gotten from any of my regular obgyns in the past) and became our single point of contact for all future appointments and procedures. While it is true that he is very efficient and aware of keeping to a schedule, this benefits his patients and I never found him unwilling to spend time if i had questions or engage in friendly conversation. Rapport with him was so easy that I actually found it hard to transition back to a regular ob after our successful frozen transfer. I was referred to Dr. Kang by my regular OB whom I trust completely. When I first met Dr. Kang, I felt she was confident with her abilities to address my issues and I had no reason no to trust her. She first gauged my expectations, and I was okay with a more moderate approach (starting with Clomid and TI before moving to Clomid + IUIs, then injectables + IUIs, and finally IVF), since we weren't sure what exactly was keeping me from getting pregnant. Each cycle was adjusted to see how my body would respond. In the end, we found that I respond better to lower dosages of meds than higher ones. I think that Dr. Kang made the correct calls regarding my protocol.Dr. Kligman was recommended to me by a friend. He is very professional and kind. I trusted his treatment plan. He preformed my first ER and my ET. At Cornell you will not see your doctor regularly and the nursing staff is your primary contact. Dr. Kligman called me when I had to postpone a cycle due to results from a Pre- cycle test which I greatly appreciated. Initially I came to Dr. Pfeifer after a referral from Dr. Peter Schlegel during treatment for male infertility. I was an out-of-town patient which made communication and remote testing complicated at times. That said, Dr. Pfeifer had at one point provided me her cell number and has since allowed me to text her- though I try to respect her privacy and do so sparingly. I did, however, find this to be especially helpful at times when I needed something urgent, or in the event I was unable to get through to her via e-mail or get through to one of the nurses or on-call physicians (weekends, nights, etc.) The shear fact that she trusted me with giving me her cell number shows how much she cared for me as her patient.  We had success after a frozen blastocyst transfer in June of this year, after a failed fresh 3-day transfer in March (2nd IVF cycle), and failed TESE/initial IVF cycle with a frozen embryo transfer. Dr. Pfeifer is always very approachable with questions, but at times, it seems she struggles to keep up with her large patient load as it can take multiple attempts to get a hold of her. That said, she is always more than willing to help and listen when you do! It requires a lot of patience and persistence, but worth it when you do get through to her.I was very happy to have chosen Dr. Spandorfer and Weill Cornell after having negative experiences at another clinic. I felt like Dr. Spandorfer was readily available to speak on the phone if needed and I saw him during most of my visits. He loves to tell corny jokes - but this doesn't bother me. Infertility is so depressing, that it was kind of nice to have the mood lightened.I am still going through the process so I can't detail my experience in full but everything so far has been positive. He is efficient in his testing procedures and had requested a lot of different tests than my previous clinic. This made me feel more confident in his skills than my previous doctor. He is also prescribing a different method of treatment for my next cycle which makes me feel like he is more thoughtful in his approach rather than just out to get our money by suggesting the most expensive option.He simply should not be treating for infertility.  I've lived in NYC my entire life and have never encountered someone with less bedside manner.  Unacceptable, rude, unprofessional, and generally seems like he should probably retire.We're still in treatment so can't really fully answer til done. Despite 4 miscarriages in one year we've not considered switching doctors so that should say something that we still trust him. He seems like a top doctor, an expert - and a human being - which is the ideal combination in this profession I think. He won't do unnecessary interventions so if he says x is worth the $ it probably is and if not he'll tell you.Dr. Elias is very good about laying things out and having very candid conversations. He has always had a calming effect on me even when he's delivering bad news. He gives me as much time as I need to ask my questions. I never feel like he's rushing me out the door.So far my experiences have been very positive. Dr. Pfeifer takes the time to answer the questions I have and comes across as caring and thoughtful. She strikes a good balance of being honest and nurturing.I was at another clinic in NYC where I had a negative experience with the dr rushing us through clomid cycles and overstimulating me on Follistim before even trying Clomid.  We left that clinic after a referral from a colleague to try Cornell.  I picked Dr Elias because he had experience with septate uteruses, which is what I had had.  He was immediately responsive and after 2-3 cycles with him I was pregnant.  He started slowly and really paid attention.  After my first child turned 1, we went back to him to try for another baby.  I had 6 iuis (Clomid cycles) last year.  I was pregnant on the third one but miscarried and then again on the sixth but it was ectopic.  So in terms of helping me get pregnant, I am happy with Dr. Elias.  I don't know that there was anything else he could have done to avoid the pregnancy losses.  Sometimes I did feel that he didn't grasp how awful the pregnancy loss was for us - the devastation we felt - or maybe he does but doesn't get into the emotions.  Hard to say.  He did spend a decent amount of time with us with both losses explaining options and future options.  One thing also to note is that when we started seeing him he was more available and less rushed.  Now he seems to have a much larger caseload. She is very nice and empathetic. I liked her as a person. I trusted her judgement. Something about her bedside manner is odd and/or misleading. And I was unclear as to how involved in my cycle she was as there were no changes and no conversations unless I requested. Her predictions were mostly right, but I felt like I was fighting a losing battle, and that she felt the same way. I trust him.  He always exudes confidence in his approach and a gentle optimism that is so important during this stressful time.  During the good news, he was as excited as we were... and during the bad news, we felt as though he was in it with us as well. I feel lucky to have him as my doctor and know he wants the same outcome we do. Dr Davis is extremely knowledgeable and knew my chart and history inside and out before our consults. He is willing to try numerous treatment options and does not get discouraged by poor responders. Dr. Davis is extremely busy and prefers phone calls to emails. If you have questions, leave a message with his assistants, and he will call back quickly. Dr. Kligman has been my doctor since 2013 at which time we did our first IVF cycle and I became pregnant with our first child.  I resumed seeing him in 2016 and we are working on number two.  Dr. Kligman is the ultimate professional.  He is smart, well-versed, courteous and caring.  He is always responsive to my concerns and questions and provides straightforward and honest answers (he is not one to sugar coat).  In between cycles, I had a natural pregnancy that ended in miscarriage.  He insisted on caring for me the whole way through, was completely supportive through a difficult time and even insisted on doing my D&C himself so that he could be comfortable that I would not have any delays when I was ready to try again.  He makes recommendations, and feels strongly about them, but will also let you give input on your preferred course of treatment and supports alternative courses of action.  We are having a tough time with number two and this is when your care gets put to the test but thus far I have not lost any confidence in him as my doctor.  I think Cornell as a practice can be somewhat rigid in approach and I see this from time to time in the way Kligman practices but ultimately he won't stick with something that isn't working.  I always feel in good hands. If you like a very kind and warm doctor, I would not recommend Dr. Goldschlag. He is very polite and will explain everything fully, however, he does not engage in extensive conversation.  I really appreciate that he answers every question thoroughly but gets to the point quickly, without small talk. Dr. Davis is highly competent, intelligent, compassionate, realistic, and thorough -- all the things I could have hoped for in a doctor. He is a man on a fertility mission; he is all business yet still manages to make you feel like a person. Despite the high volume of patients he sees on a daily basis, he was always up to speed with my treatment and was available whenever I needed to speak with him directly. At no time was I confused about my treatment or what the next steps were going to be. I can't recommend him highly enough.I 100% attribute Zev to the birth of my daughter. He is not a doctor who will hold your hand or be your best friend. He is all business, all the time. A very serious guy. But thats what I wanted. Didnt care about bedside mannor or a nice doctor. I wanted to have a baby and he made that happen. But have a thick skin going to him. Also, he does not call back for most questions. And doesnt call back same day. He is really only going to pay attention when you are doing a cylce with him. The rest of the time expect to communicate with nurses. Dr. Pfeifer was easy to work with and clear in her communications. I wouldn't say she is the most compassionate doctor - but I don't think you can expect that from most fertility clinics. She answered questions directly when I had the chance to ask them. The day of my egg retrieval even though she was not the doctor in the OR she called me to check in and let me know things had gone well. When I didn't answer the phone (napping) she took the time to call my husband which I really appreciated. Dr. Goldschlag was very calm and collected during the whole process which is an nice trait to have since at time I was a basket case. He would check in on my emotional state as well as my physical. He always returned phone calls within 24 hours if I asked to speak with him directly and he never made me feel rushed on the phone. He also understood that finances played a part in our decisions and helped us decide to not waste any more money on IUIs since we have no insurance coverage our money was better spent on IVF. When I was having a hard time with the nurses he put me in touch with a head nurse to oversee my case which made me feel like he heard my complaint and really tried to fix the situation. Over great guy.  Dr. Kang is very warm and does take the time to answer my questions when I have them. My appointments are usually very short since they are mostly monitoring and there are always a lot of people so it is easy to feel rushed. I had a few HSGs with her, which were painful for me and she was always very understanding and encouraging. She was also able to spend more time with me when I had an appointment as opposed to the monitoring visits.

I do wish I had more time to spend with Dr. Kang, but she did encourage me with my personal situation from the get-go.He seemed very optimistic about our case and about the prospect of getting pregnant, which I can't say for every doctor I've seen and I do think it makes a huge difference in my general confidence about the situation. He does not sugar coat anything, and he's not a hand-holder. That said, any time I've had questions or concerns, I've left him a voicemail and he's called me back immediately and walked me through the options and my worries. He never rushes me on the phone. In person, I do feel rushed with him and at times, like a number. But as long as I have my questions lined up, he will answer anything in person and is very helpful. We've yet to have a positive outcome (full term pregnancy) so I can't speak to his effectiveness just yet.Dr. Pfeifer is very personable and knowledgeable, and is also a straight talker. She's also funny and warm, and made me feel like a person, not a number. However, it's difficult to get ahold of her on the phone, which can be frustrating.Dr. Pfeifer established a plan for my treatment and explained it well. She was realistic yet encouraging. When my body responded in unexpected ways and we had to change the plan, she clearly communicated why. I trust her very much. Dr Davis was very knowledgeable.  He was upfront and honest about what my chances were of achieving a positive outcome from a biological as well as a financial perspective.  He expressed his own preferences for certain protocols and also adjusted to accommodate my preferences readily.  He patiently answered all my questions when I didn't understand something clearly. Dr. Spandorfer himself was great. I called me personally from his cell phone whilst commuting on the train to discuss test results and was a very competent doctor. However, at this practice you see your actual doctor fairly infrequently, and the clinic's antiquated communication style got in the way of patient care. Fertility Medicine is a calling to Dr. Elias. It is evident in the time he takes to CAREFULLY and RESPECTIVELY explain your course of treatments. My first IVF with resulted in a live birth of a health baby girl. He PERSONALLY came an did the transfer and the retrieval of the eggs. I have a history of Fibroids and myomectomies so he thought we might need to do an abdominal retrieval. My second IVF with him was unsuccesful - but in all fairness I was almost 45 at the time trying to go with my own eggs. In my heart, I knew my changes were low, but I still wanted to try. He did not discourage me at all - he said my uterus was totally fine. In the second IVF, we did an abdominal retrieval and got just 3 eggs and transfered 3 embryos. Sadly, I did not get pregnant, but I cannot complain too much, because Dr Elias helped me have my first child at the age of 42 with my own eggs- my chances then were just about 5%. I have referred 2 of my friends to him and they all have families of their own too. I will remain eternally grateful to him and will continue to refer patients to him!Dr. Kang was recommended to me by a friend.  She has good bedside manner.  She always knew my medical history when I saw her.  She throughly explained her recommendations.  She was optimistic, perhaps overly so.  She responded to my results with changes in protocol.  Each round was more successful than the one before.  Although we did not have success, we stuck with her because we felt the continuity of treatment was important.  A kind and familiar face, Dr. Kang was a comfort during a challenging and stressful period of my life.Dr. Chung provided a good overview of the different levels of med protocols that the Cornell reproductive program utilizes (there are five different levels). He also explained that the 3 key ingredients for success are egg, sperm, and uterus. When my first IVF cycle that led to a transfer failed, he explained that it was a matter of luck. He remained optimistic and encouraged us to keep trying. He said that it's a matter of finding a good egg. 

From my perspective, my experience at Cornell would have been more optimal had I been able to see Dr. Chung all throughout monitoring, retrievals and transfers.  Also, my very first IVF cycle was canceled because the eggs did not respond to the injectibles. I have since consulted with three other REs who stated they would not have recommended that particular protocol for my situation. But I do understand that it is generally a matter of trial and error and that each woman can respond differently to med protocols. Samantha Pfeifer was very polite, cheerful and had great bedside manners. Our meetings with her were precise; she had answers to all our questions; she never dismissed any of our concerns as silly or stupid. She constantly evaluated my health, and my fertility journey to modify the approach so as to achieve success in an optimum number of cycles.I met with Dr Davis for the initial consultation, which included a sit down session in which he reviewed and discussed my prior medical records I had faxed to his office earlier. At the initial visit he also did a physical exam including a breast exam. He also performed the hysterosalpingogram. After that, most of the contact with Dr. Davis was by phone or communications through his dedicated nursing staff. He always explained his reasoning and sounded hopeful without making any promises. She was extremely helpful every treatment and cycle. Always took the time to explain everything and answervall my questions and never rushed me. She was compassionate and understanding and made us feel very comfortable. She didn’t overwhelm us and wasn’t rude or harsh, she spoke to us with respect and care. I couldn’t say enough good things. Upon my first meeting he was already read up on my whole chart and practically recited to me. He listened to all my questions and concerns and was very optimistic and hopeful as we proceeded. Although nothing was ever guaranteed he did say anything can happen and that kept me in good spirits. I always felt there was a genuine concern for me as a patient. He followed up with calls after every procedure to make sure I was ok.He had relatively good bedside manner. I just wish I was able to be in contact with him directly more often. He was best at our first consultation, but after that I only saw him a couple more times during monitoring.Dr. Kligman was a nice man, who initially appeared to be great. However he spent less than 10 mins face to face time with me to discuss my results and diagnosis. He was reluctant to elaborate on reasons or causes for my diagnosis. When I asked questions (I am from a medical background); he was flippant, a little arrogant about the answers. He prescribed too low a dose of the treatment drug decided on. His office contacted me to congratulate me on pregnancy when it was clear by the numbers and my history of a previous chemical pregnancy that I was having another chemical pregnancy. It was impossible to contact him-having to leave a voicemail for his administrators, who would take 24hours to call you back. He never called me back-he always had a nurse (who is unaware of your medical history) call you back. This clinic is a conveyor belt. The waiting room is not discrete with nurses coming out and just shouting your name out so that the other 100 people in the room can hear it. Dr. Spandorfer has an excellent bedside manner. He puts you at ease with his humor. He gives you hope even in the most grim situation while still being frank about the circumstances. He gave me treatment even when a previous doctor had given me no hope. When the first round of IVF was unsuccessful, he carefully tailored and alternative method of treatment for the next cycle. Ultimately, he helped me to successfully have a baby girl and for that I am eternally grateful to him.In my earlier response, I described Dr Chung as a very compassionate and supportive doctor.  He has great bedside manner, and he never rushed me along.  He is very caring.  He did a couple of the ultrasounds and his technique was gentle. I've had other doctors at Cornell perform the ultrasound and it just felt like they were jabbing me and causing discomfort, without any recognition that it was painful.  He is smart and Cornell is a good clinic with a good reputation. I personally had a very bad experience. I was overmedicated so of my 24 eggs none made it to day 5. Dr. Goldschlag was hard to get in touch with so I often felt very in the dark.She definitely knows what she's doing and has all the protocols down that she uses and can troubleshoot as the cycle progresses to get you where you need to be. She's very professional and quick when she needs to be during those morning appts when there are so many women waiting for their bloodwork, ultrasounds, etc. You can feel rushed when you're with her but that's not totally her fault if the clinic takes on so many patients. I realize she's very busy but sometimes I would have preferred to talk to her directly instead of the nurse when they'd call with results and the instructions for the upcoming days.Dr. Reichman really took the time to talk us through all of our options and helped us make difficult decisions.  I felt like I received a very high level of care. I liked that he was more cautious  than other Drs.  He gave us personal attention and took the time to talk by phone and email when we had any questions,   I'd recommend to anyone. We had a great experience with Dr. Schattman. He can be quite direct and blunt, but we appreciated the honesty and felt like he always managed our expectations. He is extremely confident in the answers he gave us and we always felt like we were in good hands. 

Not only did we appreciate his expertise, but also his compassion. He tried his best to empathize with us during difficult times and join in the laughter in happy moments. 



Dr. Kang was very well-meaning, but she completely missed the mark in diagnosing my case with her cut-and-dry approach to my two late first-trimester losses. She concludes, based on my losses, thar my egg quality was more poor than my age of 32 would suggest, and chalked it up to genetics. What she failed to discover was that I do indeed have a mild case of PCOS. She was aware that my younger sister had a strong case of PCOS and never bothered to run any additional diagnostic blood work (testosterone levels, hemoglobin a1c), which are suggestive that I have it. If she had not been so dismissive, my issues might have been treated simply with metformin. Instead, I had 5 unsuccessful cycles with her over the course of a year. Complete waste of time. 

In addition, when it came to my thyroid, which was slightly elevated, she started me off on too high of a dose. When we later dialed it back, my body had become resistant to the lower dose. She should have been more measured in treating this condition. 

Similarly, with her dosage suggestion on my first injectable cycle, my estrogen skyrocketed and I was at risk of hyperstimulation. She never cautioned me not to exercise and should definitely have kept me on a more conservative dose. 
I always felt I was treated as individual. Dr. Reichman was always personable and offered clear explanations. I especially appreciated his detail to follow up and quick responses with emails and immediate concerns. He presents a caring and understanding bedside manner. I felt I was in good hands immediately, especially after transferring from RMA where I did not feel comfortable at all. He has a natural instinct with patients and a sincere temperament during some very emotionally trying times.I went to Dr Rosenwaks after hearing countless stories about his success in treating patients who had suffered failures with other doctors. He presents as the deeply experienced, obsessive practitioner he is.  He is the best kind of Doctor: confident, process-oriented, curious, and dedicated to helping patients achieve their goals. He has seen it all, and that gave me confidence that if I put myself in his care, I would get pregnant. He was there for me whenever I needed him, puzzling through scenarios and cracking my code. After a failed transfer, his nurse told me he took my records home to have time to quietly reflect and be sure he hadn't missed anything.  He hadn't, we proceeded, and I was pregnant on the next try.  He is a consummate professional, so he won't cry with you, but if and when you need that, you can lean on his amazing staff of nurses and the incomparable practice head, Wally. I wanted the most experienced, smartest, devoted, results-oriented Doctor I could find and Dr Rosenwaks is absolutely that.  Dr. Goldshlag is cordial, knowledgeable, and thorough. He explains procedures clearly with plenty of detail. He offers options to patients that might need them. Dr. Goldshlag and his staff are constantly revising their practice to reflect newer technology, chemistry and more scientifically beneficial procedures for his current patients and for future ones.Dr. Schlegel is a highly regarded male factor infertility specialist who pioneered micro-TESE. I felt he was incredibly knowledgeable and humble despite having patients who travel to see him worldwide. We went to a different clinic for our first child and wanted to try a different place for our second.  Dr. Pfeifer sat with us at our initial consult and went through all of the medical records and discussed them.  She was impressed with my knowledge of treatment and therefore didn't dumb things down for me.  She was friendly and warm, but also had a plan of action that she was ready to put into motion immediately.  I saw her at every monitoring appointment, and I always felt like she knew exactly what was going on with me.  She also performed my tests and was really good about going over results.  I mentioned in a previous response. I felt like Dr Schattman knew right from the start what protocol I should have, and he was always in control of what is next. He set my mind at ease after 3 miscarriages and having zero control over my care.See ""why I think he treated us like humans"".  He is kind without being patronizing. He specializes in helping women post-cancer and genuinely seems to appreciate that the tock is clicking and we want results fast, but balances that with the idea of starting with the least invasive (so, least expensive and least risky) treatment first. He helped us set limits upfront. Do we want 6 rounds of IUI before starting hormones? How comfortable are we with multiples?  Etc. He also seems really good at timing the treatments to the specific 18 (?)-hour window when it's most likely to work. She makes up things (for example: my ovaries are ""too small"") to manipulate a patient to do the AMH blood test to push a 36 year old to do IVF after only 1 failed IUI.  In a HSG, she's too rough and doesn't succeed in threading the catheter into my uterus so instead she uses a pliar-like device that causes a lot of pain and damage/blood loss to the cervix.  She instructs me to do an IUI 48 hours after the HCG trigger shot, even her nurse told me the timing was wrong.Going through this process was an emotional and exhausting experience. Dr. Reichman did his best to help me understand what I would experience and provided me with realistic expectations. I felt fortunate that I was able to email him with any questions because things move quickly in the appointments and I would generally think of things after I left. I never worried that I wouldn't hear from him or a nurse to put me at ease. No one likes to hear that they are fat: even if its the truth, its hurts. It hurts more when you hear that your weight is the barrier to you getting pregnant. Did I need to hear it to get the swift kick in the pants to make a change IMMEDIATELY? Yes. Did I like hearing it? No. I was pretty devastated for a day or so, but I appreciated his honesty vs sugar coating things.  After that first conversation, we knew exactly what steps we were going to take to get me pregnant, and at what point we'd move on to Option B. He was very available, and I had his email address and cell # from Day 1.  I actually emailed him on the Saturday morning after taking a pregnancy test that was positive, and he responded immediately to come in without an appointment on Monday morning. Every time we had test results (blood tests for pregnancy & then genetic testing), he called me personally. I sincerely appreciated that.I really liked Dr. Davis, but I also really liked and respected the entire team at Cornell.  This is important because you don't often see your own doctor - you see whomever is in charge of monitoring hours on a given morning, and the doctor who does your retrieval is whomever happens to be on call that day.  So I only saw Dr. Davis for my initial consult and one time when he happened to be doing monitoring hours.  But I thought that all of the nurses and doctors at Cornell were excellent.  Everything went exactly as described, all of the staff were 100% on top of giving me clear instructions every day, and I never had to wonder what was going on or feel like I didn't know what to do next.

Dr. Davis himself is great.  He took a lot of time to explain the options to me, and provided data on probability of success in detailed terms that I really appreciated.  I am a scientifically oriented person, and I found that a few other doctors who I consulted with really glossed over the data, when I wanted to hear hard credible facts.  Dr. Davis respected me and provided the information I wanted.  He is compassionate but also got right to the point.  And most importantly, I have full trust in his medical abilities.  I was never scared that I was going to be overstimulated, because Dr. Davis and his team made it seem like they were doing an excellent job of monitoring me closely.  

I was not a complicated case, so maybe this isn't all due to Dr. Davis' skill, but I got a beautiful result, more than I even expected, with basically no side effects.  I was just thrilled that I decided to do elective egg retrieval and freezing, and I would 110% recommend Dr. Davis and Cornell to anyone else considering it.Dr. Davis is very knowledgeable and is able to convey all information clearly.  He is soft spoken, but confident.  He prepared me for each upcoming event so I knew what to expect.  He answered any and all questions I had throughout the 14 months I was his patient. My primary doctor was Dr. Kang. I really liked her. She called me at important points of our cycle. Dr. Kliegman performed one of my ultrasounds and then my egg retrieval and I felt he was a little rough and did not have a warm bedside manner. When Dr. Kang called me the evening of my retrieval, she apologized for him. She was at another location on the day of my planned transfer and went out of her way to see me after her clinic and perform the transfer herself. She also trained/residency with my local ob-gyn, so maybe she felt like she needed to go out of the way to be more personableDr. Spandorfer was good to work with.  He's pretty down to earth, pleasantly jocular (but professional), and in my experience was able to both level with me and my husband as well as be sensitive at tough times.   He also rolled with my husband's inappropriate sense of humor.I felt like Dr. Schattman always had my best interest at heart. He listened to me and understood what we were trying to achieve and came up with the best course of action to achieve it. He was patient and kind and very prompt with his responses. I do wish that he spoke in more laymans terms as it was sometimes hard to follow what he was saying. Sometimes I would need to call back and have him explain what he said again but he always did so. He tried to be there for most of my appointments and did end up doing my second retrieval. We felt more confident having him do it than another doctor. He is very to the point and honest.  I found him warm and friendly but I could see how others might not.  He has a good sense of humor and a good perspective on the serious work he does. My husband and I trusted him and liked him.Dr Davis is a wonderful Doctor. I loved the fact that he always had a plan. I was devastated after all my failed cycles and he was able to give me confidence that he knew what he was doing and that it would work out well. I would definitely recommend him for anyone dealing with infertility, specially for people with difficult diagnosis.
The only negative aspect of my experience was that I felt he considered me as an easy case since I was young and did not investigate why I was not getting pregnant before starting me on fertility treatment. After 2 failed iui and 2 failed ivf he decided to perform a histeroscopy and found out I had a polyp- after the procedure I did my final ivf and got pregnant. I wish I had done the histeroscopy before starting with treatments Strengths: He does seem to know what he is doing, is very plugged into the latest research/reports/technology and treatment, is positive  - never for a second do i think i won't get pregnant eventually - and this is weird but he has the gentlest touch with sonograms - literally don't feel a thing. He also did surgery to remove my right tube - and i have recovered with no issues and the tiniest scares.

Weaknesses: During what was the most painful (physically and emotionally) time - during my ectopic pregnancy - he hardly checked in on me, I felt totally in the dark, he was very cavalier about surgery vs. drugs to remove, and once the surgery was over didn't call to check up on me that night or the next day. I had a very bad reaction to anesthesia and the hospital was forcing me to leave…if he had called i'm sure they would have treated me differently. And then when I got home I was panicked that I felt so bad, was bleeding, etc - and felt like I didn't know what to expect/what was normal/what wasn't.

Right now I'm deciding if I want to stay with him for future treatment or see someone else in the practice. I answered some of this in the previous question but I would say Dr. Spandorfer was not a hand holder but he was efficient clear and willing to work with me despite my diminished ovarian reserve.  And by work with me I mean he was willing to do an egg retrieval and insemination and a transfer even with very few eggs produced by stimulation -- which by the way I had gotten from other doctors with various mixes of medication so I think it was inevitable .I was referred to Dr. Kang by a friend, and I will be forever grateful to her. I have since recommended Dr. Kang to numerous friends dealing with infertility. Because of her, not only do I have my beautiful twin boys, but I stopped feeling so sorry for myself during the process of trying to get pregnant. It was a process, and my husband and I felt like Dr. Kang was on our team. When the first IVF transfer took but then ended in a chemical pregnancy, we were sad and frustrated, but Dr. Kang made us feel like there was always a plan, always a goal to focus on, and we would just keep adjusting the plan until we reached our goal. She is incredibly straightforward, not super warm and fuzzy, but neither are we. I wasn't looking for a therapist or a friend, I was looking for a doctor who would guide us through this process and work with us until we got there. She didn't sugar coat things, but (different from a past experience with a different doctor) even when she was delivering bad news, I felt like she was our partner and that we would get through it. We felt like she gave us all the information we needed to make decisions and keep moving forward; she didn't confuse us, and she was able to relay info and options to us in a way that we completely understood, even if it was complicated. She thoughtfully answered every question we ever asked, no matter how silly or basic. And when we finally got pregnant with our twins (we transferred 2 embryos the second time during a natural/frozen cycle), and we heard the heartbeats, we cried, and Dr. Kang hugged us both, and it was a real celebration of finally achieving our common goal. We did not feel like we were just another medical chart. I still think of her often, and look forward to the day I return to her when we're ready for baby #3. I cannot speak more highly of her.I was referred to him after going to a private practice. He wasn't as warm as my other Doctor but he was great. He's nice and cracks a few jokes to lighten the mood. Any time I hear of someone having fertility issues I would send them to him in a heartbeat. He's in the baby making business and he's great at it...and he has all the resources at Cornell which put my expeience on a different playing field. My original Doctor told me day 1 - ""we'll get you pregnant"" which was all I wanted go hear at the time. I loved him but at this stage with Something so personal and upsetting you need more than a nice Doctor and a positive attitude. 5 clomid cycles and iui's later no baby I had to go to the professionals. Ive never regretted my decision to go see Dr. Chung, my only regret is that I never tried an IUI at Cornell because I had exhausted all my benefits for it (and a personally paid one). Watching IUIs discussed with other patients there it was a very different run operation that at my original Doctor. As mentioned, he could be very curt in the morning. He doesn't answer a lot of questions and he can have a cold bedside manner. You have to do your homework on infertility and come prepared to ask the right questions. When I did have bad news, he showed more compassion. Very nice, very sweet but very thorough and direct. Did a great job keeping us informed of our different protocols and the reasoning behind them. Also did a great job keeping our spirits high. As a fellow Asian American, my wife found it very easy to trust and relate to Dr. Kang. She was the perfect balance of warmth and bluntness.  Compared to our previous doctor (Dr. Hershlog) and clinic, the difference was almost night and day. Dr. Kang's practice was efficient, organized, and didn't feel as much like a ""IVF Factory"" like other clinics. Unethical is the only way I can describe this doctor. There was zero communication. He should have told me the chances I had of conceiving with the one terrible embryo I had - Day 3, 5-cell, very fragmented. I didn't know any better at the time. And since I hadn't heard from the doctor, thought that I could and should trust he knew what he was doing. But the transfer should have been canceled. There was never any medication adjustment at all during the stimulation period - I was given the strongest, maximum dosage and suffered with it. Terrible, uncaring doctor. He should not be practising at a prestigious institution like Weil Cornell.Dr. Elias was always a pleasure to see. He was always kind and patient when I had a lot of questions. He called me after hours when he needed to tell me important information related to my care. Dr. Elias has a wonderful bedside manner. I really liked Dr. Kang and her enjoyed her bedside manner. She is very knowledgeable and gives full detail and info of what is happening. I felt well educated under her care. She explained what were the first steps, then what we move to next if those don't work, and we were successful after injectables. That said, if you need more personal or emotional support she might not be right for you. I recommended her to a friend who did not have a positive outcome and has since moved to a different practice. I believe her choice has more to do with the overall size of Weill Cornell than Dr. Kang specifically, and she has moved to a smaller/more personal setting. I credit him with the birth of my twin girls and could not have been happier with my choice.  He is a brilliant doctor -- creative and always trying to find the right solution for his patient, not what works for most patients.  He did a hysteroscopy on me to look at my uterus before starting fertility treatments, suspecting that I may have some scarring that was preventing implantation.  And he was right -- I have significant scarring from a D&C the year before that my previous doctor had never thought to look for.  He promptly returned my calls and was thoughtful in answering all my questions.  And he treated me like an individual -- I always felt as though I had very personal care.  I cannot recommend him highly enough.  If there is any weakness, I would say that the practice is large and other doctors often perform retrievals, monitor progress, etc. on a rotation.  But the doctors at Weill Cornell are all exceptional, so it didn't cause concern.  Dr. Davis was always available by email or phone if I felt I needed to check in with him.It would be impossible to overemphasize how amazing my experience as a patient of Dr. Spandorfer's was.  He took me as a patient, despite a history of failed IVF.  At the time, many clinics were not taking patients like me because they didn't want to mess up their high ratings.  He was patient and kind with me - and most importantly, there's now a beautiful little girl who exists because of him.  I owe him my new life as a mom.As I said, he's kind, respectful, and provides as much detail as one wants to know about one's treatment.  And most importantly, he was willing to take me on as a patient when no one else at any of the major fertility centers in NYC, Boston, SF, or Baltimore would (because I was 42, and had very poor ovarian reserve and endometriosis), and he was willing to keep trying for years despite terrible odds until he really thought my chances of conceiving with my own egg had become impossible and was no longer comfortable continuing to try.  And even then, when I requested going back to doing unmedicated IUIs so as not to waste even a single chance while awaiting donor eggs, he was willing to listen to me and do them.  Thank goodness!  Because on the second one I got pregnant with my wonderful, normal, healthy son!He talks fast, but explains everything, and doesn't sugar-coat. I am a scientific professional and I want to be given accurate information -- and I was. I was a surprisingly challenging patient -- came in as obstructive male factor, but stimmed like 5 years older than I actually was -- so we did some crazy estrogen-priming protocol when I was still 37 and it WORKED for kid #2. Plus: he's super kind.Dr. Schattman is caring, doesn’t create false expectations.He is good at answering questions but you want to make sure you ask them.He makes you feel safe. He is friendly and has a very good reputation in the clinic. Nurses and staff seem to trust him and speak highly of him. I feel fortunate to have worked with Dr. Pfeifer. Her professionalism and bedside manner is unmatched! 
She is understanding and really wants the very best for her patients. I do wish it was easier to get in touch with her. During tough times, it is helpful to have that level of understanding.He is thoughtful and patient. Allows me to voice all my questions and concerns. Doesn’t pressure me about tough decisions or pass judgement. He is happy to consult with other doctors on my behalf, and regularly calls me to follow up with questions. Dr. Spandorfer is friendly and easy to approach. That said, he does not organically take the time to explain every detail. If you have questions or want more description, the burden is on you, as the patient, to ask. I do think he’s a skilled doctor and I trust his opinions but if you have trouble with patient advocacy, he may not be the best fit. We trusted Dr. Reichman implicitly and felt so much support and care from him and his team. Dr. Reichman was truly invested in our journey and we loved his communication style, bed side manner and general care. He weighs out all of the options in a very upfront and honest way, while providing data driven advise and support. I cannot say enough amazing things about Dr. Reichman. It was a very, very bitter sweet day the day we graduated from his practice!! I read many positive reviews about Dr. Reichman before seeing him and he lived up to all the praise. He was attentive, knowledgable and I truly felt like I was in good hands. I never doubted his recommendations and I was always able to get in touch with him when I needed to. He gave me his email during our first consultation and told me to email him if I ever had any questions between appointments. Whenever I did, he almost always responded by the end of the day.Dr. Pereira is very knowledgeable, professional, and moves quickly, so that time doesn't go to waste. I am very new to the process, but what I loved most about him was that he wasn't quick to jump to IVF. Dr. Pereira was willing to explore why I am experiencing infertility and his first course of action was to attempt to correct the problem first. In my case, I have a blocked fallopian tube and thankfully, Dr. Pereira specializes in correcting the issues associated with the fallopian tube. Dr Pfeifer is wonderful - she truly connects with her patients, has a good balance of optimism and realism, she is patient and listens.  She cares - whenever I run into her outside of the office, she remembers me and stops to have a real conversation.  She is rude and superficial. She explained very little, spent very little time and mishandled our needs. We ended up seeing other physicians who actually spent time with us, explained everything and have had the results we hoped for originally. Our experience was more stressful than it should have been all because she did not take the time to explain things. Like that she wouldn't be doing the actual IUI but a resident instead. I work with physicians. I come from a family of physicians and her bedside manners are deplorable. Dr. Pereria is very sensitive to what you are going through and very interested in doing whatever it takes for his patients. I always feel like he is realistic yet hopeful which is needed when going through something as tough as infertility and IVF. He answers every question my husband and I have with no judgement. Dr Schelegel was excellent at recognizing an issue that other doctors had previously not seen. He presented a surgical procedure that while not completely eliminating the infertility issue, did allow for increased sperm production that allowed for a successful ICSI IVF He's very nice and has a good bedside manner.  However, I feel like he has so many patients that he has not suggested any out of the box treatment to me such as mini-IVF or different dosage of medications.  I had to do some research and suggest different protocols.Dr. Reichman is a thorough communicator, kind and gets to know his patients. He gave me all of the information and took time to understand my goals and I felt empowered to make the decision that was best for me. I try not to bother him with all of my questions and often will call the nurse, but he will often be the one to respond. I am shocked at how he can manage to remember all of his patients.She is up front and told me from the beginning I didnt have much time.  She encouraged me to still try everything but was understanding in my hesitations.  She is realistic and I found her to refine protocols specifically for me which I appreciate.  She will also listen and make time for any questions I have.   She is young and knowledgeable  and willing to do what it takes.  My visits with Dr. Kligman were extremely brief. When I asked questions, I received short answers and not much explanation. I was often made to feel as though I should already know the answers to the questions I asked. I believe he is thorough and careful, especially when tweaking the protocol for each cycle, but I wish he were more forthcoming with details, and spent more time making sure his patients felt informed and clear about their current status as well as future steps.Dr. Davis fully explained every aspect of the process in a warm and compassionate manner. This was important to be as it was my first cycle and I'm generally an anxious person. I trusted him entirely and everything went exactly as he described. Dr. Kang is forward with information if asked and will always include me in the decisions. For example, when making a decision about how many embryos to transfer. Dr. Kang is caring and I feel like I'm more than just a number.We have been very happy with him.  He has been straightforward and responsive.  He did a great job stimulating me and getting lots of eggs.  Once we realized it was truly an egg quality issue, he led us through the donor process.  We miscarried twice after a donor transfer. Once from a Cvs and once from a genetic abnormality and he was extremely compassionate.  Dr Schattman is very knowledgeable and cares about his patients. You can see him for morning monitoring on specific days if you go to the UES location. 
Appointments are generally quick and there isn't much time for chit chat - so come prepared with your questions. I am still a patient of Dr. Schattman's and am hoping my next course of treatment is successful. He was very direct and to the point. He was not a hand holder but I was not looking for that in my doctor. He made me aware of every step we were taking and how the process would work. I felt comfortable with every step we took knowing he had my best interest in mind. We kept my doses low and slow and he seemed confident in his decision the entire time. I really like Dr. Elias. He is very smart, well researched and overall, a good doctor. However, I think my case was just out of his scope and he, nor anyone else at Cornell, was willing to think outside of the box. I thought Dr Davis was very knowledgeable regarding my case and studies in general. Any questions I had for him, he addressed and reassured me of his reasoning behind the protocol. Will be using him again for baby #2. Dr.Kligman is very knowledgeable, listens thoroughly, and very caring. He always made sure that all of my questions were answered or that I was comfortable with a treatment decision. The clinic is large and has many patients, but he and his team make sure that you are not lost in the mix. Dr. Kang was a real person who communicated well.  She did not sugar coat things but was sure to present both the positive and negative information related to each step of the process.  I appreciated her thoroughness and also her ability to guide our decision process throughout. she was great- she was easy to talk to and was a good listener.  she had a great energy about her and just pleasant to deal with.  i sincerely felt she cared about me. and, i felt that she was experienced to make the right decisions.  i would recommend her to anyone.  Dr. Kang is a lover of numbers, and often communicates using statistics and percentages. She has had a lot of experience, and draws on that experience when speaking to patients about their treatment plan. While some people might find this comforting, I often became frustrated with Dr. Kang for what felt like a lack of a personalized approach. I sometimes had press her for her real opinion- it sometimes felt like she was being wishy washy about the treatment plan, or reluctant to give advice. Of course patients need to decide what's best for them , but Dr. Kang wasn't really willing to even participate in the weighing of options. She just gave us the facts and told us to decide what to do. Dr. Goldschlag is smart and reasonable, and unlike many (most??) of the other doctors at Cornell, he is extremely patient and compassionate. Not arrogant or rushed at all. She seemed to care but had low hopes that my ovaries would produce enough eggs each time. She also was not supported of my plan to use a midwife during the pregnancy once I was discharged from the IVF clinic.  Also I wish I could have spoken to her more - whenever I had a question and left a message for her, it was rarely her who called me back.I felt he was the gentlest of the doctors when it came time to an internal sonogram with the wand. He did explain what the procedures were. I liked him. I felt he listened to me. I did feel somewhat like a textbook case--that we had to do things in a certain order.Dr. Spandorfer did not have much of a bedside manor.  He is not warm at all and had no hope for me getting pregnant.  He told me I had ""less than 5% chance of getting pregnant"".  After that conversation I decided to switch doctors.  My next doctor was successful at getting me pregnant with my own eggs after only one IVF.Often felt like a number, she practices evidence based medicine but could use a little more empathy.


 My husband thinks she is very robotic about her practice, I trust her skills. 

Have not yet had the outcome we desire but am still under her care because we do trust her. Dr. Reichman was thorough and communicative. He explained procedures and options in detail. I am currently pregnant with our first child from our first ivf so I am obviously overjoyed at the result. I have recommended him to friends and colleagues. Positive attitude, compassionate, honest. He walks on water, as far as I’m concerned! Really tried his best to counter the “I feel like in a factory” sentiment. Personalized treatment. Gave me a clear idea (as much as possible) about what to expect next.We went to a few places for consults and both my husband and I liked his style and approach. He was direct and informative and realistic. He explained to us the science first and why certain things were going to happen. Even though he rarely did our monitoring ultrasounds, when there were issues, he called us directly and was helpful about answering all of our questions.So far my wife and I have only performed Clomid and IUI. We are now about to go into IVF treatment. I was very happy with the doctor's approach with my wife. He was very sensitive to my wifes emoutional needs and also answered all our questions.Dr. Kang is a very talented and analytical doctor. She was able to speak with us in a way that we completely understood what was happening and why. She has been very realistic about our pros and cons and our chances. I would absolutely recommend Dr Reichman. He is very thorough in his assessment, explains all the options well and doesn't sugarcoat the situation. Thanks to his evaluation and treatment I was able to get pregnant from my first frozen transfer. Overall great Doctor. She is really honest and try’s her best to make me as comfortable as possible. She allows me to express myself and takes my concerns into consideration. When I email her she responds really quick. Soft spoken and reassuring.
Creates a treatment plan that accommodates my needs.
Incredibly compassionate. 
Treatment is not one size fits all, he will tailor your treatment to your personal fertility history.
She is wonderful and we will be going back to her for our second baby. The first day we went to her after having two terrible failed cycles with RMA NYC, she told us ""i will get you pregnant"" and she did on our first try! She was very smart and made all the right calls.m which is what counts when it comes to a fertility doctor. Cornell has A LOT of patients and is very busy, but knowing Doc Kang was looking at all our test results and making the game plan was all we needed. Dr. Kang was very honest and direct. She discussed all options and their potential risks. My husband often accompanied me to my appointments and she included him in the conversation (my previous doctor spoke down to my husband). She was warm and caring when we were struggling, and kept our optimism alive when we needed it most. Because there are so many patients at WC, there are times when other doctors cover the routine visits, but you mostly see Dr. Kang. I highly recommend her. He has a strong reputation with many success stories. He is very honest and reliable. The clinic is excellent. I was able to get pregnant while being treated with him. 
However he could take more time explaining the patient his view on the patient history and leveraging all the patient history. Sometimes he might seem distant and not always available for check ups or retrieval.As a patient, Dr. Kang was extremely customized on my treatment path.  I so appreciated that she did my extractions, as that was important to me.  She helped me take it one step at a time.  I would highly recommend her to anyone who wants to do an aggressive, customized plan.I really liked him having as my doctor. Unfortunately our treatment didn't end up with babies but if I had the finances I would go back to him. He explained everything very clearly. He doesn't give false hope but he is always on the positive side. He answers everything very clearly. Even though he seems so many patients he knew what I do and was always asking how I am doing in my job etc. Dr. Reichman is an extremely knowledgeable doctor. I always felt comfortable with him. He is respectful, confident and kind. He had a plan in place and when times called for further testing and investigation he thoroughly discussed my options with me. He was available via email throughout the day and responded when he could. He was a good and attentive doctor. Listened to my needs and answered all my questions. Most of the time I had an appointment he was there. He communicated all the issues I was having and provided solutions. I think he needed to be a little more aggressive with the injections but that’s my opinion.He is not overly warm and is very matter of fact in his approach but he is not cold and uncaring either. His confidence and calm demeanor and the gentleness in exams was exactly what I needed from the first consultation appointment to appointments when it was clear that a pregnancy was probably going fail, to happy pregnancy appointments. I believe that Dr. Spandorfer is good at performing the medical side of his job although he lacks thorough communication skills and has a poor bedside manner. He was always on time and I rarely had to wait. I think that he's amazing - caring, smart, empathic, knowledgable and very trustworthy.  I think the facility has become a bit of a factory and they sometimes forget to tell you things [the office I used for monitoring moved between cycles 2 and 3 and I went to the wrong place]He an incredibly trustworthy doctor. He specializes in Fallopian tube surgery which is why I originally sought him out. He’s performed two surgeries with me and he was too notch both times. We are currently working through a fertility treatment now. He is funny, relaxed and extremely clear. I trusted him completely. He goes out of his way to put you at ease and lessen your fertility stress and anxiety. He is interested in you and how you are doing. He's very knowledgeable and experienced. He's open to patient suggestsions and always open to discussing options. He does not email however and you have to leave a message with his admin and hope you catch his return call. This can be frustrating. Dr Davis is very knowledgeable and professional. He will also listen to your needs and concerns and is willing to change the plan per your request. He is kind and genuinely cares about the patient. He could quote various research result to support his ideas. He will always try different thing to see if it works. Dr. Spandorfer is incredibly dedicated, experienced, hard working and on top of everything.  His tone is not super emotional - that was perfect for us.  I found his manner refreshing and that it made the process less emotionally daunting for me.Great bedside mannerisms. Explains things in great detail. Seems to be genuinely concerned for our results. Listens to my concerns. Adjusts the protocol appropriately. Performs further testing for further assessment of our issues.I could not recommend him more highly. There is truly something to be said for the continuity and personalized care you feel you are getting by seeing the same doctor each time. He is amazing and delivered. I’m pregnant!He is a great doctor and very knowledgeable of the field. He tailor my treatment specifically as I went in there for Fertility preservation prior to my chemo treatment for breast cancer. He was able to see me right away. After the cancer treatment, I was able to get pregnant naturally but miscarried, so he suggested to do IUI with clomid. Worked first round, I am going back there for 2nd soon. Dr Braverman ensured that he could help me. I live in Jamaica and I travel to the states to see him. I knew about him by merely researching on the internet and coming across his page. I have no regrets. I've had 7 miscarriages and one 24 weeker who died at 30 days old. After meeting with Dr Braverman last year in 2017, I left his office having hope that i could be a parent one day. He ran tests on both my husband and myself and he treated me accordingly.  I'm now the proud mother of a sweet boy who was born on April 2, 2018. Dr. Braverman is the most brilliant doctor. He also always responds to my emails in very good timing. He truly deserves an award.Dr. Reichman was cautiously optimistic and presented me with positive and negative what if’s. He was realistic and guided me to measure my expectations. He was very kind and supportive. He explained everything and respected my lack of knowledge in this field.Dr. Spandorfer came highly recommended to me by a friend who had previously used him and now has two babies. As someone with a more difficult case (due to numerous unexplained miscarriages), I was hoping to have someone who was more compassionate to my experience and offer his opinion on why he felt things didn't work out. Dr. Spandorfer doesn't volunteer much information and to get any answers, you really have to ask him. Even then, his answers are extremely brief.He is one of the best doctors, so people say.  However he lacks any personal skills.  He does not like telling patients details or answering many questions.  He is incredibly hard to reach via phone when needed.I felt like I was in the best care possible when I was treated by Dr. Reichman. He is very knowledgeable and has great bed side manner-he gives you the facts in terms you can understand but is also very compassionate. He was with you throughout the process, actually caring for your best interest and just an amazing doctor.  I cannot say enough good things about what an amazing Doctor he is. I still keep in touch with him and my babies are 3 months old!  WarriorDr kang was very personable and compassionate. after examining me she assured me that i would be pregnant in no time and i was roughly 3 weeks later. although that pregnancy resulted in miscarriage she showed empathy but was also a confidence booster. she was great at encouraging me to keep going and assuring me that things was going to be ok and it was. i was pregnant again 6 weeks later. This time with a healthy pregnancy. so thanks to her.He spoke to us in layman terms and was able to clarify all of our questions. 
Even when we showed up to ask more questions he said he was only a phone call away. That really made us feel at home despite the emotional IVF process.
Always calm and respectful. Dr Chung was extremely compassionate and had a good bedside manner. However, I only saw him 2x during my entire cycle and had a very difficult time getting a hold of him. Many times I had to wait over an hour for blood work and ultrasound only to be seen by a doctor I have never met. The protocol he recommended was one that I had already done, which hadn't worked previously and didn't work with him. After changing clinics I saw better results elsewhere. Dr. Davis gave us hope and assurance while at the same time advising us of the raw facts regarding our cycle. He changed protocols depending on response and was very responsive to our numerous questions and concerns. Could not ask for a better partner in our fertility journey. Thoughtful, accessible, patient, upfront, listened to my thoughts/ideas without judgement, supportive. Great team of nurses, allowed me to email them any time. Dr emails with me, as well. All this provides comfort to my mind as the process can be so daunting. She was an amazing doctor who was very compassionate and very knowledgable. I felt very safe and comfortable in her care.Dr. Rosenwaks is very thorough and requires all exams/testing be done there as he really wants accurate info.  He always communicated with me directly including calling me on my cell phone when we needed to make an urgent decision.Dr. Reichman was very knowledgeable and caring. He wanted me to go straight to IVF but I wanted to try a couple of rounds of IUI first, he was supportive of it but was realistic with my expectations. Dr Elias is part of a large practice. Although a great doctor, his time can appear to be limited perhaps due to the large hospital system he is part of. Extremely result driven. Very uptodate on literature and ongoing trial data.Dr. R New what he was doing. He was very efficient about the whole process, and was ready to do the IUI before I had even chosen a donor, by which I mean he was faster about the process than even I was.See prior entry about human vs. number.Dr Reichman is a very professional Dr, practical and caring. He was straight forward with us and did the best according to our specific circumstances. We wish we would have started with him, we would had saved a lot of time, energy and emotional difficulty.
He did a great job asking questions and being supportive of my journey.  He did things with my meds that allowed for the most eggs retrieved and the best graded embryos I had up until that point. He was direct and honest.Weill Cornell is a big operation so it is not super personal - I saw many drs other than Dr Chung during the stimulation phase ,and some were really brusque and cold. But I liked how organized the clinic was. It does feel like a factory but the good part of that is you never wait long and they know what they are doing. WHe I did see Dr Chung he was very warm and helpful. His nurses were great communicators.I'm very lucky to have found Dr Spandorfer. Before seeing him I was left wondering why we couldn't get pregnant, and what the next steps would be. Once we met with Dr Spandorfer there was a clear path, though of course it varied when needed. We always felt supported and knew that if there was a way to get pregnant, Dr Spandorfer was the one who could help us. While his bedside manner is not as warm as one might want, all of his other characteristics -- especially his knowledge of infertility -- more than made up for this. I would highly recommend him to anyone looking for a great RE with proven results. He was great. Really liked his personality and bedside manner. He was very personal and thoughtful. Unfortunately, my only criticism is that he is working within a very specific system and can't really experiment as much as we would have needed. In general, I really liked him though.He was very cold and very set in the ways of the clinic. There was no adjustment to our situation or when it wasn't working to change the methods. We did not have success with the Cornell process and there was no real effort to change it or adjust to our specific needs.This was a long time ago, but I clearly remember being treated with respect and kindness. All of Dr. Chung's decisions were intelligent, well thought out, and well explained. He's a consummate professional. We had been using another clinic where the superstar doctor was very casual and blase, and the office was un-professional and sloppy. The change to Dr. Chung was, in my opinion, the reason we were successful.  Dr Spandorfer is an amazing person. He is extremely knowledgeable, carrying, smart and respectful. Always answer all the questions. He takes initiative to provide customized care. He tried standardized protocol with me then suggested an alternative. It worked much better than the first one. He was great, I got the results I wanted! He probably could have been warmer but he was very nice and I went to him because he was recommended by my ob so it was more important to me to be going to a great dr than to have a dr who was my friendDr. Pereira was recommended by a friend who got pregnant by doing an IUI. I am now pregnant thanks to Dr. Pereira. 
His monitoring hours worked perfectly with my schedule. He is very knowledgeable and clear when explaining the next steps. I spoke to Dr. Spandorfer once on the phone and I saw him twice (once on the day of the egg harvest and the day of the transfer), otherwise I saw other doctors at Cornell.  Spandorfer was very nice and had a great bedside manner. But if it had been my first IVF instead of my fourth, I probably would have been upset that I almost never saw him but it was fine because it was my fourth time.  Dr. Reichman is not the most outwardly warm doctor; however, he takes the time to get to know each patient and develop a relationship with them.  I always trusted that he had my best interests at heart and that he was invested in my success.The place is very organized to treat so many people and give the highest care possible, so it could feel like you are just a number but I always knew Dr Goldschlag was monitoring my progress even if I didn’t always see him at appointments. I did not get to see Dr. Kligman every time during my monitoring.  so when i have questions for him and couldn't see him in person, he would always call you back with phone call on the same day. that is helpful to me.She's a doctor who is excellent at her job. She gets results. Not overly familiar, not cold, she has treated me like an adult, and without judgement. Something that is important for a potential single mother.Very smart, experienced, competent; knows the math, risks, and what's happening in the research and the space. A bit over-efficient at times and sometimes a bit too ""trust me I'm a doctor""- like. Took extra time to deal with us and make himself available after hours, as well as do specific procedures himself.I felt dismissed and disrespected. He is threatened easily if you ask questions and becomes very irritated and defensive. I don’t know how he is still practicing. I felt like it was 1950 and I had no voice under his care. He’s great and we’ve had a good experience with him. He’s offered solutions and adjusted the course of treatment as we’ve gone along the ways He’s also very responsive.The rest of clinic could be better. There were some mishaps and mixups with communication between ththe two offices. Open, honest, practical, compassionate. Remarkably improved experience over 2 prior NY clinics. Organized office, competent staff. Dr. Spandorfer is skilled, experienced. Open to all questions and suggestions but remains evidence-based and firm regarding recommended treatment options. Open to any non-harmful adjunctive interventions.Dr.Pfeifer did every ultrasound during IVF and my egg retrieval. While she has 100s of patients, I always felt like her only one. She explained everything in detail and always made me feel educated and comfortable every step of the process.Dr. Reichman knows the subject well.  He was very courteous.  He starts seeing the patients from 6:45AM.  So, we could easily schedule appointments before our office hours.  We recommend him to everyone.I liked Dr. Spandorfer. He was just the right amount of involved. The only thing that bugged me was that it was hard to speak directly with him, unless you were at the clinic. I wasn't given an email address and when I left messages, it took a while for a return phone call. I would have liked to have been able to email questions. He was sympathetic when I had a miscarriage and did a lot of follow up because I had complications.I loved Dr. spandorfer, he was responsive, compassionate and candid.   he is not a warm fuzzy, but he is honest and gave real advice.  he told us the true stats on when we should keep going or move on.  Wonderful doctor who is calm and clearly articulates the issues and how he plans to address them. After set backs, we discussed how I was feeling emotionally and physically (and financially) and that was part of the equation of how we were to move forward with my plan. Hey-Joo is an excellent communicator. She is positive, and energetic but also calming and empathetic. Hey-Joo was warm, friendly, funny, caring and supportive. I felt like she was my greatest advocate. She kept my spirits high but was also realistic. She knew when to be sensitive of my feelings and when to be real and honest. I completely trusted her and felt very taken care of.  I highly recommend Hey-Joo to others. I really liked dr 4. Spandorfer.  He was honest and warm.  When I had a miscarriage or failed cycle he always called me.  He did a great job.  We always got a great number of embryos.  We had poor egg quality and he was very kind and straightforward about pushing us towards donor eggs.  He was really thoughtful, considerate and kind.  He is a straight shooter and tells it like it is.  He is very busy though and often times it could be hard to get in touch with him.  He will eventually return calls but I often felt like there was not a ton of time spent analyzing my difficult case.Dr Chung gave me my miracle baby., after my last docotor told me to use donor eggs. He looked at my file after our first cycle With him was a complete failure and told me he would not give up on me. He is truly what all doctors should be and I am forever grateful for him.Dr. Reichman cares deeply about his patients and takes time to learn about their goals and create a tailored fertility program. He's very prompt to appointments and able to be flexible depending on patient needs and unexpected happenings during a cycle.I felt that he had compassion,  but most importantly he knew what he was doing. After first transfer he saw that my embryos were not strong so he was pretty adamant that I do genetic testing in order to find the right embryo. He was so right on that I needed to do this because out of all the embryos I only had 1 that was genetically good. Dr. Kang was extremely compassionate and was the perfect physician for me as she explained all the details but did so in a very sensitive manner.  Her demeanor and confidence made me trust her completely.  She didn't want to be too aggressive in my initial treatments so it took me a few months to get pregnant but I appreciated that she only gave us the treatment plan that she thought was absolutely critical.Pak Chung is a phenomenal reproductive endocrinologist.  He has a warm bedside manner but is also very scientific and thorough in explaining the details of the procedures and results to his patients.  When working with him you know you are in the best hands you could possibly be in.  He is a wonderful combination of brilliant and relatable. I can't say enough good things about Cornell.  I always felt that I had received amazing care. Every doctor was compassionate and up-to-date on  where I was in the fertility process. The nurses were also wonderful and always great with getting back to me when I had any questions.Dr.Reichman is extremely knowledgeable and professional.
He is very straightforward and compassionate at the same time.
I felt he provided me with the best options during the treatments and he made sure I was fully informed at every step of the process.
I have seen him during all the appointments and I never felt he was rushed.
Very compassionate and honest. Always available by email. Kind and never rushed. Plenty of hope. Kindness above all. Changed protocols. Gave me hope. Saw him at almost every appointment. Was available by phone. He seemed like the only doctor who wanted me to get pregnant.  He took time to read my records, redid tests that were not conclusive, explained everything to me.  He made suggestions and recommendations and ultimately let me make the decision. He was very direct and caring at the same time. He helped me to move on to surrogacy when it was appropriate. He was very available when I had mid second trimester losses. He always made me feel hopefulDr. Schattman treated me with respect and kindness. He made sure to scan me every morning as he knew I was Only there for him. He went ahead and was there for both my transfer and retrieval . My only issue was that he did not take my complaints of pelvic pain seriously and I need to have surgery with my gynecologist months after my chemical pregnancy  He's very knowledgeable and I can tell he knows his stuff. As he is also on a times website of affiliated doctors. However yea I do just feel like a number overtime and I don't really leave the office always understanding my case of pcos. He always says things look good and it's sorta fake sounding and illogical like I'm ttc for over a yr and half and I can multiple cysts on ovaries so how does everything ""look good"". Wish he'd elaborate moreHard to talk to but extremely smart. I did not like him.  He was condescending and always in a rush.  When i went in for my first sonogram post positive pregnancy test and he didn't see what he was expecting to see, he was insensitive and brief and left the room abruptly.  We felt helpless and abandoned and I switched doctors immediately.excellentHe is wonderful but we never saw him.  I did refer a friend to him before I went, she went for 2 cycles and had great success. All-in he got 30k btwn me and my referrals. Would have appreciated some direct attentionDr. Kligman is an expert in fertility.  He quickly assessed by situation and created a game plan for my treatment.  When each of the various methods we tried didn't work, he quickly made changes to my treatments and protocols to ultimately find a successful route.  You can't expect things to happen overnight but he will not give up until he is able to help! I couldn't say enough about him.  He was wonderful.  Caring, kind, intelligent, willing to listen to me, calmed my fears, set reasonable expectations, explored different paths when things didn't work, etc.Dr. Reichman is a kind and passionate doctor. He makes sure to listen to what you have to say and will take the time to explain any concerns you may have. He is very monotone and not that warmest doctor but I am very happy with him overall.Only downside is how long it takes to see her. She's really busy. Dr Chung was very knowledgable.  He was very optimistic and approachable.  Even after failed cycles, he remained positive which was very reassuring.Although I didn't get pregnant with Dr. Davis, I had a great experience with him. Highly recommended.  She was always there for us.   She cared.She was warm, compassionate and understanding yet blunt and informative.Cares a lot but is not nurturing in personality. I was touched that he made sure to do all of my transfers after the first one he did which resulted in my first pregnancy. Zzzxxxxxxxxxzxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxcccccccccccccccccccccccccccvvvvvvvvvat the time (2002-2003) he had a lot of experience with the over 40 crowd. I got pregnant on my fourth cycle ( third at Cornell, using on own eggs. I delivered my son one month after my 43rd birthday.Dr. Pfeifer sticks to facts and research in giving you information to make decisions. Perhaps she leans more on experience in developing treatment plans as she is a professional with many years under her belt, but she doesn’t leave it to the inexperienced patient to make decisions based on “feeling”. I also appreciated that she was very knowledgeable about how fertility medication may affect people with an autoimmune disease I have. I already knew this information but asked anyway and was impressed that she could state specific studies that were done on this and their findings. We'll defiantly be returning to Dr. Pereira for baby 2!!  We were recommended to Dr. Pereira by one of our close friends. Who also had great results. We had such an amazing & successful experience. He's so incredibly brilliant and caring. It's truly amazing how accurate he was with everything. I can not recommend him enough!! Dr. Nigel Pereira is the most brilliant, compassionate, professional and accessible physician my husband or I has ever seen. He and his staff were always accessible, calling immediately after each and every test. Dr. Pereira helped us get pregnant the first cycle he treated us. When we miscarried, after having ""graduated"" from Dr. Pereira's care, he called us immediately, on the weekend, from his vacation to review possible causes, next steps and to extend his sympathies. I have an auto-immune disease and have an intimate relationship with hospitals and physicians--never have I met anyone as caring or capable as Dr. Nigel Pereira. Dr. Pereira is brilliantly smart, empathetic, humble, dedicated, friendly and frankly, all around spectacular.  He is passionately interested in his patients treatment, works diligently to find solutions and provide individualized care/protocol.  He has the most outstanding combination of intellectual intelligence with emotional intelligence which I believe enables successful and assuring outcomes. Dr. Pereira always took time to educate us on the process so we could make smart decision for ourselves with his guidance and support each step of the way.  He spent hours answering my questions directly, realistic and honestly (never felt like I was getting fluffy answers) while still maintaining outstanding bedside manner, optimism and transparency.  Dr. Melnick made me feel comfortable from my very first appointment which was a consultation and physical examination. It was because of my interactions with her that I decided to stay with Weill Cornell for my IVF. Since my first visit to present, she has consistently answered all questions as quickly as she could and has taken the time to explain everything and also welcome more questions. The IVF world can be a cold and fast-paced one and extremely overwhelming. Dr. Melnick's expertise and personality is the combination that I needed to have the courage and assurance needed to keep moving forward with the process with hope and good presence of mind.Dr. G is a good physician. Weill Cornell is another story.  I work as a complementary healthcare practitioner, treating a lot of fertility patients, so I have seen firsthand how bad some physicians are. I have only had good experiences so far. Dr Davis is incredibly knowledgeable. He’s a very experienced doctor and knows what he is doing. He’s also great in explaining all issues - you need to pay attention not to loose anything, but you will learn so much from him. I also thought he was very compassionate during the treatment, but he’s realistic and show great ability to connect with patientsDr Rosenwaks explained everything & he made me feel better when I got emotional.  He’s not all smiles & warm & fuzzy.  I had Doctors like that but I didn’t get pregnant.  Dr Rosenwaks just makes sure that you get pregnant.  He’s very knowledgeable & is highly competent in every aspect or reproductive medicine. After seeing all the doctors at Weill Cornell, I can honestly say I am confident David Reichman was the right doctor for me. Dr Reichman is honest, scientific, and truly real about his treatment plans, expected outcomes, and preparation requirements needed to be successful, He is data-driven, while being empathetic and compassionate. I have full confidence in his knowledge and expertise. He is always referencing cutting edge procedures and knows the research behind all of his treatment plans, I have  become smarter being his patient and always have my questions ready because I truly enjoy learning from him through this difficult process. I had seen two other doctors before I met with Dr Pereira. He was definitely my, “third times a charm.” I am One that avoids going to doctors because of my anxiety and trust issues but I knew I needed help. Dr Pereira took his time and explained everything to me and listened to what I wanted as well.  We decided together on what steps I would take. He’s also so kind and caring.  I was very upset and worried when I first started the whole process but he made me feel like everything will be OK and I knew I was in good hands. It was crazy how I was not even worried anymore. Whenever I emailed him regarding any questions I had, he got back to me so quickly no matter what time it was. I cannot recommend him enough. He is just the most amazing doctor with such a big heart. Dr. Pereira went out of his way on multiple occasions to check on me to see how I was doing after my miscarriage. He fully explained every step of the way and made sure I understood what the options were at each point. He was kind and gentle but also rational and clear with his candid explanations. He was extremely responsive. Dr. Pereira is truly a great doctor. I was a little sad to have graduated from his care, other fertility doctors could really take example of his bedside manner. When we first met with Dr. Pereira for our first consultation, he was extremely compassionate and patient while he listened to our experience, and our first pregnancy ending in miscarriage and the horrid experience at our prior fertility clinic in midtown, I didn't get into great lengths with the entire experience with Dr. Pereira, but my husband and I definitely felt like a number versus how Dr. Pereira immediately treated us like human individuals and that it is ok to show sadness and grief and how everyone handles miscarriages differently. Dr. Pereira really gave us a new sense of trust in doctors, and his patience and knowledge is invaluable to our entire experience with him. We can't thank Dr. Pereira enough just for how he treated us, nevermind the professional care. Thank You.The doctor is very professional, well knowledgeable. He explained very well the procedure and steps, and provide his recomendation based on his expertise. He is friendly and respectful always gree me by my name in a polite caring and warm smile. Dr. Elias told me everything I needed to know before my next surgery. We also went over post OP options. He was very clear throughout every step. He calmed my fears. He allows me to express my fears without feeling like just a number.Dealing with infertility has been a real struggle for me. One thing that helps me push forward is having complete confidence in Dr. Elias. He takes the time to listen and answer my questions. You can tell that he is knowledgeable and up to date with current research when speaking with him. I had a great experience with Dr. Melnick. She is a great doctor who is honest and kind. She always kept me in the loop and explained everything thoroughly. She helped my partner and I to make fully informed decisions along the way. I would recommend her to anyone! He analyzed our situation and explained what to do concisely. He always encouraged us and proposed several solutions. We didn’t give up since he gave us hope based on his proper analysis.(he also said if we need to give up, he would let us know to be honest) The doctor was nice but after going to my second and current fertility clinic I wouldn't go back to Dr. Elias or recommend him. Very uncomfortable practice. I don't have much else to say but need to hit 200 characters. Dr. Kang made me feel unbelievably comfortable and secure throughout the entire process.  She possesses every possible characteristic one could ask for in a doctor!  I never felt like a number and her attention to detail goes above and beyond.  I HIGHLY recommend her!Dr. Reichman is warm yet professional. He takes his time to listen and to ask questions. He is direct in his communicating and doesn't sugarcoat anything, but is always empathetic. He is systematic in his work and tailors the treatment to the patients situation and needs. It is definitely not a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach. He is solution-oriented and comes up with new strategies and options when something doesn't work. He is the best doctor I have ever been treated by, all categories.As many times as I called she was right there with us. She is sensitive to our needs and I feel her compassion in each visit. We have been working with her for two years and I would recommend her to anyone. Dr. Kang always took the time to listen to my questions and concerns.  She is the second IVF physician I have seen and is by far a great example of how physicians should treat patients during this difficult process.  She was very patient and caring with me.I always felt that DR Reichman had our best interests at heart; both emotionally and physically. He was always extremely careful to tell you exactly what was happening. He always direct with what he saw happening which is vital during this processes. By nature there will be a lot of ups and downs. Trying to read into what a doctor is saying will only make the process more torturous. Positive, humorous, real and trustworthy! Never made me feel like we met our final straw in our ability to conceive. Even when defeated, dr. Schattman was encouraging in that he created plans, with his colleagues, in a non hasty manner.  He took the time to look at our history, our path and what can be changed to give us the success we wanted! Going to see Dr Melnick was like going to see a friend. A real partner in the whole process. I never felt like just another patient - she really cares and wants to make sure I am comfortable through the whole process.Dr. Kang is well experienced, candid, kind and approachable. I had a positive  experience and appreciate how Dr Kang spoke to me with positive energy. Questions were always answered in a timely fashion and she could sense when I was overwhelmed. I have recommended him to all of my friends- he may not be as warm and fuzzy as some doctors but gets results. Won’t “hold your hand” but I don’t think that’s necessary. He is compassionate in an understated way.As me being the patient doctor kligman was very nice respectful and make sure I understand everything I needed to know. He explained that not every cycle would be same and everytime I come to his office I would only see him. I don’t think he paid enough attention to my individual case and what could have been causing my infertility. My treatment was not customized. It was generally very difficult to get in touch with the doctor as well as the nurses. Dr. Pereira was a wonderful resource throughout my journey to get pregnant. He is knowledgeable, intelligent, and experienced and maybe most important, he is a very good communicator and listener. In my first visit, which was rather overwhelming as I was diagnosed with PCOS (which I was utterly clueless about), he went above and beyond to explain the exact science of the disorder as well as how it would impact me and my treatment options. I left feeling 100% comfortable that I was in good hands. Over the course of the next few months, he worked with me respectfully and diligently to find the right treatment, and when we had obstacles in the path, he was understanding and caring about the stress they caused. We had numerous visits to our previous fertility clinic and were trying for 1 and half year before we visited Dr Pereira. Our first 3 IUI cycles with the previous clinic did not lead to desired results and we were also not happy in the way we were treated just like a number. A job change prompted us to change locations and also  our clinic and now looking back I am so glad that happened. During our first visit we explained our previous history of a chemical pregnancy and a miscarriage and were concerned that there was a problem with me holding onto pregnancies. Dr. Pereira was quick to explain that was not the case and that it is common for a single miscarriage to happen. Post minor hiccups with the billing department we were then stuck by our insurance not covering for our IUI's but just TI (Timed Intercourse) cycles before we could graduate to IVF. Dr Pereira again also discussed the denial of the IUI authorization with the insurance. Once we were sure that IUI's wont be covered we started with the TI cycles and the first 2 cycles were negative and I was starting to lose hope but Dr Pererira assured that it was just a matter of time. Luckily, we were able to get a positive result on the 3rd round of treatment and I am currently at 13 weeks. During our visits to the clinic Dr Pereira showed warmth and excellent bedside manners and was very sensitive when relaying messages of failure during the first 2 attempts. He was always available over email to answer any queries or concerns that we had and would always reply within few hours even over the weekend. Overall I strongly vouch for Dr. Pererira and was sad to leave his office when we graduated at 10 weeks to our OB-GYN. Dr. Reichman is a dedicated, engaged and determined fertility doctor. He made it clear from day one that ours would be an uphill battle and that he would be with us every step of the way. He outlined our challenges, was very candid about success rates, and asked thoughtful questions to guide us toward an action plan. Each visit from that point forward involved conversations about our progress as well as strategizing our next steps. Dr. Reichman's feedback and intuition helped us to make difficult decisions about the genetic testing of embryos, fresh versus frozen transfers, and whether to commit to additional cycles to increases our odds. 

Dr. Reichman's professionalism is unparalleled. He is quick to address inquiries via email and he makes sure his nurses have everything they need to fully support patients. Thankfully, while skilled, experienced and confident, he is never arrogant or smug, and he doesn't hesitate to consult colleagues for additional opinions. For example, my sonogram once revealed something that caused Dr. Reichman to question the need for a medical procedure that would have delayed our cycle (but if necessary, we wouldn't have hesitated to do). After reviewing past cases and seeking counsel from a trusted colleague, he decided to forego the procedure and proceed as planned. We greatly appreciated the time he took to truly consider all the factors and arrive at a decision we all trusted as the right one. 

Through it all, Dr. Reichman was honest, pensive, warm, empathetic and supportive. And he even managed to infuse a bit of humor into things at just the right moments. IVF is an emotionally and physically trying process. Being in Dr. Reichman's care made the difficult times more bearable and the good times even sweeter. We are currently pregnant and are forever grateful to Dr. Reichman and his stellar team for their strong work and endless support. 



I had a wonderful experience with Dr. Pereira and his team.  His bedside manner and demeanor are lovely, and he intently listens to and answers all questions - no matter how silly or insignificant they might seem!  He is able deliver information clearly, kindly, and honestly - even when it's news that you might not necessarily want to hear.  He is able to manage a mixture of realism and optimism that is comforting and trustworthy.  I initially went to him after 2 chemical pregnancies and 5 months of trying.  After a battery of fertility tests, everything looked fine so we assumed it was likely the fact that I'm 39 years old that was affecting the viability of the pregnancies.  On our second round of Letrozole, Dr. Pereira noticed something didn't look right on my ultrasound and presumed I had a uterine polyp.  I ended up having another chemical pregnancy that cycle, and he and his team were very kind as my husband and I dealt with another disappointment.  However, he and his team acted fast, and I was able to schedule the procedure to remove the polyp within weeks.  Low and behold, I got pregnant just 6 weeks later and am now 12 weeks along.  I highly recommend Dr. Pereira and his team!I chose Dr Pereira because he came highly recommended and his reviews on Fertility IQ were the strongest. Rightly so, he's very knowledgeable and thorough with explaining what a lot of women don't know about when it comes to fertility and what exactly the hormones are doing. I appreciated that he took the time to explain the science behind it. Dr Pereira is a very popular and busy doctor, but I never really felt rushed in my appointments with him. He even remembered that we like the same bands/music, and was always so nice to my husband. I honestly have no negative feedback on Dr Pereira, he is the best fertility doctor in NYC hands down! Dr. Reichman is the best doctor I have ever had. He got to know us very well, knew our case by heart and was very focused and invested. Our case was a bit of a mystery, but he never gave up and figured it out. He was very encouraging throughout the entire journey, even through the downs he was sure we will end up with healthy pregnancy. He is direct and says things as they are, which is also my style so it was greatly appreciated. He was very compassionate when we had a loss, but was also encouraging and helped us move forward quickly, discussing with us plan of attack on a Sunday night at his personal time. Dr. Reichman is pretty quick responder through email. In downtown, Dr. Reichman did my ultrasounds every time, he is almost never absent. Our fertility journey began in November 2017 through March 2019. We saw Dr. David Reichman in June of 2018 after our 3rd miscarriage.  We were able to successfully have our daughter in 2016 naturally with ease (we got pregnant very quickly).  So when we tried for another child it was surprising and shocking when we were not able to, each miscarriage was extremely difficult for us.  From the first meeting with Dr. Reichman, he laid out a path for us to figure out what was going on. Long story short-I was diagnosed with ""secondary infertility"" due to scar tissue in my uterus from a D&C procedure (after 1st miscarriage in 2017) and a condition called Asherman's syndrome (as a result of the D&C).  Dr. Reichman performed a hysteroscopy to remove the scar tissue successfully and guided us throughout the IVF procedure.  He is a phenomenal doctor, smart and precise.  I felt very safe and trusted him 100% with good reason - he is great.  We decided to do ICSI with PGT due to me being a carrier for Fabry's disease and later frozen embryo transplant using 5 day old embryo.  Because of his careful guidance and treatment we were able to successfully get pregnant after the very 1st transfer (which we did in early March 2019). Our family is blessed and we are so thankful and forever grateful to Dr. Reichman and the entire staff at Weill Cornell CRM - as just few short weeks ago we welcomed a healthy baby boy into our family.  Our family feels complete and we would not have been able to do this without the assistance and help of Dr. Reichman.  We are forever grateful and thankful for his expert care and have nothing but respect and love for him! I am utterly grateful and privileged to have had Dr. Pereira as my doctor. It is because of Dr. Pereira that I am expecting and he made the emotional process of treating infertility so much easier. Dr. Pereira always listened to my concerns, explained procedures fully, and was always accessible if I had questions or concerns. I don't know many doctors who are not only willing to give out their email but responded so quickly and compassionately. 

I can't say enough positive things about Dr. Pereira or his staff.   Dr. Pereira is a special doctor, and one of the rare ones whose bedside manner equally parallels his incredible expertise.   I have never felt so important and cared for as a patient, and I think Dr. Pereira's regular communication and quick responses to my inquiries, has a lot to do with it.  During my time as Dr. Pereira's patient, I underwent emergency surgery for ovarian torsion. Dr. Pereira did not skip a beat making sure I was properly cared from the initial testing, to understanding my options, to answering my call at the crack of dawn when I knew I was in need of emergency surgery.  I felt really lucky to have a gynecological surgeon, who was also a fertility specialist, in charge of my care, because I knew he would ensure my fertility future was well taken care of.  He really is the best doctor, and it was bittersweet 'graduating' from his practice. Can not recommend him enough.  Dr Pereira  took the time to review my history thoroughly and took the time to answer all my questions. He was the only person I saw for checkups and he was able to switch things around to do my retrieval as well. He was always encouraging and always followed up. If I had any concerns he saw me the same day or next day. I cannot recommend him enough! He is compassionate and really cares about his patients!As previously mentioned, Dr Pereira always made me feel incredibly cared for. He always made time to explain everything and answer my questions thoroughly - no appointment ever felt rushed and I always felt like a priority of his.From the first consultation we had with Dr Pereira, we felt looked after, supported and informed. Although our journey was much harder than we expected he worked so tirelessly to support us with our desire to have a second baby. We believe we had immunology issues and for some unexplained reason the progesterone was not taking. He kept adjusting our treatment, whilst acting in the most compassionate way. In the end we supported our successful transfer with immunology meds prescribed by our London Dr. I will never forget the day he called me with our first beta test results. It had been just over a full year we had been in his care and I know he was with us every step of the way, it was incredibly emotional. Having experienced very early losses he propped us up through the first weeks as I was so fragile and scared. I cannot thank him enough for all his support. We are eternally grateful.My experience with Dr. Reichman was an absolute pleasure from start to finish.  His confidence gave me strength.  He is extremely knowledgeable in his field of medicine.  He is prompt and thorough, yet he takes his time to make sure that you understand every aspect of the situation.  He is friendly and caring.  Excellent bedside manner.  Gentle during procedures.  One of the best medical professionals I have ever dealt with.  I trust him with my health 100% and would recommend anyone I care about to him.  He is absolutely amazing.  He is an excellent and extremely knowledgable medical professional. His manner is friendly but professional, and he is even-keeled and confident in his expertise. His interactions are straightforward and matter-of-fact with enugh warmth and compassion for the experience. I've always felt quite comfortable wit Dr. Reichman. 
However, morning monitoring hours are not the best time to ask Dr. Reichman detailed questions. He will answer them albeit slightly more brusquely than when you meet with him for a consultation or other appointments. He's very responsive over email. He is, I would say, mostly focused on the fertility treatment as a direct option; he is less concerned with or focused on addressing underlying issues of infertility. He is mission-driven and mission-focused. If you want a more holistic approach (that takes your body's fertility and health into more detailed consideration), Dr. Reichman may not be your first choice. He may be taking these factors into careful consideration, but that wasn't necessarily clearly communicated during my IUI and IVF processes. Overall, I've always trusted his advice, and he has always encouraged me to ask any questions or share any concerns.Refer to my earlier note - just incredible. Honestly I can't find one area for improvement. It was such a pleasure which is a weird thing to say about Fertility Treatments. I have been recommending him to anyone that will listen. His bedside manner is honest and very dedicated about communicating the right things of whats going on and to have these expectations. He's very informative yet warm. I completely trusted his suggestions and what percentages would occur and how to proceed with treatment. He would never take unnecessary risks and made sure to have the best success rate.I enjoyed every visit.  It didn't feel clinical - i felt like each time I got new facts and was more and more empowered about my body.  Couldn't be more grateful to have found him. 

I was quite sad that my journey with Dr.  Pereira had to end at nine weeks.  I felt so comfortable with him that i wished he could be part of my entire journey.We couldn't have asked for a better experience with Dr. Reichman. It was a difficult and long journey and we felt we were in the best hands the entire time. He is extremely knowledgable and we trusted him completely. He is also warm, funny, and caring, and made the experience of being in the office almost every morning as pleasant as possibleI loved Dr. Reichman. He was always present at every monitoring appointment and always new who I was. He was empathetic but also direct in his advice. His confidence was infectious. I had two other doctors at two other clinics and no one compared. I have nothing but good things to say about Dr. Pereira.  He was incredibly professional, knowledgeable and empathetic.  I always felt like I could ask him any question and he would give me a straight answer.  When there were options, i always understood the pros/cons and risks. Dr. Pereira took the time to explain everything to us and allowed us the time to ask him every question.  He was also very responsive to emails and calls.  He would often call himself to give results.  He reassured us at a time that was precarious and sensitive and continued to support us throughout our time with him. Dr. Reichman is one of the best doctors out there. He is very knowledgeable, caring and trustworthy. We transferred from RMA to Cornell last fall and are almost six months pregnant with our first. He was able to diagnois us on our first appointment and gave us a realistic plan. We are very grateful and lucky to have found him. We found Dr. Pereira after reading lots of reviews online. From the outset he gave us a detailed explanation of our options and counseled us through the process. After almost 3.5 years of trying to conceive naturally with his help we were able to get pregnant. Thank you Dr. Pereira. I could not recommend Dr Pereira highly enough. I am 43 years old and went to see Dr Pereira for guidance on how to proceed with a pregnancy at this age, without knowing whether I would encounter fertility or other issues. Dr Periera was incredibly kind, patient and comprehensive in his advice. There was never any pressure to go down any particular path of fertility treatment, rather he laid out very carefully all of the information and my options.  Dr Pereira was extremely attentive and treated each appointment in a very personal and professional manner.  My husband was made to feel very comfortable as well, and felt very much involved in the process. Dr Periera is extremely responsive by email and we were made to feel very much at ease in asking any questions at any time. On my first appointment, Dr Periera told me that he treated each of his patients like family, and I truly felt that to be the case.
In the end, we were very fortunate to fall pregnant naturally and continued to be under Dr Pereira's care for only a short period while he looked after our pregnancy during the high risk first trimester, but in the future if we need to address fertility issues for another pregnancy, I would absolutely return to see Dr Pereira. 
I was amazed at how much information the monitoring could provide.  The office runs extremely efficiently and you are able to have an early appointment so as not to disrupt the work day.  Each ultrasound and blood drawing were quick and efficientWe are forever grateful to the wonderful Dr. Pereira!  We came to him after switching from a different clinic in NJ where we had two failed IVF cycles.  Dr. Pereira immediately noticed that our medicine dosages had been completely incorrect, along with incorrect timing of trigger shot resulting in poor quality eggs.  Not only did Dr. P reinstate our hope in ever having children, but he thought that we should give an IUI a chance because our original diagnosis of poor morphology was potentially not as bad as initially thought.  Dr. P’s instinct was spot on because our very first IUI with him worked!  Aside from our miracle we felt confident that he is a doctor who would always know what to do next when unexpected outcomes come up, and his incredible knowledge and confidence was obvious.  Not to mention, he is an all-around awesome guy (and funny too)!  We will definitely be back to him (if we need) for baby number 2 and HIGHLY recommend him to anyone struggling with incompetent doctors and a complex fertility case.Dr. Pereira is simply amazing, as a doctor & a human. He is one of the most compassionate and professional doctors i have ever worked with and has amazing bedside manner. Not only did he answer all of my questions via email, phone and at the office, but every appointment was thoughtful and considerate. I never felt rushed or as if my questions were unnecessary. Furthermore, his care was extremely on-point, professional and helpful in every way. I was sad to ""graduate"" from his care after i got pregnant and wish that he could have been my doctor throughout my pregnancy. 
Dr. Pereira was just a lovely person from the moment I first met him in consultation all the way through. He was knowledgeable and did an excellent job of explaining everything to me, and making sure I understood and that he wasn't going to fast. He was easy to reach and always returned calls/emails promptly. He was positive and compassionate in every interaction. I couldn't think of enough good things to say about him.Dr. Pereira is a wonderful person and a very professional doctor with a lot of experience, patience, and knowledge in his field. He has explained the entire fertility treatments to us from the beginning in a very graphical and didactical way, so we could choose in every stage of the process what options will fit better to our needs. He always had an answer to our problems and a clear solution for the next steps.  I suffered from strong and anonymous pain in my uterus and abdomen area for more than four years. I went to many doctors as I can and the best of them back in my country, no one gave me a clue or a correct answer  about my medical issue. I even had wrongly MRI diagnosis and unsuccessful laparoscopy. When I came here to visit Dr. Elias he explained for me the expected complications which i might have. All his assumptions were correct and all my procedures with him were successful. After waiting for more than 4 yrs to get pregnant and with all the unsuccessful fertility cycles i had before consulting him. Here i am with my first successful egg retrieval, embryo freezing, and embryo transfer, and a positive pregnancy. Although am still suffering from the microscopic endometriosis surrounding my pelvic and which nothing can be done to it, am very grateful and thankful to Dr. Elias cause he really tried his best to help me with my sickness and my  infertility issue. Thank you Dr., you’re the best !  I have recommended Dr. Pereira to my friends. One doctor friend of mine went through egg freezing with Dr. Pereira, and she described her experience as ""outstanding."" I too felt that way about Dr. Pereira. He is patient, personable and a straight-up excellent doctor. He is always aware of the facts of my case and presents the news to me in the best way possible. So I felt like I was in great-hands. I trusted him completely. Also I got pregnant.Dr. Pereira was extremely thoughtful and thorough in explaining everything, drawing diagrams to give me visuals, and outlining the various treatment options. He was super accessible and responsive to any questions I had. I had such an amazing experience with Dr. Pereira and would refer him to anyone! He is so kind, patient, and attentive. He replies to emails so promptly and made me feel comfortable and optimistic throughout this whole process. I worked with him for four months and I am now expecting!! I am beyond grateful and cannot say enough positive things about Dr. Pereira and my experience here. Many clinics will turn you down because they are only concerned about their appearance and numbers. The best is Weill Cornell. Dr.Elias is outstanding. He is honest, compassionate, non judgemental and brilliant. You are not just a number to him.Dr. Pereira is a wonderful doctor. I cannot recommend him more highly. He was transparent, informative, expert in his knowledge, and had amazing bedside manner. Both my husband and I felt so comfortable with him and trusted him with every step. We had great results and would absolutely go back to him if needed in the future. Dr. Reichman has a wonderful bedside manner and is truly a warm and kind individual, who cares about his work and patients.  And most importantly, he is a brilliant physician.  My husband and I felt like were in good hands as soon as we met him.  He took tons of time to fully explain the treatments to me--he treated me like an equal.  He was also very compassionate and responsive when I had concerns. While some of the nurses treated me like a number, Dr Pfeifer treated me like an individual. She was kind, straightforward, remembered my case,in most cases performed my sonograms and often called me with results (though not regular monitoring for IUI.)I went to a previous clinic where I met with a doctor, she wrote up a plan and than I never saw her again in that year I instead saw someone new every time I went. I switched to Cornell with Dr. Kang and was immediately happy that I did. She always made me feel so comfortable, and I saw her every appointment. If she couldn’t see me she made sure to ask me if I was ok seeing her colleague. She always gave me the time I needed and answered all my questions and never rushed me. Kept rooting for us during a cycle and always made us feel confident. I would highly recommend her to anyone and everyone! Less than 5 mins of consolation time face to face
He was reluctant to elaborate on the research or literature behind some of the results of my tests He always takes time to quietly explain what he wants to do and what the expected outcome is. He returns phone calls and I never felt rushed or pressured on the phone or in person. He was calming when I was scared that nothing was going to work.Treated me very much like a human, always remembered my case and treated me with kindness and compassion. With Dr. Chung, specifically, I always felt he tried very hard to be kind and to take the time to explain answers to questions.  Before both of my embryo transfers, he called me to discuss the embryo quality and to give me his recommendations.  When I had a number of questions, he suggested and did, in fact, meet with me in his office before each transfer to discuss details.  Undergoing treatment at Cornell generally, it's virtually impossible not to feel like a number, particularly during the monitoring portion and the retrieval at the hospital.  That said, Dr. Chung, at least for me, did his best given his caseload to provide individual care and attention.  It was not perfect but overall I felt more like a human than a number under his care.I spoke to Dr. Spandorfer once on the phone and I saw him twice (once on the day of the egg harvest and the day of the transfer), otherwise I saw other doctors at Cornell.  Spandorfer was very nice and had a great bedside manner. But if it had been my first IVF instead of my fourth, I probably would have been upset that i almost never saw him but it was fine because it was my fourth time.  However, I did not like dealing with Cornell.  The staff and some of the nurses are rude.  I was definitely just a number there.  And the wait times were absurdly long.  Dr. Reichman gets to know his patients as individuals.Great bedside manner. I was emotional in one of our conversations and I saw his eyes tear up with me as well. It meant a lot to know that he really connected with what I was going through.Dr.Pfeifer was very personable and always treated me like I was her only patient. She was never rushed and always spent lots of time with me. She and her team were very accessible to answer any calls or emails with questions.Very blunt. Difficult to get a hold of. After each negative beta, she never called first- I always had to get a hold of her. In the beginning she was fine, I had faith In Her but as I got to know her and after 4 failed attempts it seemed she gave up There are about 50 + patients in the waiting room whenever I come. And I'm only seen by the Dr minimally for the ultrasound and see him for less then 3 mins before and after combined great bedside manner
never felt rushed
really felt like he put thought and care into my plan and that he reviewed my records carefully every step along the way
he returned my phone calls very quickly and was very responsiveIt's a factory. Well-run, but a factory. Just feel like a pin cushion, throw your legs up, etc. not really their fault. Just a part of the process. Had very little interaction with Dr Davis himself.Dr. Reichman takes the time to get to know each of his patients. He shares the details of the chosen procedure and allows ample time to ask questions as well as provides his email for follow up questions. Dr. Pereira never rushed our appointments. He took time to ensure  asked all of my questions and felt comfortable with the responses. Dr. Pereira is the most compassionate and skilled doctor I have ever encountered. Ther fertility process is a roller coaster of emotions, but Dr. Pereira was there every step of the way explaining the process, answering questions, and offering support when needed.  In my case, I ended up needing surgery for endometriosis and he did a phenomenal job! You can't even notice the scar and he called the following day I returned home to make sure I was ok. Dr Pereira always encouraged me that this will work and that there’s no reason that I can’t get pregnant. He always responded to my emails the same day  and took all my concerns seriously. He was the only person I saw for all my checkups and the retrieval. Regardless of the many patients under his care, Dr Reichman remembered every detail of my case. He was always patient, answering all of my questions and calming my fears. He would consistently ask how my husband and I were doing, and was genuinly concerned about the emotional toll that my last miscarriage took on us (which was the result of natural conception, before we followed his recommendation to try IVF with genetically tested embryos).  In every interaction, it was obvious he cared about us as people and understood how trying this process can be. He also brought some much-needed levity that we always appreciated. 

Additionally, I can't say enough wonderful things about his office staff. The receptionists knew me by name and the nurses always greeted us with a smile no matter how early it was or how many patients were waiting. This makes all of the difference when you're starting so many of your days there.Dr Reichman is fantastic! He is kind and direct, and has a very warm demeanor and fun sense of humor. He clearly knows his stuff, and is quick to cite ""the literature"" and his own experience to answer all questions thoroughly. He is realistic yet encouraging, remembers details about your treatment and your life, and is always on your side.   The Tribeca office staff always remembered my name, and Dr. Reichman kept detailed notes on my case.I rate my experience is neutral. I like Dr. Schattman - he called us personally to discuss test results; he will also call back if I leave any messages. When you see him during monitoring, I don't feel rushed to ask him questions. However, the nurse communication/instructions could be better. They have different numbers for appointments, Main office # and nurses. For the nurses, there will not always be someone to pick up your call. You will have to leave a voice message. Although they will call you back before the end of the day when you leave a message, during this stressful journey I feel that having someone answer your phone call (may it be to relay a message) feels more ""human"" or less anxious provoking. Also, sometimes you also gets a voice message thru Dr. Schattman's office. When I leave a message, there is always that thought what if my message get deleted by mistake or the voice mail machine acts up. What now? Just my thought. In terms of their monitoring and appointments, they have a different section for both which I like. You don't feel the crowdedness in the morning during monitoring hours if you have an appointment with your doctor. We have done a couple of rounds of IVF retrievals with Dr. Kang. Prior to working with her, we were at RMA for 4 timed intercourse cycles, 3 IUIs, and 3 rounds of IVF. Dr. Kang started by treating us like a human at the beginning of the treatment. During the first cycle she stated that she thought our previous clinic overstimulated us and she was confident we could have more success with less aggressive medication regimens to stimulate eggs. The first cycle we had 4 embryos, but only 1 was viable on testing. The second cycle was cancelled. However, when we met with her for the next cycle to discuss the treatment plan, she was much colder. We stated that due to insurance, this is our last cycle and we want to optimize it. She looked at us and said, ""well we go into all of our treatment cycles thinking that."" When we asked for advice she wouldn't give us any suggestions and instead said, ""Well what do you want to do?"" I tried giving ideas based off of treatments I heard of through other support groups, online research, friends such as using Clomid on the male, procedures on myself, etc. She shook her head at all of them and said, ""what else are you thinking?"" So finally I responded, ""Well, you are the professional and this is your area of expertise, I'm only telling you the little research I've done, why don't you give us some ideas based on your knowledge?"" She was reluctant to come up with more suggestions but finally agreed to do a check up and after some time came up with a plan. I felt discouraged like I had to do the work on my own. Also felt as though she was not invested in our treatment after hearing we were running out of funds in our insurance plan.Cornell is a large cattle-call practice. I was monitored by a different attending almost every time. I didn't have a consistent nurse. I felt like my treatment plans were by the numbers, rather than tailored to me specifically, and I had real problems with pain management after egg retrieval. Over two years, they never even pronounced my name correctly. It wasn't great.Dr. Reichman is an extremely personable physician. He makes his patients feel like they matter. He takes time at every appointment with you, answers every question you have, and does not make you feel rushed. There were a couple times he suggested we set an appointment for a ""strategy meeting"" - his words - which we loved. He knows every detail about his patients. He remembers everything, even asking about how our trip to Chicago was when we had a follow-up appointment with him. 
His front-desk staff are the nicest and sweetest team members. They remember your name, ask how you're doing, and are always on top of everything.Dr. Reichman sees me every visit (unless it is a weekend or he is off for a holiday), which I appreciate. He always seems to consider my case and our next steps carefully. He doesn't have the warmest bedside manner, and doesn't seem to plug into the emotional toll this takes, but he does lay out the numbers and realities and stays positive. This is an extremely busy practice and while it is run as efficiently as possible, I found the experience to lack personal attention.  The front desk employees are not overly friendly.  The doctors handing ultrasounds for follicle growth always seemed to be in a rush and I would need to ask questions quickly to get an answer before they left the room for the next patient.  I never had a dedicated nurse assigned to my case while I was a patient.  Every call would be from a different individual which made it difficult if I had questions on my treatment....there was no consistency.  For my egg retrieval and transfer at the hospital, it was one big waiting game.  The room was full of patients and you were filed into the operating room one after the next.  The process was quite long and there was a lot of down time while waiting your turn.Dr. Davis is a very nice person. He was very patient and available on the phone and reassuring. I absolutely hated the clinic and that was the reason I only did 1 cycle there. But I liked him as a Dr and respected his approach. Dr. Rosenwaks is incredibly thorough and looks at every detail of your medical history and asks very specific  questions to best understand your case. His entire staff of colleagues, Nurse’s and administrators are truly the best and are a firsthand extension of his dedication and care. I felt like a human because she was willing to listen to me. She was very straightforward, but very kind. Right before my first IUI, she turned to me and actually said “let’s hope for a miracle.” I felt like that was more than a doctor had to say to a patient. She was kindly letting me know not to get my hopes up too high but was a small chance. This is more than any other doctor has said to me.Dr. Reichman knew my name, he addressed me personally and asked about my partner. Dr. Reichman made me feel so comfortable and welcome from our very first consultation visit. I am sure he could tell how nervous I was and he continuously put my mind at ease during the initial visit and throughout the entire time he treated me. He remembered details about my personal life as well as everything regarding my specific treatment. For monitoring appointments I saw him for almost every single visit aside from when I had to go to the UES on the weekends (which was only 2 times). Dr. Reichman knew my history (from another clinic) prior to my first appointment. He clearly had read the records I had sent to their office. In addition, throughout my care with Dr. Reichman he was very accommodating to my busy work schedule.Dr. Pereira went above and beyond to sit us down and walk us through how everything worked and all of my options for over an hour. He told us that while we were seeing him we were like family and gave us his email address. Any time we sent him any question he responded within a few hours (if not 20 minutes) even though he is extremely busy and no matter how silly the question may have been.   Dr Kang is absolutely amazing. She gave results and was straightforward about possible treatment plans and outcomes. She took time to answer questions and explain everything. Dr. S always took the time to answer my every question and his bedside manner was very kind.We cannot recommend Dr. Pereira enough!  Dr. Pereira is an excellent doctor and a wonderful human being. He goes out of his way to help you. Infertility is a tough journey and sometimes one needs reassurance from your doctor that things will be okay. Dr. Pereira was there for us whenever we needed help from him even at odd hours of the day. He has excellent bed side manners. We have not seen such humble, caring, intelligent and funny doctor before. He is subject matter expert and explains everything very clearly and encourages you to ask questions. His nurses and staff are very cheerful, helpful and always smiling. You never have to wait at his clinic and the staff is very efficient and punctual. We will always be grateful for his help and care during our infertility journey.Dr. Nigel Pereira treats all patients as if they are his family. This is a tough and emotional roller coaster but he is there every step of the way to ensure you have everything you need.  His bedside manner is also just what you need! 

 Just one of the many examples of how amazing, Dr. P is - He was away visiting a family member who was sick and still personally called me on a weekend to provide me with an update on my blood results.  Dr. Reichman is one of the kindest men. He is business like and efficient when that's called for and kind and gentle when that's appropriate. Empathy is neither faked nor absent. We made a special effort to be on hand for our transfer himself. As well, when we received bad news, the deep wellspring of his caring in unmistakable. I could not recommend him more highly. Dr Spandorfer initially was kind, extremely confident and really seem to know what he was talking about and the direction he wanted to go with my treatment. But when my first IVF with him failed he was a very different person. He was snappy and rude and unwilling to explain things to me especially when the second and different protocol didn't go well at all. Both Dr. Reichman and the staff at Weill Cornell were always kind and responsive. There was no time throughout my 5 IVF cycles that I felt unimportant or like just another patient to them. He was exceptionally patient and thorough, explaining the details of each process and answering all of our questions to the best of his ability. He also remembered particular details about us and our conversations with him over the years, which is remarkable considering how many patients he has!Cornell is a busy fertilitypractice, but never once did I feel like a number with Dr. Reichman. He is the perfectcombination of extremely kind and supportive while also being direct and honest.I’ve never had a doctor that I felt cared more about me than Dr. Reichman.We went after researching many. After meeting him my husband seemed to like him, so we stayed initially. He kinda laughed at us the first day  “why are you here? Did you know you are one of my youngest clients. This should be pretty easy.”  After my blood work was taken he then called us in. He said that my husbands numbers were “low that day but he may have masturbated to recently to the data so he is probably fine. The reason he sometimes could not ejaculate was most like because,” turns to me, without looking at me, “the stress that is placed on him.” 
“(My) numbers aren’t terrible but aren’t great as my AMH IS 0.55. So we are going to treat you like a much older woman well into her 40s.” All without eye contact. I had to pipe up and ask what amh meant again. We were pretty new to all of this. I really wasn’t sure. He reported that the number and quality of my eggs are very low and may not be that great. 
I’m still having a hard time forgetting. “Not terrible”. 
During appointments I could hardly hear what he was saying as he ultrasounded me. I would ask questions and get no answer. I would then email him still no answer, I would call his office and still no answers. Turns out he wrote in my chart patient has many questions one day. All of those questions were still unanswered. I finally got my husband to ask after realizing DrG rarely made eye contact with me. He finally answered my husband the same questions I had been asking a few cycles ago. 
After that I was done with him. I took a break, cleaned up my diet, got some other hormones checked and took supplements. Now we are meeting with a new doctor who already explained the most of that was a waste of time for me. It was very clear that Dr. Reichman felt personally invested in our efforts.  He was always responsive and we felt comfortable asking him whatever questions we had. He cared about us as people not just patients. We felt like we fully trusted him. Dr. Pereira always takes the time to genuinely say hello, asks how you are and you can tell he really cares. He is extremely responsive to emails and calls. Within 24 hours, if not sooner you hear from him. At initial consult he took to time to clearly explain reproduction, hormones, levels etc and what everything means and why it is important. He is very knowledgeable and competent. Dr. Elias takes time to get to know his patients and truly seems to understand the weight infertility bears on the person struggling.  He is compassionate and positive.  The facility was huge and I felt like another body there. It felt very clinical. At the time, I thought that was what I wanted and that being a part of a hospital clinic was the best route to go to ensure proper treatment and results.I can understand that someone going to him might feel like a number if everything looks normal and you proceed through monitoring to egg retrieval on a normal schedule.  Unfortunately, I did not respond to injections and so I received personal attention from the doctor.  He was very responsive by phone and then we scheduled an appointment to discuss an alternate protocol for when I try again.  He took the time to answer my questions and hear my frustrations and we're moving on together.  I'm still happy with his care.Weill Cornell is an incredibly busy fertility clinic so it can sometimes feel like a factory - mainly because of the sheer volume of women in the waiting with you and the fact that your doctor has to move quickly to other patients during morning monitoring appointments. Despite of that I felt like their care was excellent. Dr Reichman was always warm, efficient and honest. And I could email him directly, phone through to his staff or call an after hours service out of hours. At our consultation, Dr Pereira said that he treats his patients family and this was completely true in the one year that we worked with him to achieve pregnancy. He was kind, compassionate and went above and beyond to make sure all of our questions and concerns were addressed. Whether we wanted to discuss next steps in detail or test results, he would always welcome setting up additional appointments, responding quickly by email, or even calling us after hours / on the weekends to make sure we felt at ease.Dr Rosenwaks did not prescribe a cookie-cutter treatment for me ahead of time, he had me come in often for monitoring and then tailored the plan based on the daily monitoring results. Dr Reichman is incredible! He is both brilliant and kind and he really took the time to get to know us. It was very apparent that he was invested in our treatment and really wanted a positive outcome for us each step of the way. He went out of his way to come uptown to take care of our second transfer (on a day that he was not on call) and this transfer worked!While Dr. Rosenwaks is quite blunt and not very delicate, you can tell how much passion he has for his work and you as a patient. The first day we met him (initial consultation) he spent more than hour with my husband and me, discussing our history, personally doing a physical exam, and even took a photo of my husband and me (presumably to put faces to the names). We were very impressed with all of this. We were living abroad when we went through the treatment with Dr. Chung.  He makes an effort to go over the procedure and results with us either over the phone or in person when we were in NY.  However, he does seem to be in a rush all the time so better get your questions prepared ahead of time. Cornell is a busy practice and at times in the waiting room you feel like just a number. However, when interacting directly with Dr Reichman (and his team) I always felt like I was his only patient. Dr. Reichman gave me his full and complete attention and I felt like he genuinely cared about the outcome of this difficult process From my first appointment to my very last, Dr. Reichman made me feel like my case was a top priority. He always remembered my husband's name, what I did for work, and snippets from our previous conversations. He never compared me to other patients like some doctors do (which can make you feel like just another patient in a long line of patients), unless of course it was relevant or he was sharing an example. Dr. Reichman always responded to my questions honestly and openly. I knew he was working hard and following all of the right steps to get us where we wanted to be. I was warmly greeted by the doctor by name and handshake. He took over an
hour to explain all the details of my specific case and my available options. This doctor is not only interested in solving the problem, but to ensure the patient's level of comfort.Dr. Elias always made us feel comfortable.  My husband and I had multiple appointments with him because of my pre-ops for my fibroid surgeries, lap, etc.  He has great bed side manner, he's very kind, compassionate and extremely patient.  We always knew the success rates going in which helped when a treatment didn't work and he always took the time to thoroughly explain everything.Though Dr. Reichman is a busy doctor, I always felt like our questions were answered, issues clarified, etc. I was fairly active on email and he was super responsive. Dr. Melnick and her staff are all extremely warm, personal but also direct.  They care about their patients but also value honesty which meant a lot to me in the process.  I did understand what tests were being done, nor the outcome or meaning.
I would have liked to better understand what he/ we learned from each test and cycle. I often felt in the dark and my questions were answered but curtly and without elaboration. The ladies at the front desk always greeted me by name and were warm. Dr. Reichman always had a smile on his face and asked how I was. He responded quickly to my emails outside of office hours. He also always took what my husband and I wanted into consideration when presenting plans for next steps. I always felt like Dr. Reichman cared for me and was always rooting for the end result we wanted. With my complicated history, Dr. Davis clearly reviewed my extensive fertility records prior to our visit and was prepared to lay out a well formulated plan. He was honest but extremely informative.
Dr. Elias is great listener and thoughtful about his approach to treatment.  I had previously seen another RE that had discouraged me from IVF due to my age, and relative AMH and AFC; however, Dr. Elias had a positive outlook from the onset which made a huge impact in the process.  He assessed HSG records from specialists that I had seen previously and where others failed to, he educated me on the results with his recommendation.  He has a great bedside manner and is highly responsive to any concerns or questions.  At times it is easy to feel like a number when waiting in the Cornell waiting room, but now that they take appointments for monitoring it felt more human- I knew who I’d be seeing, and have a general sense of how long I’d be waiting. Additionally, once in the room with Dr Goldshlag I felt understood and well taken care of. Dr. Pereira is amazing in every way. He is knowledgeable, warm, and considerate. He has high standards, as does his staff. After I became pregnant, I did not want to leave his care because he was such a great doctor. The office is clean and beautiful and I never dreaded having to go see Dr. Pereira. If you want results and a doctor who is transparent and considerate, definitely go to Dr. Pereira.  Dr. Chung always treated me and my husband in a very warm, caring and genuine way.  Even though I wasn't able to conceive under his care (probably due to circumstances out of his control), I have zero doubt that him and his staff/team tried their absolute best to help us reach our goal of having a baby.  Dr. Chung always listened patiently to my long list of questions and never made me feel rushed or silly for asking them.  His assistants, Lily, Liliane, Phoebe and Alice were also always available to talk to me and assist me, and extremely helpful at all times.Her bedside manner was great. She was really good at listening to me and not telling me only what she knew. When i initially saw Dr Reichman in 2016 after 2 losses he was nothing short of amazing. He was kind, empathetic and really took the time to discuss treatment, calm anxiety and let you know he was there to support you. When I saw him again in 2018/2019 everything changed. He was blunt, short, easily annoyed and combative. I really felt like I was dealing with a completely different Doctor. He was no longer willing to try different things or think outside the box. It was very his way or the highway. I did not feel the comfort and support I once felt with him at all. He was very down to earth in our initial consultation.  Asked my husband and I personal questions, which I liked, as it made me think he wanted to get to know us and cared.  Always speaks to me like his equal, rather than a patient. Dr. Reichman is always extremely responsive to emails (answers usually right away) and questions I had while at the office for ultrasound appointments and bloodwork. However usually when I am there for ultrasounds the visit lasts less than 5 minutes and he doesn't ask if I have any questions and doesn't always explain what he's seeing in the ultrasound. However, when we first started seeing him, we had an hour meeting with him to discuss the plan and we just had another hour meeting with him to discuss potential IVF, in which he took the time to explain everything to us and answer any questions. He definitely treats me like a human and not just a number. Dr. Reichman seemed to understand how I was feeling about infertility treatments even though I couldn't figure it out. He made a plan that worked for me and my husband, and adjusted it as necessary over the course of a year so that I felt comfortable with what came next every step of the way. He has a really great sense of humor, is very direct and the level of care that he has for his patients comes through in every visit. Even though he was likely seeing dozens of patients a morning for very short periods of time, I could tell that Dr. Reichman always prepared himself to see me, knowing the details of my treatment and even remembering personal details about my job, husband etc. The front desk staff at WC are extremely friendly, and very quickly remembered my name which I was always impressed by. Dr. Reichman took the time to ask me exactly what I wanted out of the process and tailored a plan specifically for me, and treated me with precise care each visit Dr. Melnick and her team are very warm and very efficient. Most of my appointments have been in the morning before work (as it seems with most of her patients). She teaches and has surgeries during the regular hours I would have possibly been able to go in. My experience was always one of an efficient morning with caring people getting things done (reminded me of a family environment getting ready to go school / work in the morning).Based upon the process thus far, we are happy we chose Dr. Kang.  She has a nice demeanor, and is very easy to talk to but also professional & clinical.  I've been fortunate to see her for all my monitoring ultrasounds at CRM except one (which was with an RE fellow).  Given the volume of patients they have at the clinic, she is good with remembering our specifics and has been helpful in keeping our spirits up during what can be an emotional, difficult process.Dr. Davis is very accessible.  He always returns the call.  He speaks very fast. But he always try to give me answers to my questions. He is very realistic but in a warm way. Dr Elias is a very good listener who is willing to do everything he can to achieve our goals together. Our situation is very complicated with very low chances to conceive, but he never made us feel that it was impossible. He's ready to explore every treatment, every solution for us to get pregnant. I will never change for another doctor because he's really aware of our situation and always tries to do the best for us. Dr. Reichman didn't make us feel like a number or a human, he made us feel like we were friends. We was personable, patient, and shared in our ups and downs.We saw Dr Reichman after a heartbreaking ectopic pregnancy and having been through several fertility clinics that made us feel like we were being sold to. Dr Reichman, who came highly referred by a friend, felt like the first honest medical professional who didn’t try to “sell” and had a very pragmatic approach. He was very calm in assessing our situation, always presented us with pros/cons, and truly helped us make the best decisions. Even when there were moments where we wanted to jump the gun and get to the end result faster, he gave us very sound advice on the best route for a healthy baby. I had countless visits with him for close to 10 months, and each time he was fully present, empathetic, calm and wise. I felt like he saw me as a person not just another patient, and in his own grounded scientific way gave me the hope that I can become a parent. While Weill Cornell is an extremely busy practice, I appreciated the efficiency of my appointments, where I was usually in and out pretty quickly. While the nurses didn't know me personally (they see a TON of patients daily), they were always friendly and warm. I realized I was a ""number"" but was totally OK with that because I trusted the care of the team and always felt like I was in good hands.Dr. Reichman has this unique way of talking to people that makes you feel incredibly important. He listens to your concerns and creates a treatment plan that best suits your case. He makes himself available to you at all times and give precise explanations .Dr Elias always explained everything perfectly to my knowledge level so that I understood the process every step of the way. He is both extremely knowledgeable and kind. My interactions with Dr Elias always felt sincere. Dr. Reichman spent time getting to know me and my medical history which helped him to asses the best way to move forward.  He took the time to really understand my history and no detail was left unturned. He was personable, has great bedside manner and made me feel comfortable. Dr.Pereira is simply the best best best. The first time we met Dr. Pereira was after we had experienced a pregnancy loss. He couldn't have been more compassionate and he explained to us that he aims to treat his patients with the same care he would give to his family members. Now that we've been seeing Dr. Pereira for several months, I understand that he meant what he said during that first visit with him. Dr. Pereira has really made us feel like he has our back through the ups and downs and we couldn't be more appreciative.Dr. Pereira was always considerate and kind when it came to all of my questions -- and I had a lot of questions about the treatment, why I was feeling a certain way and every time I shared my symptoms, he was always prompt and caring with his responses. Additionally, he was never ""pushy"" with one type of treatment or another -- he always prioritized and understood what was important to me -- making me feel comfortable with my decisions as I listened to my body.Dr. Reichman was fantastic. He knew all the details of my case and I felt he really took the time to know me as a person. He was not only a thorough physician but thoughtful. The Tribeca office is incredible.  The front desk and nursing staff know most of the patients by name, are always helpful and responsive, and are extremely kind.  Dr. Reichman remembered details about our discussions, and always asked questions following up on our prior conversations.Dr. Pereira is very knowledgeable, warm, and compassionate.  When meeting with him he really treats you like family and helps put us at ease during an emotionally challenging time. Dr. P was always there for any questions & concerns. He must have spent at least an hour & a half to explain things to me in length and then again with my husband. After my egg retrieval i was crazy nervous and he spoke to me and relived a lot of my issues. Every time I saw him he knew why I was there, what happened last time & what i needed to do moving forward. Most importantly HE LISTENED! Dr. Reichman always came into the room knowing my information (ie where I was in a cycle, what the treatment plan was) and always knew even the most minute details of my case. He always let me ask questions during the appointment and I never felt he was rushed. Dr. Reichman was so compassionate. I went to him not knowing him at all, not knowing anyone he had treated before. I was at my lowest point before a few months before my OB who I never want to see ever again had told me ""there is no way you will have a baby unless you find a donor."" This was very hurtful considering A. She told me this not in her office but while I was crossing a busy intersection on the phone and B. She had not done any comprehensive tests on me and my husband. When I told Dr. Reichman this during our meeting, he said to ignore that as he was very confident my OB did not know what she was talking about. And right he was.   The office staff is very warm without being overly intrusive or clinical.  Dr. Pereira has a gentle bedside manner and it is clear he has a thought process to next steps.  He answers every question thoroughly and responds to emails and calls quickly.  The office has many doctors so the waiting room is often busy. I love Dr. Goldschlag, for me, I want to have all the answers and he is always calmly and patiently answered all my questions. When my IVF cycle did not go as planned he was more concerned about me and requested we try another cycle (low follicles), when I had to have a surgery in the uterus he did it and was with me along the way recommending we freeze the embryos rather than trying fresh first, and when I had a transfer he called me that same morning to convince me to transfer only one, which I am so happy I did. He really cares about you and the success of the process. Dr Melnick listened to my story, asked questions and showed genuine interest in helping my husband and I conceive. I felt heard and I felt known. She engaged by asking questions and reviewing my medical history with the two of us. Dr. Reichman is exceptionally personable, brutally honest (in a good way!!) and has a great sense of humor. He knew exactly how to communicate to my husband and me throughout the process.Dr. Pfeifer was always patient with my many questions. She never rushed me when I wasn't ready to do different treatments. Even when I could tell she was very busy my visits were never too rushed, and she called me back after work or set up separate appointments for times when I had additional questions. She was optimistic and positive during treatment cycles. She took into account my readiness for different interventions and the specifics of our exact situation when coming up with and changing treatment plans.She's very friendly but very fast.  Too quick doesn't pay enough attention to the case in front of her.  Dr. Pfeifer always took time to speak to me about the course of action, when results weren’t good she always made sure we spoke and reviewed next steps. She connected as a person not just about the care. She has a kind and friendly manner and tailored the treatment protocol to my specific situation, and advised against more aggressive treatments that she didn't feel were necessary yet.
Even though the Upper East Side facility of Weill Cornell as many described as well run facility, care providers, nurses, and doctors took reasonable time to answer questions I had.  When I had communicated with nurses from Dr.Davis's office over the phone, they were prompt and courteous.  Dr Periera always resounded to my emails right away and always had very polite bedside manner.Dr. Elias has great bedside manner and always took the time to answer my questions and explain things in a way I could understand. He always seems as though he genuinely cares.Dr. Melnick was personable, direct, and professional. Understood my reasons for pursuing egg freezing but did not do a hard sell - if anything she was adamant about me deciding to do so because I wanted rather than because of the scare tactics in stats, graphs, etc for fertility viability in women after 35. I’d also done an initial consultation with her in 2016, followed up in 2018 when I was actually ready. I appreciated being allowed the space and time to come to the decision on my own with professional advice if needed.It is a large clinic and on days for monitoring you feel like a number. On days when I see Dr. Goldschlag I feel more like a human.Dr. Davis  spoke to me honestly and explained in detail the statistical chances of success and the reasons for the protocol he’s chosen.He talked to me like a person. He answered all questions I had as he would a colleague, asked about my weekend plans and was flexible when it came to me getting testing done. And he made jokes. Most importantly, my husband liked him and he usually hates doctors. Dr Davis is a strong scientist.  He is not a hand-holder.  I felt like our interactions were very brief, straightforward and business-like.After meeting with Dr. Reichman, I had a spontaneous chemical pregnancy, 1 failed IUI, and then a spontaneous pregnancy which ended at 9 weeks, soon after being passed on to my OBGYN.  After my d and c, I had retained products of conception and my OBGYN wanted to do a second d and c.  Dr. Reichman called me and firmly told me not to do the second d and c and that it could affect future fertility, and offered to do a hysteroscopy instead.  I knew he truly cared about my well being.  I then had two IVF cycles with him.  The first round yielded 22 eggs, 10 mature, and 1 fertilized with ICSI.  That embryo failed to develop.  At the time he told us that it would be like lightning striking twice for similar result to happen again.  We tried a second round (everything was paid for out of pocket), had 26 eggs retrieved, 24 mature, and 0 fertilized with ICSI.  Dr. Reichman was truly stumped.  I don't fault him personally, but feel that if your case is tricky, Weill Cornell is not the place for you.  I am now under the care of another doctor and have already been diagnosed with PCOS among other things, which I am being treated for, but which never came to light at Cornell.  I believe the biggest mistake that Dr. Reichman made was allowing us to proceed with a second round without ensuring that we learned something from it (such as doing half with donor sperm).  After our final meeting with him post 2nd IVF, he still have no idea if it was an egg or sperm issue.  My husband has normal sperm count and motility, but low morphology, but that shouldn't have led to the results we got.  Dr. Reichman did offer us a third round at a discount to try a cycle without ICSI, but we didn't feel there was any evidence to put ourselves through that.Dr. Goldschalg and I get along very well. He has a very calming presence and helps bring me down off my crazy (sometimes hormone induced) tantrums about why it is not fair that I was not getting pregnant. He was very patient with me, always answered all my questions, talked to me about all the options and why something would be a good/bad/or ok idea for treatment. He always said that he would be willing to do anything I wanted, but he wanted me to listen to his opinion on the matter before making decisions. He knows that I am a healthcare professional and brings it up regularly, in explanation for decisions and for why he is explaining things to me in a scientific way. He talks to me in a way that I feel I understand what we are talking about, but that he respects my intelligence and research on our diagnosis. 

When we had a cycle fail with no viable embryos, Dr. Goldschlag called me several days in a row, sometimes multiple times a day to update me on the situation and make sure I was ok. We spent over an hour talking about the results and what we were going to proceed with and he did not hang up the phone until he knew I was ok, and we had scheduled an appointment to meet and go over everything, despite it being a holiday weekend. 

I know a lot of people who have cycled with Dr. Goldschlag sometimes are not pleased with their experience because they feel like a number, but I think that is more due to the size of the clinic. Cornell has hundreds of patients cycling through on a regular basis and if you do not stand up for yourself and advocate for your care, you may get lost, but if you are able to do that, you will get excellent care at a top rated clinic. Dr. Reichman always took the time to explain thoroughly every decision that we made. He was optimistic throughout, while allowing for me to feel disappointed each time I didn't get pregnant. When a potential complication arose, we had an hour-long appointment to discuss all possible options and outcomes.Dr Davis was always knowledgeable
About my situation. The nurses did not seem to always be knowledgeable and i felt like a number with them.With Dr. Pfeifer, I absolutely felt like a human 100%. She was kind, caring, and remembered many details about us and our situation without staring at a file. The nurses for my first 2 transfers were great, but my last transfer it seemed like the nurse changed every time I called and they seem to go really quickly and don't really like questions.Dr. Goldschlag always asks how I'm doing and gives thorough explanations of treatment and option. I always feel like he is doing what is in my best interest.  He has never pushed ivf treatment like some other doctors might do because that is where the money is.  Dr. Reichman remembers every detail of his patients' life and their cycles. He is friendly but not fake, which I appreciate.Dr. Reichman formed a relationship with us, asked after my husband on the occasions I had solo appointments. He was extremely responsive on emails, days, nights and weekend. He offered sincere condolences when cycles were not successful.Dr Elias frequently checked in with me and was always very quick to respond to my emails. More to the point, when my ivf cycle failed he left me a voicemail and expressed his sympathy.  During our follow up appointment soon after, he was caring, but also realistic presenting all the facts. Dr. Reichman knew exactly where we were in our treatment cycle, every time he saw us.  He needed no prompting about any of my personal details, or what our plan was.  And when I had emotional moments, the level of compassion he showed me was well beyond what I expect from even the best-trained medical professionals..Dr. Reichman was very caring through out the process, familiar with the specific facts of my case and my concerns, and willing and ready to answer all my questions.Right from the first time we met Dr. Reichman, he came across as a good and caring human being himself. He had our best interest in mind and devised a treatment plan to help achieve our goals. He has always been kind, compassionate and extremely well read which gives one tremendous confidence in his abilities.Dr. Reichman always responded promptly to emails.  There were many ups and downs during this process and he took time to have multiple sit downs to regroup and strategize throughout the process.  I felt like he genuinely cared about our case.Dr. Pfeifer is a kind and compassionate doctor.Dr. Goldschlag is a very kind doctor and will answer any questions, but you have to ask the questions or your time with him is limited and not filled with much information. At each appointment he scrolls through your files quickly, before speaking to you. It made me feel like he wasn't very familiar with my case. It would have made me feel more comfortable if he did that before entering the room or at least explained what he was looking at and why to make me feel more at ease. Dr. Goldschlag himself is extremely nice and sympathetic to the challenges one faces during this time. Although he is not particularly mushy or compassionate, he does come across as very very understanding and positive. My husband and i found his positive energy to be quite infectious. Even when he had to break bad news, i felt that he was holding my hand through it and validating my emotions. However- the overall feel of the Cornell Reproductive office is very much like a factory, causing you to feel like a number. Although the nurses are nice, sometimes they seem like robots and i felt like i was bothering them whenever i had a question. It often feels like you are just a box they are checking off their list. Dr Goldschlag makes you feel more human, but for the rest of it you tend to feel like a number.When I had one on one meetings with Dr. Pfiefer, she always made me feel like a human and not a number.  She was attentive and up to date on what was going on with me.  When I dealt with the nurses at time, I felt like a number.  While Dr. Schattman has a ton of patients, he made a real effort to do my scans each morning, especially since we were from out of town. he answered all of my questions, even when rushed, and always called me back within 24 hours. Dr Reichman has excellent bedside manners. He makes sure his patients are comfortable. He does not sugarcoat anything and gives you realistic outcomes. Dr. Davis treats you with respect.  He is an extremely responsive physician who does not sugar coat issues but has a healthy degree of optimism.  Dr. Melnick was amazing! Not only is she brilliant and professional, but she has an amazing bedside manner.  She was extremely responsive to my questions.    She followed up appropriately with good and bad news throughout our treatments. She genuinely cared about helping us get pregnant and ultimately bring our baby into the world.Dr Chung was caring and always spoke to my husband and I with enthusiasm and a optimistic flair. While he was always brief and to the point, our interactions didn't feel overly clinical.Dr. Reichman did all my monitoring himself when he was in the office. He often met with us to discuss any questions we had, and he was great at replying to questions via email. My experience with him was completely different then the previous doctor I was treated by in Utah. (I only saw her three times and we did multiple cycles, and ivf with her!) I loved working with Dr. Reichman and felt he truly cared about us. He was amazing! Dr. Pfeiffer was always very kind and honest when we had our one on one time. The morning monitoring hours were always very compact/rushed due, so it was always brief and to the point, while always remaining positive and encouraging. Infertility is a very emotional process and Dr. Reichman helped to ease the emotions that came along with it. During our initial session, he was most informative and understanding in sharing the different options available. Dr. Reichman answered all of our questions and never made use feel as though we should be embarrassed to ask such questions. From all of our appointments had with Dr. Reichman, it is clear that he is a compassionate individual who takes great pride in what he does.  He truly made our second experience with infertility issues a pleasurable one and I highly recommend his medical advice and treatment. Dr. Reichman was awesome from our initial consultation. He is honest, informative and caring, while still being straight forward. He looked at the whole picture (diet, exercise, lifestyle factors) and really got honest with me about which ones I needed to work on (diet & exercise). He is positive and optimistic, but also realistic. Dr. Elias is simply the best dr.  He is really compassionate and always recommends the route he feels is best without pushing you.  He gives you the facts and is patient about any and all questions you may have.  He is always available and always gets back to you either directly or through one of his great staff. He understood this was my first Ivf cycle and really tried to explain things as clearly as possible. One day I had a breakdown and he took time to really address my worries and stress.We had a few tough cycles, including our very first cycle where I got pregnant right away. Not only did Dr. Reichman celebrate with us each time we got good news, but would also mourn with us when we miscarried or had to cancel a cycle. He would call to check in to make sure I was okay on days we got bad news and we write emails of celebratory encouragement each time we got good news. He was always responsive when I reached out and took the time to answer any questions I had when I had appointments. I honestly felt like he really cared about the success of our family, and not just because it meant money or success for him. He actually cared that we received the result we were hoping to achieve and was willing to help us to anything to get there. Dr. Reichman always explained me everything very patiently, was quite accommodating of my schedule and made sure to give me a personalized treatment. He somehow always remembered every conversation we had over email or in person and it never needed any reminding from my sideDr Elias was extremely attentive and answered all my questions intelligently. He did it ignore, belittle, or minimize any concerns. I think he’s intelligent and caring. She is very smart and pleasant.  She takes her time to speak with me and validates my concerns.  She is human and always present...It may not be her, but someone from her office always call back.The clinic is large, it is always overly crowded during monitoring hours and you can’t help to feel like a number. However when I needed to speak with drDavis he was always available and either answered my questions through email or returned my phone call within a couple of hours.Dr. Pfeifer has great bedside manner and made me feel like a patient who deserved to be informed and educated throughout the process, but did not sugar coat things either and gave me straightforward information and assessments of my diagnosis and treatment.Davis speaks very quickly but is also very thorough. It is obvious that he is very experience and is aware that there is not one or even 10 protocols that work for all patients. The cycles with him feel very individualize to you the patient based on your prior historyCouldn’t say enough great things about Dr. Reichman, he’s young sharp and he’s a problem solver. No bs but treats his patients very well.When we had our initial consultation, he really seemed invested and studied my husband and I. He asked a lot of questions and asked us to elaborate and get specific relevant details related to family history. I vividly remember him sitting in our first consultation for a solid hour and he seemed truly invested in the cause, you could see the wheels spinning in his mind.Dr. Reichman was empathetic, considerate and went above and beyond to give the best care possible.  He was completely committed to getting me pregnant and explored all potential issues, while fixing many things that other specialists missed.  He is very smart and dedicated to his work; seeing that patients get the best care.He spent ample time with my husband and I during our first consultation and again after our transfer didn’t work. He answered our questions to our satisfaction.  He returned phone calls.  Only at the end, did he not respond to my email seeking advice on what to do next.I came to see Dr. Spandorfer after my husband and I had been trying for 1 year. He reviewed all of my paperwork and addressed my initial questions, but told me to get all these tests done (HSG, Saline Sonogram, genetic testing) and then come back and see him. I realize this is the process for new patients to rule out all possibilities of why you are infertile, but I felt a little dismissed since I came to him with a mound of paperwork from previous doctors. I guess I more expected him to go over my history and perhaps see if something from my past was causing the issues. 

Everything came back normal and unfortunately I was diagnosed with unexplained infertility and I was to start Clomid. I am the type who wants to know everything, and when it is happening, but I felt like it was very hard to get answers. He didn't explain the process or next steps, and at my next appointment I was told I would be getting an IUI and my husband needed to be available. I was so overwhelmed. I felt like i relied more on friends for answers, than the doctor. 

Also, the office at Cornell caused me the most stress of the entire process. Getting someone on the phone, figuring out insurance, Pre-certification ... everything was a total nightmare with this office and I was constantly figuring all of this out on my own. I ended up leaving the practice after my third IUI.While Dr. Goldschlag is clearly a caring and dedicated doctor and his practice coordinator Shanise is his biggest asset, no single doctor or doctor/patient coordinator duo can make up for the extreme institutional disorganization that plagues Weill Cornell/CRM.  The prior authorization process is basically an exercise in begging to get things done and a lack of education/support from the billing team resulted in a medication debacle that set us back several thousands of dollars.It's a huge clinic but the nurses and the doctors all did a good job of making me feel comfortable there.During my 3 cycles with Dr. Kligman, I only saw him a handful of times. Cornell treats a high volume of patients and as such, during monitoring, I was seen by various nurses, residents, and doctors.  Dr Schattman was very sympathetic to the process.  As we encountered bumps in the road he would always give the advice he would give as if it were his wife.  Cornell can be tough to navigate given that it is such a large center for fertility patients but he told me that I could always reach out to him directly with any concerns/questions vs having to funnel it through one of the nurses.Dr. Reichman was just wonderful. From the beginning, he took into account my specific situation and goals, and we came up with an action plan together. He doesn’t sugarcoat and manages expectations realistically, which I appreciated tremendously. He also was incredibly responsive to all of my questions and concerns. Cornell's practice as a whole is more like a factory. You sit in a packed waiting room every day with countless other women, see a rotation of nurses and fellows and don;t really build warm relationships with staff. The transfer/retrieval process is even worse - sitting for hours in a small waiting room wearing nothing but a robe, watching other women go in and out of the operating room, etc. It is not a warm and fuzzy place.

Dr. G himself, on the other hand, is very warm and caring. He called me personally both times I miscarried, had an open door policy, and always remembered small tidbits I had shared. I think he is a wonderful doctor - his personality doesn't jive with the setting.

WARRIOR REVIEWDr. Reichman is very kind and caring. I went to him because a friend recommended him. She liked his bedside manner. I also liked his bedside manner. I could tell that our visits truly affected him and that he felt genuinely sad for me when he had to give me bad news. I think he teared up while talking to me and said some really nice things like ""You will get your second child."" It was all very human. And the Cornell practice overall felt like a state of the art facility plus individualized care so that's a great combo.Dr. Schattman was very professional. He got to the point and was transparent, which I greatly appreciated. Although he was rather impersonal, he was kind and I trusted that he was giving me honest and sound information based on my particular circumstances. He was conscientious about my comfort during procedures.Dr. Elias knew me and my situation and I never felt like a number. His staff in Mt Kisco also knew me and they were all very kind and helpful.Weill Cornell Reproductive Medicine is a very large clinic. I mainly saw Dr Kang at the Long Island office so I mostly felt like I was treated like a human. It was only when I had to report into the UES office where you realize the sheer number of patients that go through that office a day, and feel like just a number.Cornell is a large facility. You will not see your doctor at morning monitoring. The nurses are your first point of contact and very responsive. When I had an appointment with Dr. Kligman he was always personable and professional. Although I would not expect any doctor at Cornell to be a hand holder. Cornell in general is a high volume clinic so that alone can make you feel like you are a number, however, whenever I had 1:1 time with Dr. Pfeifer by phone or in person, she always made you feel important and valued.After 2 of my failed transfers, Dr. Spandorfer called me on the phone unprompted to tell me he was sorry that the transfers did not work.He took the time to explain the results of my tests to help me understand them. He was very thorough in all his testing. If you have no strong reason to doubt your fertility, I'm sure Dr. Spandorfer would be fine. His initial impression is of sort of a big friendly teddy bear with a touch of frat boy who speaks in plain language. If however, you are in a situation where you think you will likely have a hard time becoming pregnant, I would move on. Once my hormone level tests came back, he became very short with me. Just said that it was very unlikely I'd have kids and when I asked questions, he was impatient and was rushing me out of there. He was blunt, cut me off so abruptly when I misunderstood something and seemed irritated. No compassion at all, just told me like he was giving the weather and left me sitting there with my pants off on the table as he rushed to the next patient. I felt so vulnerable and it was awful. He was however, always willing to have me come back to do a sonogram and blood tests. I was clear from day one that I was against donor conception for very personal reasons. He not once, not twice, but three times pushed it after I was 100% straightforward that I'd either not have children or adopt if that was my only option. Needs a lot of work with compassion and bedside manner. I've sinced moved on to a smaller office and had much better treatment from a kind and caring doctor.
AwfulHe's a good guy. He gives us his honest opinion even when not in his financial best interest. Answers all questions no matter how small. Understands the emotional impact of it all. Willing to customize a plan to your situation and adjust. Delivers bad new honestly without hiding it hasn't given us false hope. He has always been very patient with me in allowing me to ask questions. I never feel like he is rushing me. He is very kind when I've been upset.I started seeing Dr. Pfeifer after my second miscarriage because my OB/GYN thought I may have more success if I try IVF with PGS testing. I appreciated that Dr. Pfeifer didn't just jump to IVF and instead ran tests to assess next steps. She ultimately suggested we try again on our own if we were up to it and once we were pregnant she would monitor us closely for the first 10 weeks. We ended up getting pregnant on our own but had another loss. She was very caring during the whole process and seemed invested in our success. We are now starting the IVF process with her. Dr Elias replies to emails regularly even over the weekend.  When I was having an ectopic pregnancy - I was in a tremendous amount of pain and he replied to my emails over night.  Though I don't see him usually more than once or twice a cycle, I feel like he follows my case closely.   Ina was lovely but the process at WC makes you feel like a #. You see a lot of different doctors and dont hear from your main dr often. Youre not told how youre doing during the cycle and i was unclear as to how often my chart was reviewed by Doctor. I was in contact with the nurses more than Cholst, although she did do her best to be available for 2 discussions during the cycle and after our initial consults and tests.  The cycle was straightforward, it didnt feel personalized and i felt that a ball was dropped a few times- i wasnt contacted day of transfer- they forgot to call me, and I wasnt told that one embryo had a late fert until i was in the operating room for transfer. I was also triggered a day earlier than Dr. Cholst had predicted and had no follicles over 16.  i think this was a mistake. He always addressed all of my questions, made an effort to be available for as many monitoring appts as possible and called with important news related to my retrievals.  Also, when I did ultimately have a miscarriage- he was unbelievable compassionate, present and kind to me throughout the whole ordeal.Dr. Davis' nursing staff is extremely responsive and caring. There are a high number of patients for daily monitoring; however, most Dr's took the time during ultrasounds to explain the results and answer questions. Patients see whichever Dr is in duty for monitoring, retrievals and transfers. Cornell has a reputation for being a ""factory-like"" clinic, and I echo the sentiment in regards to monitoring, nursing staff, etc.  There are improvements to be made, for sure, but on the whole it is a well run clinic.  However, I have never felt like Dr. Kligman was not fully invested in my success and cared personally about my care.  If we saw one another on the street, he would recognize me, call me by name and stop for a chat.  Dr Goldschlag is polite but it can sometimes feel a bit rushed when speaking with him.  However, I do not mind, I like a doctor that is knowledgable and gets to the point quickly.  However, the clinic and the process for making appointments and getting in touch with the doctor's staff can make you feel like a number. It is impossible to communicate via email or to speak to someone the first time you call, you must always leave a message and they will return your call.  Also, the doctor's hours are very inconvenient. I understand that this is a process that is time consuming, however, I wish appointment times were more convenient and the office was more accommodating for working professionals.Even though the practice at CRM is huge, everyone I met with treated me with respect and kindness. There are literally hundreds of patients waiting in the monitoring room each day yet I did not encounter any frustrated doctors, nurses, or other staff. Whenever I met with Dr. Davis, he was completely up to speed on my treatment.Zev is a man of few words, but when he speaks, everyone listens. He does not over promise, and is very direct. After my first cycle with him that resulted in a miscarriage, Zev did all my morning monitoring himself, even came in on a weekend. When I came in for my beta, he was waiting for me and personally walked me to get my blood drawn. I feel like this is pretty rare, and even if he is not present all the time, he is studying your case. The good part as others have said is she is at the monitoring appointments which is nice. If she is not there you will see the other doctor she shares the office with. Once we moved from IUI to IVF I felt more like a human - and more attention was paid to my case. The monitoring hours are very rushed and you don't have the chance to ask questions or get detailed answers from her - but you get a call from your nurse every day after blood work and ultrasound and they are great resources for questions.Dr. Goldschlag made me fee like a human but Cornell as a whole is a factory. The place is definitely a factory, so the face-to-face time is usually quite short. Dr. Kang, however, is very good at still making me feel like she knows who I am. She's always very warm.We were strongly advised to transfer two fresh embryos by Dr. Spandorfer. When this transfer resulted in a chemical pregnancy, he then advised us to transfer only one on the next try and claimed that he did not recall giving us the advice to previously transfer two. This made us feel like he was simply trying to augment his live birth rate and was not concerned about our case whatsoever. I speak to the same nurse whenever I have questions, and the doctor knows me and my history.Dr Pfeiffer is warm, practical, and no-nonsense. In our initial session, she wanted to hear all about the life circumstances that had brought me to her clinic. We discussed how they had impacted by physical and reproductive health. She was realistic yet encouraging about my prospects. Dr Owen Davis was very personable, listened to my preferences with respect, and was upfront with the statistics of achieving pregnancy at my age.  He always called back within 36hrs of leaving a message, sometimes within 2 - 4 hrs.The staff here was perfectly nice, however no one would recognize you and it definitely had a factory feel. He was very attentive and explained everything about the procedure. I felt he was VERY vested in getting us pregnant!Dr. Kang is very personable.  From the beginning, she knew who I was and my medical history, without referencing notes or charts.Hundreds of women come for monitoring and appointments every day. Dr. Chung did his best to explain things but it is difficult to spend more than 15 minutes with a patient. It is also difficult to call or email and get a response directly from your specific doctor. After 4pm or 5pm there is an answering service. A message is sent to the attending on call for that particular evening and you get a call back about an hour or two later.Dealing with infertility already comes with its own set of challenges. And if one comes across a doctor who gives you hope while being realistic is definitely a sign. I saw Dr Pfeifer in 2016 and there were so many small obstacles to jump before i could embark on a fertility treatment in 2018; I think she did a great job of being with me every step of the way.He took the time to explain everything. He was very realistic but always encouraging. He was always available if I had a question and called to follow up after both of my miscarriages with genuine concernIt is a very busy office, and I usually got a nurse or other doctor. I only saw Dr. Goldschlag a few times, but he was always easy to work with when I did get to see him. You check in for monitoring with a swipe card which is cool. The office is run pretty efficiently but it can be a challenge to accommodate every little thing you need because they are so busy.The doctors and nurses at the clinic were very responsive and willing to take time to answer all of my questions. Dr Spandorfer puts you at ease with humor and gives you hope.Dr Chung was very compassionate, did not rush me through our consult, answered all my questions and concerns, and really took the time to make me feel heard.  He called me personally after the retrieval to give me an update, and also called me to provide status on the embryo development.  When the cycle didn't work out, he was very empathetic and supportive.I only saw my doctor 2 times throughout my entire IVF cycle. I had no direct way of getting in touch with him. If I called the clinic it would take him several days to call me back. After my negative pregnancy test he didn't return my call for three days. I also specifically asked him to not put me with a certain nurse if I did IVF with him he agreed and then put me with that nurse and then said I had no choice. He should have told me that from the beginningIt's hard not to feel like a number when there are many women seen at this clinic, and they have to get through all those patients each morning, but I did feel a connection with her. There were times when we would get caught up in conversation and a nurse would come in to move her along to the next patient. Dr. Reichman was always warm, honest and got to know us.  He took the time to talk us through different options and concerns. He was supportive when we encountered challenges. Dr. Schattman is very direct and takes time to explain the various procedures, treatments, etc. That said, monitoring hours are not long and he has many patients so the appointments are kept brief and to the point. When we suffered our miscarriage, however, he was delicate and took extra time with us to discuss next steps. He also wanted to make sure he was present for all procedures pertaining to the miscarriage which made us feel like he really took ownership of the process.I saw Dr. Kabg frequently during the course of monitoring, which helped me feel more connected to her. Dr. Reichman is an amazing doctor. You never feel rushed or like just a number. He is always personable, lending an ear for questions or concerns and available for questions during and after your appointment. He goes above and beyond to make sure you are cared for and understand procedures and process. Once, there was a power outage, and patient records were not available. However, Dr. Reichman needed no prompting about my history or circumstance, even despite seeing multiple patients an hour at an ungodly time. Another time, my husband was late to my first ultra sound hearing the heartbeat. He quickly repeated it since my husband made the trip from work. I couldn't be happier with Dr. Reichman's care, professionalism and results.Dr Rosenwaks is passionate about helping his patients create their families.  He is a legend in his profession but still treats every new patient with focus, determination, and compassion. I felt he was extremely invested in my care and his entire staff felt like family to me by the end of the ivf process. After my first failed cycle I was upset. Upon the start of my current cycle, I got information as to why things did not work the first time (ectopic pregnancy), the percentages involved in the number of women that experience this, etc. As for my every day care, I had daily calls from the nurses following tests with individualized instructions. When I could not get in contact with the staff,I would leave a message, and my call was always returned. Dr. Schlegel and his staff are incredibly compassionate and very responsive. Kathleen (nurse) and Jewn (admin) are easily accessible by phone and email. Dr. Schlegel himself always treated us and our grim situation with utmost respect. He was very honest and realistic. I saw Dr. Pfeifer every time I went in for tests or monitoring.  She clearly remembered who I was from appointment to appointment, knew exactly what was going on and where I was in my cycle, and knew my name (and addressed me as such) without having to check the chart.Although there were always many many patients in the waiting room at Cornell every time I went there, I felt like they were always doing their best to be successful. Dr Schattman always made it a point to call with big results and patiently walked through information and asked if I had any questions. I felt taken care of and that someone was thinking ahead about my cycle.Dr. S. Talks with us about our broader lives... Podcasts we like, ski trips, our marital status (this changed a lot as we worked with Dr. both pre- and post-DOMA's overturning, so we had lots of questions as a somewhat-recognized-married-couple. After the miscarriage (result of IUI #3), Dr. S. was both compassionate and matter of fact. He personally did the IUI for attempt #5, and that is the one that resulted in our daughter. We had been working with him for a year before we got to IUI #5 and he understood our disappointment that it took so long. He also explained the science (especially what we saw in the sonograms which I greatly appreciated!)At the Long Island office there was more time for questions versus the NYC office.Dr. Reichman is kind, caring, and willing to answer all of your questions. He responds to emails quickly and thoroughly and never rushes you out of the examination. I truly felt like he had my best interest at heart. Obviously, doctors in that situation can't tell you what to do, but Dr. Reichman would say, ""If it were my wife, this is what I would suggest..."" This statement truly brought me comfort and made me feel like I was in good hands. I was truly shocked that on our first visit, he sat down with my husband and I for SO long to get our family medical histories. He was BLUNT but caring, and took a lot of time to explain options. While Cornell has tons of patients undergoing cycles at any one time, the fact that they process you through their massive system didn't make me feel like a number - I appreciated that they had such a system, which made things efficient and move quickly!  

In his consultation with me, Dr. Davis truly listened, and was willing to take as much time as I needed to answer my questions and discuss my options.  He is truly a caring doctor as well as being brilliant.Cornell is a large center.  I feared there could be a chance of feeling like a number.  But, I had complications along the way, specifically a very dangerous ectopic pregnancy.  I could get ahold of Dr. Davis any time I needed to.  He responded quickly to all of my inquiries.  He set face to face meetings on very short notice when they were warranted.  He provided great patient care.Dr. Kang personally was fabulous and gave me a lot of personal attention, but she practiced in a very busy academic clinic setting. I didn't see the same doctor for monitoring appointments and she did not perform my egg retrieval. She did go out of her way to ensure she performed my embryo transfer. She personally called me with important developments throughout the cycle and I liked all the nurses and coordinators. He was always very pleasant, could crack a good (but still professional) joke here or there, and even though he may have simply glanced at my chart right before he walked in every time to remind himself who I was in the first month or so (I mean, let's be honest), it never felt like that - it always seemed like he knew just who I was. Dr. Schattman was very involved in my case from the get-go. He took ample time to sit and explain thing to me and my husband. He was readily available whenever we had questions. My first retrieval was not as successful as we or he wanted it to be and he was very honest about that. He was candid in saying that he was disappointed and thought we could do better with a stronger protocol. I appreciated that he didn't sugarcoat or tell me that this was the best we could do. We moved forward with another retrieval and he switched the protocol and we nearly doubled the amount of eggs we were able to retrieve and quadrupled the amount of embryos we were able to create. CRM is very popular and people come from all over the world.  I found the nurses to be extremely helpful and friendly.  Some of the phlebotomists were more friendly than others.  Yes, it had a bit of a factory feel but that was not my actual experience 1:1.The interactions I had with dr. Davis were great. He knew my records pretty well and always had a plan or next step, which gave me a lot of confidence that I would get pregnant eventually- he made me fell as a human not a number. However, those interactions were only in the first appointment and after failed cycles, in between all my interactions were with the nurses and then I felt like a number. In general Weill Cornell is a bit of a factory - they move a lot of women through the practice. My interactions with Dr. Elias have been less than expected since he is between NYC and Westchester. He is always very polite and informative - and I do really like him - but he can be very cold. Like when I first found out my pregnancy was not viable and I would miscarry he said ""This is a good thing -you can get pregnant"" - or when I later had to have surgery for what was an ectopic pregnancy he seemed very cavalier about removing the tube. I'm sure he sees everything 10X a day - but this was a first pregnancy, first miscarriage and then first surgery.After a long, bad experience at a more commercial IVF clinic in NYC, Weill-Cornell  was like a breath of fresh air.  Literally, actually.  The waiting room had natural light coming from big windows as opposed to being a cramped crowded dark space space. The facility was clean with new looking equipment as opposed to the other facility I'd been a patient at.  And I found Cornell to be much more efficiently run.   To answer the number versus human question a bit more directly, Spandorfer was really not phased by my high FSH  and low antral follicle count. Unlike my doctor at my previous clinic, Spandorfer told me he would be willing to go ahead to retrieval even if we only managed to produce one bag he said it was my decision.  That made me feel like he respected my agency and like he wasn't fixated on statistics. I really feel like Dr. Kang and her team knew me and were invested in me getting pregnant. It's hard to believe with such a crowded waiting room - you know they have a lot of patients. But I never felt rushed, I felt like we were real partners in the whole journey.Not so much the doctor but the clinic is truly a baby making factory. That's why you're there and that's what their good at. When I saw Chung he was great and sweet and efficient but he checked, he explained and he left. Often times as you're getting closer to IVF you're there daily seeing whatever Doctor is there. Everyone at the clinic has a specific role, it's the most efficiently run operation I've ever seen. I didn't mind the way I was treated, I had 1 goal in mind and they knew how to accomplish it. He has so many patients that in the morning blood draws and ultrasounds, about 150 women are shuffled through like cattle. He doesn't have time to answer a lot of questions. If you want to speak to him, you should really make an appointment in the afternoon with him. The times when he treated me most like a human were after all the negative news- our first round of IVF resulting in a miscarriage and our second round resulting in not pregnant at all. He called me personally on my cell. I came to realize that if it was good news, a nurse called you, but if it was bad news, he called you. So you actually didn't want to hear his voice on the other end of the phone.With a small practice out in Garden City, LI, it never felt crowded and there was rarely anyone waiting in the waiting room. NP's also gave us the proper amount of attention. The only time it felt like an IVF factory was at the Cornell facility  in the city for blood draws and procedures. But that is expected since it's a huge hospital. Dr. Kang's practice, itself, felt very small and personal.Couldn't even reach the doctor when I needed to. Never received word on number of eggs retrieved. No word on embryos or how fertilization went or what to expect. No word from the doctor period after retrieval. Dr. Elias has a wonderful bedside manner. He is kind, patient and is invested in his patients care and success. He is very knowledgeable about infertility, about his patients needs and explains things thoroughly. It's large operation and clinic, which can make it feel impersonal. However that is also what makes it work well operationally and be efficient. I thought Dr. Kang brought the personal touch up quite a bit once she saw how upset I was after the first couple of times not working. Prior to that it was much more clinical, maybe too much so for some people. After leaving a doctor who never remembered my name and made little attempt to address my problems -- low ovarian reserve and recurring pregnancy loss (3 miscarriages) -- I arrived for a consult with Dr. Davis with low expectations.  He sat with my husband and me for probably an hour and a half, repeating my medical history from memory.  I couldn't believe how much time he had spent with my file before sitting down with us.  He also began by addressing why he thought I was experiencing the miscarriages.  He didn't try to push more IVF until he had determined why the miscarriages were occurring. When I came to Dr. Spandorfer, I'd already been told by two other doctors that there was likely no hope for me to have a baby.  Dr. Spandorfer said, ""there's always hope,"" and agreed to treat me - unlike my previous two doctors who'd declined to treat me again because of two failed IVF cycles.  They didn't want to reduce their clinic's success ratings.  Dr. Spandorfer was kind, funny, steadfast - and his expertise as a physician made me into the mom of a beautiful, amazing baby.He's kind, respectful, and provides as much detail as one wants to know about one's treatment.  The staff were lovely, too (with the exception of one obnoxious phlebotomist).During my first cycle at Cornell. my mother died unexpectedly the day before I was supposed to start stims. Dr. Davis, and the entire staff, could not have been more kind. They held me on Lupron for a week and we decided to cycle. Cancelling would have been devastating -- I had to travel to cycle -- and it was the right thing to do, and they gently supported me through it. That cycle was successful. I love this clinic, & especially Dr. Davis. Dr. Schattman is warm, honest and optimistic without creating  my false expectations. He is open to questions and once you’re with him he takes time to listen to your concerns. Dr. Pfeifer is really thorough in explaining what is going in. She is also very compassionate and empathetic which I really appreciated. He is kind, patient, and professional. Never pushy. Willing to discuss any questions. Doesn’t involve his ego or alternative agendas. I know he really cares.This is a big clinic, so there is definitely a feel of being more of a number than a human. I will say that I felt more personal attention was given when I transitioned from IUI patient to IVF patient and then again after a failed fresh transfer. Every single person in the tribeca office showed so much support and concern and really felt like an extended family. While this is a very personal and emotional process, there was constant support paired with the best care from the tribeca office. Dr. Reichman always took my concerns seriously and compassionately guided us through every step of the process. I never felt rushed when seeing him and he seemed genuinely invested in our situation.Dr. Pereira was very professional and explained everything in detail. However, I felt that his area of opportunity was to understand that I also had questions. He expressed through his tone and body language that he seemed slightly agitated when I had questions.She listens, she is empathetic, she  remains optimistic but realistic, she creates individualized plans, she is patient and will spend as much time with you as you need.First, she made an extremely rude and insensitive comment when diagnosing my wife with endometriosis. She said ""now you can be one of those women on the commercials"". She spent very little time on initial visit and hardly explained anything. Every other visit afterwards she would come in the room, do what she wanted to do and leave. She'd roll her eyes and get agitated if we tried to ask questions. Dr. Pereira was always very compassionate and caring about what I was going through. He seems invested in taking my feelings and opinions into account while guiding my husband and I on the path he thinks will work for us. I never felt like he was rushing or just doing the same thing he does with all his patients. Dr Schlegel properly diagnosed my male inftertility, and took surgical steps to improve the situation. We thought that getting an appointment with him would be nearly impossible given his repuation, however we were able to schedule our first appointment within a matter of weeks. He never rushed our meetings and would answer all questions He has many many patients and during appointments, I never saw him more than 5 minutes at a time.Dr. Reichman is kind and professional and takes time to answer questions and understand my goals. He is great at going through the options, giving me the information and letting me decide.She is cery responsive to all of my questions and explains everything thing really well.  She is up front and honest in her assessment.  My visits with Dr. Kligman were extremely brief. When I asked questions, I received short answers and not much explanation. I was often made to feel as though I should already know the answers to the questions I asked. I believe he is thorough and careful, especially when tweaking the protocol for each cycle, but I wish he were more forthcoming with details, and spent more time making sure his patients felt informed and clear about their current status as well as future steps.Dr. Davis was very warm and sensitive. Daily monitoring at the facility is much less personal. Dr. Davis was responsive whenever I reached out with questions, but you have to be proactive in order to get that attention. Dr. Kang is caring and compassionate and always treats us with respect.Dr. Spandorfer was amazing.  The whole process where they scream your name in a waiting room was not great.  I think Dr. Schattman is a good doctor. He is straight forward, he moves fast and it can be hard to keep up. Be prepared with your questions. I believe Dr. Schattman cares about his patients and tries for the best possible outcomes.
Overall, good doctor though he can be hard to reach. He does not email so getting him on the phone is a challenge.He was always quick and efficient which could make you feel like a number but if I ever had questions he did take his time to answer them which made me feel like a human Dr. Elias has a very good bedside manner. He always checked in, followed up and did his best to be at and do my transfers himself.When meeting with Dr. Davis, he really took the time to answer all your questions. Never made me feel rushed. Always had an answer for me based off of statistics. He just really knew what he was doing. never made me feel like what i was asking was insane or unheard of. Dr.Kligman's team were very responsive to my questions, requests for information, etc, and all of my care felt like it was based on a real analysis of my needs, not a cookie cutter med protocol. i thought she was just delightful and caring.  i totally trusted her and thought she had good judgement.Dr Kang always seemed confused about why I was experiencing upset, and didn't want to hear about the circumstances surrounding my treatment (financial stress and so on). I didn't expect her to provide mental health services, but some empathy would have gone a long way. Very compassionate and sympathetic. Involved us in the decisionmaking much more than other doctors I've encountered. Office visits were with her or more often with the on call doc. Had to go to the city and wait in huge waiting room with tons of other patients for blood draw and ultrasound.I felt like Dr. Spandorfer played by the book--you must do three cycles of Clomid before going on to injectables but then he perked up before my second round of injectibles and that's the one that workedCornell is like a factory - very crowded during monitoring.Dr. Reichman was straight forward but compassionate and optimistic. When I received my positive beta he was overjoyed for my husband and myself. In the room with him, always like a human. In the waiting room or pre-op (ie policy of the clinic), DEFINITELY like a number. Pak Chung was very attentive. The clinic itself you feel a bit like a number, but he was great.He is sensitive to our needs and in person when I met him with my wife he was candid and realistic in his approach. He understands the emotional aspect to this proccess and offerred help and recommendations.Dr. Kang is an excellent doctor who connected with us in a very human and very real way. In short, she thinks the way we think and it was a great relief. Dr Reichman was fantastic at explaining the best course of treatment thoroughly so I could make the best decision for myself. She takes her time with me. She includes me in the decision making and respond with compassion and care.Cornell is a large program but Dr. G was always available. He returned calls the same day and even called just to update me on the progress.So many patients, only saw the doctor on some days, usually a different doctor for monitoring. Different doc or egg retrieval and for transfer When expressing interest in natural therapies in addition to clinical, I was quickly dismissed. Also, at times, my appointments felt rushed. Very quick and short time dedicated to explain the patient the alternatives, his analysis of the existing issues and recommendation. However he is very experienced and trustable.Dr Kang completely personalized my care, she was so patient and thoughtful, and she helped push when needed.He was there for me since day 1, did most of the ultrasounds, retrieval and the transfer. He was always very positive and reassuring.Very nice man. Great bedside manner. Never made me feel anxious or uncomfortable. He was confident but also empathetic. Very smart. He was compassionate and understanding.Dr. Spandorfer could do a better job of explaining the process, what to expect, and what’s going on with my body. Dr Davis has amazing and sensitive bedside manner.  His nurses were sometimes not the same way but he was very responsive when I talked to him about it.Dr Schattman has been very involved in my trying to get pregnant. He was able to diagnose my reoccurring miscarriages and set a course of treatment for my body to get back in shape to even house a pregnancy. He is very statistics driven and by the numbers but he delivers the news wirh kindness and optimism. Dr Pereria is absolutely wonderful. He would come in to see us on his day off. He did my retrieval even though he wasn’t working. He called and emailed me personally. He told me at the beginning of treatment that I didn’t need to worry about getting pregnant anymore because that would now be his job. He's personable and kindDr. davis has very good bedside manners. He is usually available on email and phone call even during the weekends. He studied my previous cycle carefully and tried different protocolsDr. Spandorfer spoke to me like an intelligent adult.  He gave us choices every step of the way.  He is very responsive.  He answered all my questions and made me truly feel like he was individually invested in my successHe personally calls you after every major result. He seems to genuinely care about your results. He has great bedside mannerisms. Dr goldschelg was great, but his nursing team seems to be cold and treated me as a number Dr. Braverman met with us and explained thoroughly what he suspected was causing my miscarriages. He was very detailed. He is simply brilliant and the bestHe actually remembered who I was without referring to a chart.Dr. Spandorfer does not have a warm bedside manner. He is very matter-of-fact and not compassionate, especially for someone who has experienced a total of 7 miscarriages. There were moments when he seemed like he really cared.  Many more times when I was a number and was treated by him and staff with little compassion.Dr.  Reichman is incredibly personable and genuine. He always seemed present and I never felt rushed. He was the most amazing sweetest caring doctor. When i had a miscarriage he was just as devastated as I was. straight forward they called your name when it was your turn.Dr. K's listened to everything we had to share. 
He was light-hearted and very honest with his medical diagnosis. 
He is also gave us all of our options so we were well prepared to choose what was best for our treatment choices.I waited upwards of 2 hrs per visit for ultrasound and bloodwork, I hardly ever saw Dr Chung during my visits and could never get a hold of him to ask questions. Dr. Davis exemplifies compassionate care and was incredibly thoughtful and sensitive yet direct in all of our interactions. Constantly accessible, answered every question, patient, called a number of times to make sure we went over each step and walked me through concerned risks. Never made me wait at appointments. She was very compassionate and remembered me and my husband each visitDr. Rosenwaks takes the time to talk to me realistically, but compassionately.  He is honest about my chances, but never puts me down for wanting to continue to try.I saw Dr. Reichman each time I went for an office visit. Dr. Reichman was also very responsive to emails. Any questions we had, we could email him directly and he would respond quickly. Dr. Elias comes across as an evidence driven Doctor. Being in the healthcare field myself this was a very valuable quality in a Doctor. He has always been respectful and tends to take calculated risks.All the staff knew my name. The doctor remembered my history without having to read from notes.Dr Reichman was present in my exams and did them himself unlike my prior Dr who was very difficult to talk to. The treatment was always personalized, clear and he took the time to answer all our questionsHe was amazing! Our flight was delayed which brought us into NYC after the clinic closed. He actually came back and took care of us at like 8 pm. He tailored my meds. He also called after each chemical pregnancy and talked me through everything.He had a very humane approach to infertility treatment, and even though there were many reasons to suggest donor eggs, he emphasized that I had never done an IVF cycle and that there were also many positive factors in our case.Cornell does things one particular way, and they all adhere to the same formula. While we liked Dr. Goldshlag, it was very rare that we'd actually see him when we went in for bloodwork and monitoring. The way Cornell works, you see whatever doctor is on the floor that day. To see your doc, you actually have to make an appointment. This causes all the other docs to not have any clue about your case, which is why I believe they follow the regimented way they do things so strictly. If you have any issues, or need them to think outside the box, this is not the place to go. In general however, if you simply want to try traditional IVF, Cornell is fine and I really liked him as a person.Cornell was very much like a bus station, you were a number and there was no specificity to the treatment. When we had trouble with the donor egg process working, there was no adjusting or figuring out what should be done differently, it was just applying their methods over and over again.He wasn't overly chatty, but he was very kind, clear, and compassionate. I have great respect for Dr. Pak Chung. I felt like a human. 
Dr Spandorfer takes time to explain everything. He is very easy going and personable. He was very nice, explained everything clearly, always asked if I had questions Max I had to wait was 15 mins to see Dr. Pereira. When I walked in, the entire staff knew my name as soon as I walked through the entrance door. Any time I had any questions outside of the office, I would email Dr. Pereira and he would reply within 12 hours - most of the time getting a response within 3 hours. Dr Goldschlag always answers my questions and never makes me feel rushed. He definitely makes you feel like you are in the best hands. I personally feel like he’s an angel here on earth. most of my appointment are on time.The nurses were kind and very patient with my questions. They responded to every e-mail and telephone message. The doctor also kind and understanding.Very communicative, professional, good listener.I asked a question regarding our transfer and treatment and he got irritated and refused to answer. He got up and walked out of the room (while I was still undressed laying on the table) shaking his head and rolling his eyes. Caring, honest, personable, shared small talk about life outside of fertilityDr. Reichman was very sure of how he would treat the issue we had.  He patiently answered all our questions in his office and also via emails, treated well and delivered results!Dr. spandorfer is very kind and very blunt.  He does not sugarcoat anything.  I trusted him completely.  he called us each time we miscarried to see how we were Practice is very process - driven, limited engagement with primary doctor after you set protocol for the cycle. The nurses are responsible for the day to day interaction with the patients. I felt like a human because of the experiences I had communicating with Hey-Joo and things she remembered and questions she would ask me. Dr spandorfer was very responsive, honest and caring.  The nurses I had were wonderful and warm.  The clinic is very cold but you get to know a few nice people.  Spent a lot of time with patients going through the ultrasounds and bloodwork.  Always called at night when he said he would.Dr Chung is an amazing doctor. My first retrival didn't go as planned . Dr Chung stuck with me every step of the way and made me feel like he truly cared.Dr. Reichman is empathetic, transparent, and realistic. Nursing staff was amazing. Always called back and took time answering questions. Doctors also took time to answer questions. Dr. Kang was incredible in making sure that I felt very comfortable with my treatment plan.  There was a period of time when I was panicked that we would have to cancel a cycle and she personally called me at 10pm to go over our options.  When I did great pregnant and she released me from her care, she got tears in her eyes.  Dr. Chung always knew the details of my case without having to obviously refer to his notes.  He engaged in discussions about more than just the treatment so we got to know him and he got to know us.  He always greeted us with a big warm hello when he came in. Dr. Davis had amazing bedside manner was always up-to-date on my status.  He was also very diligent returning calls or emails  Compassion and plenty of time givenHe would site info from my records and took time with me wasn't ever rushed Caring and straight forwardHe always treated me with kindnessHe doesn't answer questions to a patients understanding but gets the job doneHe didn't know my name.  He barely took the time to answer my questions.  She was very pleasant, up front, and comforting. The only downside is that they're always running late and each appointment I've waiting over an hour to be seen. Owen Davis is amazing. He treats every patient with respect and takes the time to explain every step of the process.  He is also responsive by phone or email.Dr. Owen Davis is a marvelous doctor. He is brilliant and kind to boot. He answers all questions via email or phone. He is a gem.She sat down with my regularly, answered emails and ALWAYS returned every call i made to her personally.   We had discussions about what was best and she said I could always continue she would support whatever we wanted to do.Dr. Pfeifer was informative and honest in our consultation, albeit a little dry. She clearly had a somewhat rehearsed bit covering the process, facts and statistics however, I felt like she answered all of my questions realistically, based on research and facts while also keeping in mind my personal situation. At the end of the day, a good doctor will give you the most accurate information to make the right decision for you. Fertility is such a unique process for everyone so a doctor who balances research with personal circumstances and health is what I wanted and got with Dr. Pfeifer.He takes his time with every appointment to make sure you understand all the possibilities before making any decisions. We decided to use IVF due to a genetics reason & it was one of the best decisions we've ever made. Also knowing that moving forward we'll have young healthy embryos, is very reassuring. He responded so promptly to all our emails even if outsides of business hours. Sometimes even calling us himself with results before the nurses line. This made us feel so comfortable and at ease with this whole experience.  Our retrieval, genetic testing of embryos & our transfer. Dr. Nigel Pereira is the most brilliant, compassionate, professional and accessible physician my husband or I has ever seen. He and his staff were always accessible, calling immediately after each and every test. Dr. Pereira helped us get pregnant the first cycle he treated us. When we miscarried, after having ""graduated"" from Dr. Pereira's care, he called us immediately, on the weekend, from his vacation to review possible causes, next steps and to extend his sympathies. I have an auto-immune disease and have an intimate relationship with hospitals and physicians--never have I met anyone as caring or capable as Dr. Nigel Pereira. Dr. Pereira is brilliantly smart, empathetic, humble, dedicated, friendly and frankly, all around spectacular.  He is passionately interested in his patients treatment, works diligently to find solutions and provide individualized care/protocol.  He has the most outstanding combination of intellectual intelligence with emotional intelligence which I believe enables successful and assuring outcomes. Dr. Pereira always took time to educate us on the process so we could make smart decision for ourselves with his guidance and support each step of the way.  He spent hours answering my questions directly, realistic and honestly (never felt like I was getting fluffy answers) while still maintaining outstanding bedside manner, optimism and transparency.  Dr. Melnick herself is very understanding and warm and responds to all questions thoroughly and with compassion.While there is an insane number of patients at this clinic and most of the NYC metro area ones, I felt like anything that concerned me was taken care of. Dr Davis was always very attentive to my questions and concerns. He’s a very busy doctor, but shows total focus on his patients during consultations, exams, etc. finally he was also always available during  critical momentsDr Zev Rosenwaks is a quiet man but a genius that knows what he’s doing and gave me my three children.  He gets the job done.  He’s amazing, he’s a genius!  My twins are 16 & my oldest is 19 and I so blessed to be their mother.  I thank God & Dr Rosenwaks.  I tried at other facilities in Long Island and it didn’t work.  I’m so grateful that my sister-in-law was working at Weill Cornell at the time & she referred me.  It was a hard, emotional time (hormones were all out of whack) but that’s a distance memory!  I can’t go by the hospital without getting emotional and feeling a warm, happy feeling if joy.  Dr Reichman is very empathetic, it's a unique quality to find in a true scientist. He is also very communicative, open, honest and straight forward. When you leave the appointment he gives you confidence that he will find the best outcome. When I first met Dr. Pereira, he took his time to explain all scenarios and got to know me a little, which was really nice.  Anytime I saw him in passing, he always said hello by my name and always asked how I was doing. Dr. Pereira and his professional staff showed great compassion, care and patience.Like a human. Dr. Rony Elias, is very profesional and warm doctor. Very polite and always greeter me by my name. His staff are very friendly and efficient, they are fast and on point. As six sigma profeaional their process is great.  I felt like a human because he genuinely cares and is compassionate about the issues I’m going through and how hard it is and he made the process easier by answering all my questions and concerns. His bedside manner was impeccable.Dr Elias answers all my questions and takes the time to explain things to me. He is kind and patient. Dr. Melnick never rushed me and was always available to answer all of my questions.We tried several time but couldn’t make it. He said that He would do whatever he can do. It was impressive and encouraging us.Wasn't overly friendly but wasn't rude. Didn't feel totally neglected but not personalized experience Dr. Kang is one of the kindest, most patient and caring doctors I've ever had the opportunity to work with.  During the entire process of my IVF treatment, I felt empowered simply due to her keen and extremely detailed explanations of each step.  We were always able to get in contact with her and she was always ready to answer any of my questions, or address my concerns.  I never felt pressured or rushed.  When we realized my IVF failed, she cried with me! 
I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Kang!Dr. Hey Joo Kang has an exceptional bedside manner.  She explained everything thoroughly and took the time to answer all our questions.  She was very candid and delivered good and not so great news in a delicate manner.  I was very pleased with her.Could not ask for a more compassionate doctor. He geared treatment to my needs and side effects of medications Personable
Asked how I am doing and genuinely wanted to know
Very personable staff
Dr Kang was always approachable, kind, positive, and realistic. He made me feel like a person that what I was doing or how is feel mattered Good bedside mannerDr. Pereira always treated me with respect and care. He took the time to answer my questions and explain why he was recommending certain treatments, never rushing me out. Perhaps most importantly, he acknowledged the difficulty and stress inherent to this process, a simple validation that went a long way. With Dr Pereira, we had a refreshing change in the way we were treated than our previous clinic. From the very day first day, he was very warm and friendly and listened to our problems with patience.  Dr Pereira never failed to show excellent bedside manners during all our visits and was also very sensitive in conveying news that our first 2 cycles were not positive. He never treated us like a number and even suggested us to not redo the same tests which were done on us by the previous clinic a short while ago.From the beginning, it was clear that Dr. Reichman was invested in us as a couple and would do everything in his power to help us grow our family. He was always honest, warm and empathetic.  We found comfort in his words, even those that were difficult to hear, and we viewed him as our third teammate in our fertility journey.  I had a wonderful experience with Dr. Pereira and his team.  His bedside manner and demeanor are lovely, and he intently listens to and answers all questions - no matter how silly or insignificant they might seem!  Even though Dr Pereira has a lot of patients to see each day, he will always take the time to explain the process, answer questions. He's very compassionate and kind. I always felt at ease at each appointment.Dr. Reichman and his entire medical team made me feel very comfortable and were accommodating. I never felt like a number. In fact, I really enjoyed going to the downtown location, and contrary to what I thought IVF would be, I felt at ease and not scared.From the first time I/we (my husband and I) sought treatment at fertility clinic we felt a high degree of professionalism from the staff and doctors. Our doctor (David Reichman M.D.) was friendly, kind and very informative from day 1. We felt everything and the entire process that unfolded step by step was explained in detail and there were supports in place for answers to all our questions. We enjoyed our experience at the fertility clinic and have so much respect, gratitude and admiration for Dr. Reichman-he is a brilliant doctor and a good person all around. I can't say enough positive things about Dr. Pereira or his staff.   Dr. Pereira is a special doctor, and one of the rare ones whose bedside manner equally parallels his incredible expertise.   I have never felt so important and cared for as a patient, and I think Dr. Pereira's regular communication and quick responses to my inquiries, has a lot to do with it.  During my time as Dr. Pereira's patient, I underwent emergency surgery for ovarian torsion. Dr. Pereira did not skip a beat making sure I was properly cared from the initial testing, to understanding my options, to answering my call at the crack of dawn when I knew I was in need of emergency surgery.  I felt really lucky to have a gynecological surgeon, who was also a fertility specialist, in charge of my care, because I knew he would ensure my fertility future was well taken care of.  He really is the best doctor, and it was bittersweet 'graduating' from his practice. Can not recommend him enough.  From the moment my husband and I met Dr Pereira, we really liked him. He is not only knowledgeable, but incredibly warm and compassionate and always made me feel like a priority, which was especially important after I suffered an additional miscarriage while under his care. He never made me feel like a number and treated my case specifically based on my medical history. If I ever had any questions for Dr P, he would email or give me a call even after hours. He is a wonderful person and the best doctor I have ever had. The care was warm, patient and kind. I was always able to speak to someone and Dr Pereira was available for us at all times, often calling us personally with results or for follow up.The physician is compassionate, empathetic, yet confident.  He takes his time with you and explains every detail step by step.  He makes it a point to know his patients and reach the best solution to each situation with them.  He guided my husband and I regarding insurance coverage and what would be the best option for us not to get overwhelmed with financial responsibility.  It's not about the money for him Monitoring hours are difficult for everyone involved. I'm not sure if anything can be done about these procedures (whether the lab can push back their hours), but it's early in the morning, there's a packed waiting room full of women being called in large batches; it feels like a cattle call. Dr. Reichman is slightly more brusque and rushed during monitoring hours (understandably so). He is patient enough to answer all questions, but there's a lot of pressure and urgency to get undressed, dressed, and ask questions efficiently and succinctly.I cannot recommend Dr. Pereira highly enough. The whole experience exceeded our expectations and we truly felt like we were given all the necessary information in a timely and clear manner. All of our questions were answered and we were never left wondering. We felt as if we were the only patient in his care despite what I'm sure was many. His nurse Crystal was also a complete joy who was always so prompt in her response and super positive and kind. Every interaction even if it was not great news was a pleasure and so professionally handled. He was just so kind and attentive.  He gave me his email on the first appointment and was true to his word in responsiveness.  He also listened without judgment and just made me feel like he was in this journey with me.Dr. Reichman has been absolutely wonderful- he both has a warm bedside manner, but is also honest, very informative, and provides realistic expectationsDr. REichman was absolutely fantastic and always made me feel like he knew me. He was always incredibly patient and took his time to understand my situation and explain things thoroughly.  He remembered my particular situations and was always sensitive to them. Dr. Pereira always took the time to answer our questions and we never felt rushed.  He also would answer emails immediately and would get me in whenever I needed.  There was never a long wait.  In our first appointment he spent a lot of time explaining what our options are and what was going on in a detailed way and had a power point presentation which helped us understand the process and the steps we needed to move forward. Dr. Pereira and his staff always called me by name and were patient and sympathetic with my questions and concerns. Dr Pereira was extremely patient during each appointment. I never felt rushed, and he was very attentive to answering any questions or concerns I had. The first time my husband came to an appointment, he was greeted by name, and made to feel very comfortable.From the moment I met Dr. Pereira, I completely trusted him and felt comfortable.  He has a great sense of humor and explained the issues and options in detail.  Each time he saw me he greeted me by name and chatted with me.We are forever grateful to the wonderful Dr. Pereira!  We came to him after switching from a different clinic in NJ where we had two failed IVF cycles.  Dr. Pereira immediately noticed that our medicine dosages had been completely incorrect, along with incorrect timing of trigger shot resulting in poor quality eggs.  Not only did Dr. P reinstate our hope in ever having children, but he thought that we should give an IUI a chance because our original diagnosis of poor morphology was potentially not as bad as initially thought.  Dr. P’s instinct was spot on because our very first IUI with him worked!  Aside from our miracle we felt confident that he is a doctor who would always know what to do next when unexpected outcomes come up, and his incredible knowledge and confidence was obvious.  Not to mention, he is an all-around awesome guy (and funny too)!  We will definitely be back to him (if we need) for baby number 2 and HIGHLY recommend him to anyone struggling with incompetent doctors and a complex fertility case.Dr. Pereira is simply amazing, as a doctor & a human. He is one of the most compassionate and professional doctors i have ever worked with and has amazing bedside manner. Not only did he answer all of my questions via email, phone and at the office, but every appointment was thoughtful and considerate. I never felt rushed or as if my questions were unnecessary. Furthermore, his care was extremely on-point, professional and helpful in every way. I was sad to ""graduate"" from his care after i got pregnant and wish that he could have been my doctor throughout my pregnancy. 

Dr. Pereira and his staff were available constantly, there was never a time that I was unable to reach someone, get an answer to a question, or make an appointment for follow-up. They took time to answer all questions and never made me feel like I was bothering them or being too ""needy.""We have always received personal attention from Dr. P and all his staff. 
He always had answers to our problems and clear solutions to the options and next steps to follow within the infertility treatment/process.  Dr. Elias doesn't only care about the medical process he goes through, he also support his patients emotionally before starting any treatment or procedure.Familiarity with my particular case, where I was at in my cycle, friendly and optimistic but realistic treatment.Dr. Pereira was always so kind and thoughtful and took the time to thoroughly explain things and answer questions.He was compassionate, caring and was always available to answer any questions or assist in anyway.  He also gave me a much greater understanding into PCOS and after a few months I was able to get pregnant. Dr. Elias was the third doctor I encountered in the process while freezing my eggs. The first was NYU. The second was a private clinic in Providence, RI not associated with Women and Infants. I had low reserve. The private clinic in Providence told me I would never get pregnant or have the ability to freeze my eggs. Dr Elias was an amazing, brilliant and compassionate doctor. He told me I still had a chance to get pregnant and better yet he would successfully freeze my eggs. He did not give me false hope. I successfully froze ten. I am now on my way to using those eggs now. Dr. Pereira was understanding, patient, warm, and took the time to answer our questions and get to know our needs.",8.800000000000027,8.40000000000005,"Dr Reichman is an exceptionally intelligent, patient and compassionate doctor, who somehow balances his deep wealth of knowledge with incredible humanity, kindness and humor. Given how painful the fertility journey can be, we couldn't imagine getting through it without a doctor who cared as much as he did. Dr. Reichman is the best Doctor I have ever had in any capacity. Throughout the IVF process I truly felt like he was on my team and was always concerned about my general well being throughout. Dr. Reichman watched my cycle for a month and then we decided to proceed with another retrieval and fresh transfer. I would recommend Dr. Reichman to ANYONE dealing with infertility. If you are considering or on the fence 100% absolutely use her!From the initial consultation to the multiple medicated IUIs and the egg retrieval and fresh embryo transfers, Dr Schattman explained everything thoroughly, and took his time to answer all my questions in a kind-hearted but educated way. I don’t know where to begin with explaining how incredible Dr. Elias is in practice and in general. He never misled me but presented me with the facts and statistics for my age and situation. He was knowledgeable, thorough and methodical, and made tweaks in our treatment to find the best fit which ultimately led to a successful pregnancy. Since I was diagnosed with PCOS on my first visit to him, he assumed that the problem was me and therefore did not recommend that my husband get tested as well. Early on (maybe our first meeting), she told us that she likes to take the stress off of her patients and that they will be monitoring all of my hormones, etc.. I think she made this statement after I had asked about or shown my ovulation testing (urine strips vs. temperature). He (jokingly) got offended when I went to the UES location because he likes to be sure he's available to his patients throughout the process. I feel Dr. Elias is very knowledgeable and I trusted him completely with my care. He always takes as much time with you as you need to ask questions. Goldschlag is personable when you he sees you in person and is very patient. I would 100% recommend him if he had a different staff. He was always exact in his findings and explained things in a way that a non-medical professional can understand. Dr Schattman was great and really has a strong grasp of all different scenarios related to IUI/IVF. Dr. Reichman was great about taking over my case and helping me feel like I wasn't alone in my struggles. I had had a bad experience with a previous clinic in that I never was able to get a clear answer about what my tests indicated about my prognosis, unfortunately trusting that they had my best interest in mind. In less than a week I had all the information I needed to make an informed decision that put my mind at ease, unlike the previous clinic that strung me along (taking thousands of dollars for worthless procedures). While our interaction with Dr. Spandorfer during our fresh cycle was fairly limited (due to Cornell's pooled monitoring/procedure method), I felt like he was reachable if I had any questions and knew that he was the one reviewing my file daily and making the important calls. When our first cycle was successful but ended in a miscarriage, Dr. Spandorfer showed much more compassion than I expected for a doctor at a high volume fertility clinic (and more than I had gotten from any of my regular obgyns in the past) and became our single point of contact for all future appointments and procedures. He seems like a top doctor, an expert - and a human being - which is the ideal combination in this profession I think. He listened to me and understood what we were trying to achieve and came up with the best course of action to achieve it. Weaknesses: During what was the most painful (physically and emotionally) time - during my ectopic pregnancy - he hardly checked in on me, I felt totally in the dark, he was very cavalier about surgery vs. drugs to remove, and once the surgery was over didn't call to check up on me that night or the next day. And by work with me I mean he was willing to do an egg retrieval and insemination and a transfer even with very few eggs produced by stimulation -- which by the way I had gotten from other doctors with various mixes of medication so I think it was inevitable .I was referred to Dr. Kang by a friend, and I will be forever grateful to her. And he treated me like an individual -- I always felt as though I had very personal care. He did a great job stimulating me and getting lots of eggs. I was very happy with the doctor's approach with my wife. He was realistic and guided me to measure my expectations. Dr. Reichman is not the most outwardly warm doctor; however, he takes the time to get to know each patient and develop a relationship with them. Reichman is extremely knowledgeable and professional. He is very straightforward and compassionate at the same time. Reichman is a kind and passionate doctor. Dr. Melnick made me feel comfortable from my very first appointment which was a consultation and physical examination. I never felt like a number and her attention to detail goes above and beyond. He is quick to address inquiries via email and he makes sure his nurses have everything they need to fully support patients. I had a wonderful experience with Dr. Pereira and his team. He is a phenomenal doctor, smart and precise. I can't say enough positive things about Dr. Pereira or his staff. He is prompt and thorough, yet he takes his time to make sure that you understand every aspect of the situation. He is very knowledgeable, caring and trustworthy. Furthermore, his care was extremely on-point, professional and helpful in every way. I am beyond grateful and cannot say enough positive things about Dr. Pereira and my experience here. He went out of his way to come uptown to take care of our second transfer (on a day that he was not on call) and this transfer worked!While Dr. Rosenwaks is quite blunt and not very delicate, you can tell how much passion he has for his work and you as a patient. I really felt like I was dealing with a completely different Doctor. Dr. Reichman took the time to ask me exactly what I wanted out of the process and tailored a plan specifically for me, and treated me with precise care each visit Dr. Melnick and her team are very warm and very efficient. This was very hurtful considering A. She told me this not in her office but while I was crossing a busy intersection on the phone and B. She had not done any comprehensive tests on me and my husband. Understood my reasons for pursuing egg freezing but did not do a hard sell - if anything she was adamant about me deciding to do so because I wanted rather than because of the scare tactics in stats, graphs, etc for fertility viability in women after 35. He knows that I am a healthcare professional and brings it up regularly, in explanation for decisions and for why he is explaining things to me in a scientific way. Goldschlag is a very kind doctor and will answer any questions, but you have to ask the questions or your time with him is limited and not filled with much information. However, the clinic and the process for making appointments and getting in touch with the doctor's staff can make you feel like a number. Hundreds of women come for monitoring and appointments every day. Dr. Schlegel and his staff are incredibly compassionate and very responsive. He is truly a caring doctor as well as being brilliant. Dr. Schattman is warm, honest and optimistic without creating  my false expectations. Kligman's team were very responsive to my questions, requests for information, etc, and all of my care felt like it was based on a real analysis of my needs, not a cookie cutter med protocol. We had discussions about what was best and she said I could always continue she would support whatever we wanted to do. Fertility is such a unique process for everyone so a doctor who balances research with personal circumstances and health is what I wanted and got with Dr. Pfeifer. Dr. Elias doesn't only care about the medical process he goes through, he also support his patients emotionally before starting any treatment or procedure."
29,Weill Cornell Medical College,advice,"Go to a more experienced Doctor Trust what he says. He truly cares about you as a patient and person and knows what he is doing.Book you initial consult now. We had a 10 week wait to get our initial meeting with Dr Reichman but I'm glad that didn't deter us. Once you are Dr Reichman's patient he is very responsive, and availability isn't an issue. Advocate for yourself. Dr. Reichman is incredibly smart. If your requests are substantiated, he will compromise with you on reasonable grounds.Be prepared with your questions during your initial consultation. Do your own research also as to what IVF is. Be an advocate for yourself - if you don't understand something or want to discuss something with him don't be afraid to do so. Come prepared with questions and research. Go prepared to ask a lot of questions, and do not expect hand holding. I thought I didn't need personalized attention if I was seeing someone with incredible research chops, but discovered that this is a more emotional process than I realized.Don't be afraid to ask questions. He answers every single one of them without making you feel rushed or that it's a silly question.He can be blunt with the reality of things, but he does care about you getting success and knows his stuff. If you want someone with a super compassionate bedside manner he may not be the one for you, but he certainly takes his work seriously and is always positive yet realistic. If you are paying out of pocket, he also understands the great cost of IVF and takes that into account when recommending next steps, which I really appreciate. Be your own advocate.  Do your research and be well prepared for your consult and appointments.  You will need to speak up for yourself and not be afraid to ask questions about your plan of treatment.Be aware that you will probably never see him in person again after your initial consult. He was available by phone as was consistent in returning phone calls and I never felt rushed in our conversations. Dr. Rosenwaks is very matter-of-fact about plans and fertility protocols. But he will answer any question you have. Do not hesitate to ask anything you have questions about, or his opinion on something you heard or read. He will be honest about his thoughts. Even though he no longer performs procedures himself, he is the director of the clinic and has put together an incredible staff of doctors, nurses and fellows who have an incredibly high standard to achieve in working with him. She’s very to the point. She does not waste your time. She will give you options from the start and proceed with treatment quickly.Trust the process. I had a lot of confidence in Dr. Reichman, but I think it is important for other patients to know that he is on top of everything. Dr. Reichman is very smart, so don’t be intimidated and scared to ask him questions. If you are too nervous to ask him in person than email him directly. He will respond. Trust him and the process - he knows exactly what he is doing. Trust Dr. Reichman! 
Ask for explanations for decisions, but don't question his method.Don't be afraid to ask questions - he is very easy to talk to. Just be patient!!!! Not everything will happen in your first round but she knows what she is doing!He will make you feel comfortable, so ask any questions you need.Trust your Doctor and ask questions he will answer all of them. I had to go through many procedures with Dr Pereira and other two doctors/clinics but all the procedures Dr. Pereira did were so much less painful. 

He will arrange everything so quickly its unbelievable. My husband had to meet urologist and the appointment was weeks away but he called and arranged appointment in few days.  Trust him and feel comfortable asking him anything!  He is truly the most wonderful person, if you are having any issues emotional, physical tell him and he will take that into consideration.  I am VERY afraid of needles so the blood draws were not fun for me -- after telling him he would ensure that if that blood test wasn't 100% necessary I didn't have to take it. 
Also, ask him anything because once you do you will feel better - he has a way about him of just putting you at ease, no matter what the response is! Don't be afraid to ask stupid questions. See someone else. Ask as many questions as possible. Dr.Reichman is extremely knowledgeable and I think educating yourself throughout this process is helpful in many ways.Always arrive early! He has a lot of patients so you will find yourself waiting for a long time if you don't get there as soon as they open. Also, don't be afraid to ask as many questions as possible. He will not shy away from giving you direct answers.Do yourself a major favor, call NOW to book an appointment with him! And my one piece of advice for any patient with any doctor is to become informed about the process.The IUI/IVF process is confusing, and you can only ask the right questions if you are knowledgeable about your different treatment options. Dr. Reichman always had time to answer my questions and concerns, but it was on me to become my own advocate capable of making the right decisions for me and my family once he laid out all the information.Demand eye contact. Trust the process. Cornell and Dr Reichman have a very well thought out process that worked perfectly for us. If he recommends something, take that seriously. He doesn’t just throw things out, everything is deliberate. Don't hesitate to ask questions. He is very patient and easy to talk to. Write down any questions you have before meeting with him, morning monitoring with him goes quickly, as it should, so it helps to be prepared. I think she is a very smart doctor, she is very straightforward, maybe too blunt for the liking of some people.  I feel like she does not deviate from Cornell's playbook.You may not get a lot of time with him so come prepared and don't be afraid to answer questions.Weill Cornell is a huge clinic so your one on one time with Dr Reichman will be limited (unless you've booked a specific hour long appointment to talk over things in depth.) Don't let that distract you from the fact that he's 100% professional and kind - and will be very honest with you about your potential success rates. Ask all the questions you need to in order to feel comfortable with the series of tests, treatments, medicine, etc. Dr Pereira is patient and very willing to make sure you have all the information you need.You are in good hands.Trust him! This process can be scary and overwhelming at times but you can rely on him to guide you through it each step of the way. Don't be afraid to ask him questions, take comfort in the fact that he is an expert and know that he really wants you to have success and he will do everything he can to make it happen for you. Believe in him!While he is not very delicate in his approach to care, know he cares, is always working for the good of his patients, and is at the top of his practice with respect to his approach to treatment. If you have a tough case and his protocol didn't work for the first time, I would think very hard about staying with him.  Get a second opinion.  
Be prepared with questions when you meet with him.   He can be very intimidating sometimes but you need to be your own advocate. See him!Trust his judgement. Though it can of course be helpful to do your own research or talk to other women about IVF, I honestly never took anyone else's advice over his. If you have a question, no matter how silly, ask it and he will answer. Don't be afraid to voice your concerns or questions as he is very willing to listen and give an explanation in layman's terms. Don't be afraid to ask him questions or give him your opinion on research you found, etc.  He really takes the time to address your concerns so that you can understand his protocol, etc.  He's happy to repeat himself though if you don't understand what he says the first time.  If you’re results oriented and respond to data and a logic-based approach, he’s your guy. Book an appointment as soon as possible!Do your reserach before seeing him to understand potential outcomes, alternatives and questions to ask. He will competently answer all, but not necessarily offer excess info.Choose him as your doctor. Have a list of questions prepared, because you will get every single one answered!
Dr. Elias is more than happy to share his knowledge - ask questions!Ask questions! He seems willing to discuss and give info about any questions I have- I just need to be prepared with them :) Know what you want out of the experience, ask lots of questions because Dr. P will take the time to answer them. Be honest with Dr. Pereira. To a prospective patient of Dr. Pak Chung, I would say ""don't be afraid to ask many questions"".  Dr. Chung is the type of doctor who appreciates questions and has the patience and knowledge to answer them well.  Be mindful that she is not always available and you will need to see other doctors quite oftenIf you tend to ask questions and advocate for yourself do not work with him. He is not warm and fuzzy, but he is thoughtful and reasonable. If you are looking for hand holding, he is not for you.  But his knowledge and his confidence are very impressive. get your husband tested on the first visit even if he doesnt recommend itTribeca office is closed on weekends and holidays so sometimes have to go to Upper East Side location for monitoring which is much larger, less welcoming than the Tribeca office. Dr. Reichman did not perform any of my IUI's, egg retrieval or transfer procedures- depends on who is on call when they are scheduled. Ask a lot of questions and try to prepare for your appointments in advance because he sees a lot of patients. Go in for monitoring appointments on the earlier side (before 8am) if you want to get seen without any wait. Put your faith in him and do as he says and stay off of Google! Trust him and do what he says!Morning appointments have always been really easy to get in and out for me and come with specific questions to ask as your meeting with her will be quick.The clinic is busy and they talk fast.  Be prepared with questions for each visit with her, or you can call & talk to her assistant (Diana) or the nursing staff.  Especially when it's your first cycle I feel like you need to do this or you may wish later on you'd done things differently (it's expensive you want to maximize your odds of success each round).I would write down all the questions I want to ask and give him a call.  
He will try to explain and navigate.  Don't hesitate to ask him everything you wish for. He will find a way if he can. I believe he's truly a good person beside his doctor qualifications. Make an appointment today. Get on the waitlist. Do not waste any time trying on your own or with other doctors.Stick to the plan he recommends. Unlike other fertility docs, he never ever take the shortest route. Even if in that moment all you want is a positive pregnancy test, trust that a longer road will yield better resultsCome prepared with your questions and ask! I found him to not say too much - only the basics are necessary info - for anything else you need to ask him.Take him, without a second thought. He approaches his patient's problems as they are his own. Dr Elias is great. Just listen to his advice! Make sure you can have a consultation with Dr. Reichman to go through your entire medical history so he can accurately asses. Trust that he wants the best for you.Feel free to over communicate your symptoms and don't shy from asking him a lot of questions -- he's more than willing to help answer them.Just go see him. And if you're a morning person get to monitoring early you’ll be in and out very quickly. Dr. Reichman is very matter of fact, reality-based, and straightforward. For us, these qualities were decisive factors in becoming his patient and placing our trust in him. Talk to him about your fertility goals and he will build an intelligent strategy with you  -- he will give you the facts without giving you false hope. Also attend your monitoring appointments with all your questions ready to go! Come with questions prepared.  He is very busy.  He will sit with you as long as you have questions but he doesn't have time to waste so make sure you know what you want to ask in advance.Share all medical information so that Dr. Pereira can create the best fertility plan to meet your needs. When meeting with Dr. Pereira feel free to ask any questions to help put your mind at ease. Follow his plan, take a couple of months on the front end, and allow Dr. Pereira to create the best course of action based on your expectations and financial abilities. Listen to him. He knows what he's talking about. Explain your concerns and let him guide you. Be on time for your appointments. I was always taken on time and most of the time earlier than my scheduled appointment. He's usually very promptTrust trust trust trust him and at first, you don't succeed, don't give up. Trust him. I completely trusted him and don't be afraid to ask questions.  If you are not well versed in medical jargon or fertility jargon, ask lots of questions.  Dr. Pereira will explain each term and plan of action.  Sometimes he needs to be prompted. Ask everything you want to know, he will answer everything calmly, explain every step and will make sure you have all the answers before you go. He never lets you feel like he is too busy. Take notes because she takes fast!Always go to the Tribeca office for monitoring. You'll get Dr. Reichman as opposed to the revolving door of doctors at the UES location.She will not always do all procedures, and there were one or two times where things she said made me think she'd be doing a procedure or be the doctor I'd see for a visit and then it ended up being one of the other doctors.Find someone more experienced Know that you get the facts along with a person who genuinely cares about your success. Dr. Pfeifer is easy to talk with, ask questions and she volunteers information. Come prepared with questions. I found writing them down or noting them in my phone made it easy to make sure I didn't forget anything. Make sure to ask for the follow-up steps for this cycle, as well as what you should do if the cycle is unsuccessful. If the cycle is unsuccessful, you will have to be proactive in making your next appointment on the right day and ordering any medicines to ensure that you have them on the day that you need them. There really isn't a lot of follow-up in between cycles, maybe because they have some veteran patients, so after my first cycle, I was a bit disoriented as far as next steps.
I wished I could have became more familiar with basics of the IVF treatment and  anatomy on a female reproductive system so that I could have used the limited time more effectively.  If you are seeing Dr Periera for IUI, he will not be performing the procedure itself.  While Dr Periera is great, Cornell on the other hand was not the best.Be proactive and ask questions. He has no problem explaining things in a way you can understand.Be open about your fears, concerns, questions, etc...Understand that it is a big clinic and that you won’t see Dr. Goldschlag unless you personally ask for him.Have faith, and even though the clinic itself is very crowded and impersonal, know that an experts eyes are monitoring you daily and in charge of tour cycle and outcome. Don't be afraid to ask questions. DO YOUR HOMEWORK and make sure you ask for as much info as possible.  Silly things, like getting on a prenatal as you start treatment were never disclosed.  You really have to ask for the things you need with OD, cause it will not be volunteered.  He is not a bad human and I think he cares about what he does.  But again, too many clients and a slightly large ego makes him a bit tricky.If you aren't getting typical results, move on to another clinic, or even a reproductive immunologist.  You won't get a rigorous scientific examination of your results.Give him a chance to get to know you before  you assume he is too quiet or hands off. Once I got to know him a little better and we were all able to relax around each other, it got much easier. 
Prepare questions in advance of an initial consultation or longer follow-up appointment. Morning monitoring appointments are very quick and didn't allow much time for in-depth conversation, though he never made me feel rushed and answered any questions I had then too. Email him directly any time you have additional questions. He typically responded to my emails in less than 24 hours.Be your own advocate with the nurses. Get the plan from dr Davis and question the nurses if they are incorrect or if it was different than the plan dr Davis mentioned.Feel free to ask questions.  If you aren't getting helpful enough information from the nurses, you can call Dr. Pfeifer's assistant for an appointment with her.  I have never walked away from a consultation wondering what to do or what was going on.  Don't wait!  I waited a bit to go to a fertility doctor because I did not want to be pressured into ivf.   But, that was not my experience at all with Dr. Goldschlag.  I wish I had seen him sooner so I can understand what is going on with my body.  My only other advice is to ask a lot of questions.  He gives a good explanation of your fertility plan, but the steps you need to take such as when to get blood work, when to take the drugs, and etc..  sometimes needs to be clarified. He is blunt at times - some people might not like this, but I really do. I want to know the good and the bad, with nothing sugar coated. If patients have worries about treatment or symptoms during treatment I recommend framing the question to Dr. Reichman as “this is happening - is this because of the fertility treatment or does this pose a challenge or risk to my cycle?”. Dr. Reichman is not a primary care physician so if any symptoms are not a result of, or will impact fertility treatment he will direct you to your regular doctor.If you want to try something other than what Dr Elias suggests, bring it up - you don’t always need to follow his advice. He is pretty amenable to doing what you want at the end of the day. He was even willing to work with a reproductive immunologist (Dr Braverman) and make changes to the ivf protocol that I suggested. If you find yourself overwhelmed by science or statistics, don't be afraid to ask questions.  He will respond with patience and kindness.I recommend him without hesitation.  Trust his advice and the process.Start your journey with Dr. Reichman, it will only get better. He is direct in his communication which in our view is very helpful. Go to him!Come prepared with your questions.  Dr. Reichman (and his office/practice) are extremely busy so you’ll get more out of your visits if you know exactly what you want to learn/know.  He’s fairly no-nonsense (while also compassionate) and I think appreciates when his patients arrive prepared.The morning monitoring sessions go quickly.  Do your research and have all your questions ready to go.  Weill Cornell is one of the best and therefore one of the busiest clinics. Dr. Pfeifer is a great doctor and you are in good hands. My advice is more in general about IVF: Be sure to have a lot of support from friends and family. Take time to nurture yourself, and educate yourself about IVF so you know what questions to ask. Take the time to educate yourself on what diet, exercise, lifestyle and supplement changes you can implement to improve egg quality because there is a lot you can do. ""The Infertility Cure"" and ""It Starts With The Egg"" are good resources. The CCRM fertility supplement list is also helpful.Come prepared with questions to avoid playing phone tag. Also, have patience because you will never get a live person on the phone. You have to leave a message and receive a call back. If answering the phone at your job is difficult,  this can feel very stressful. Be prepared for the atmosphere of the office. You feel like a number in a fast paced factory and that s just the way its gonna be.Be prepared with questions but also asking about the timing of each treatment plan.  Come prepared with questions--appointments go really quickly and Dr. Schattman will be in and out super quickly. He's not going to take 20 minutes to chit chat with you. if you have questions, make sure to have them ready to go when you see him. If you have any questions, even if you feel they are ""stupid"" questions, don't hesitate to ask. He will always answer. No question is stupid when dealing with infertility Be patient but forthcoming and direct with your questions and concerns.  
He will address anything you need to know but you will need to advocate/push for yourself as well.  Check with your insurance company regarding coverage in advance regarding coverage and pre-authorizations. He doesn't have a lot of time and always seems a bit rushed so have all your questions ready in advance.

Befriend his nurses and his office staff. They are fantastic and will get you the access you need to Dr Chung or answers to questions they themselves can answer. They run a tight ship. It seems like each of the doctors at Weill Cornell have their own support staff so the calibre of that team makes a big difference in your overall experience.Even though I had a wait a few months to see him, it ended up being worth it for me! I am glad we got the chance to work with him, so don't let that stop you from  going to him! Be patient and make sure you have questions ready when you do meet with her. Take the time to meet with him because you will not be disappointed. JUST GO SEE HIM! Don’t give up hope.  Dr. Elias will do whatever he can to help you.You have to be your own best advocate. Doctors have a lot of patients, i put myself in charge and made sure everything happening i was comfortable with. He is wonderful and truly tries to help you achieve your goal of pregnancy. Get to know your nurse. She can be of help to you as well. Also, be open with your questions. Dr. Reichman is there and willing to help. Trust Dr. Reichman! The process may itself seem daunting so adding an extra layer of worry wouldn't help. Nothing specific. Stay on top of your treatment.  No such thing as stupid questions. The good thing is Dr. Kang and her team are quick to answer all questions.Ask many questions and participate in actively in discussing and choosing appropriate protocol. If you can - have your retrieval done by drDavis - his hands are magic and I never had any pain or complications after he has done my procedure. Understand that despite the fact that Dr. Pfeifer is very personally invested in her patients, it is still up to you to be your own advocate as a patient, especially in a large practice like Cornell--ask questions, follow up with your nursing team and question things that just don't seem 'right' until you feel comfortable.Come in with a list of questions and refer to it during the appointment. You may also want to audio record the sessionsShow up informed, do your research under stand that treatment is both medical and lifestyle choices. Eat a healthy diet, take prenatals, maintain a heathy lifestyle.  I see many patients expecting too much, there is a lot that is in your control. You have to drive your own outcome and be productive with your treatment.I would tell a future patient to not expect that Dr Rosenwaks would ""hold your hand"" through the process and as hard as it is just to just simply trust him. He really does have the patients safety and interest first. He will get the job done.Don't wait any longer, see Dr. Reichman if you are having trouble conceiving. He is the best in his field.Be prepared to deal with a big facility type of feeling.  Make sure you know in advance what your protocol is.Be prepared to advocate for yourself and do a tremendous amount of independent research and legwork when it comes to all things related to your cycle including prior authorization, insurance coverage, billing and medications.Just know you won't see him all of the time - the doctors rotate for monitoring, retrievals, transfers etc. - not unlike many other clinics. Important to note that he will make himself available by phone whenever you need to speak to him.Dr. Kligman is a better communicator in person.  If possible, try to see him vs talking to him on the phone.Come prepared with a list of questions and be ready to get straightforward answersDon’t hesitate to make an appointment with him and take his advice on a plan of action!Be prepared that you will not see Dr. G at every monitoring appointment. BUT, you can always schedule time with him.

Also, Dr. G takes a more cautious approach to treatment and protocols. If you are looking for an innovator or someone very aggressive, he may not be the right doctor for you.

WARRIOR REVIEWI don't have any advice. He's great because he's very accessible but also part of a state of the art practice. Make sure you ask questions. Based on my experience, he gets right to the point and doesn't oversaturate you with info, so if you are curious about something you have to ask on your own.I did not realize that I would need to go to the Upper East Side office so often - you have to go there for all procedures, classes and weekend monitoring. I moved to Westchester a few months ago and figured that everything would be in Westchester in the Mt. Kisco office, but that was not correct. That being said, I like having access to the Cornell team but able to see Dr. Elias in the Mt. Kisco office which is smaller and less intimidating and factory-like than the UES office.Keep your eye on the ultimate goal; he will do his best to get you there. Don't expect for her to spend a lot of time with you if you have no questions or concerns. However, if you do have questions or concerns she will make time for you and make sure you're comfortable with the information/procedures. I was a more ""go with the flow"" type of patient and didn't ask too many questions. Do not expect to have your hand held. Have a support system outside of Cornell and take comfort that you are being treated at one of the best clinics. When you have an appointment with Kligman have your questions ready and make the most of each visit. I never felt rushed during our appointments. Persistence is key when getting through to her directly. Due to the high volume nature of the clinic, you really have to be your own advocate as everyone is vying for time with her. Being in high demand is not a bad problem to have, but wish that Cornell would hire more physicians to lower the patient to provider ratio.Be proactive. Always ask questions if you have them and don't be shy to speak up if you have concerns. Know that you might not always see him for each visit. I have seen him most visits but he has not performed all the procedures, like the HSG. However, the other doctor I have seen has always been consistent so I do not feel like I'm rotating through the whole clinic. Look elsewhere.  Cornell on a whole doesn't have a great reputation.  No personal care.  I love my regualr ob/gyn there but the fertility practice is too big and factory-like.Don't expect to see him every time prepare to see and talk to mostly staff it's just how that clinic works. If at any point you're not clear on something just call the nurse and tell them. Sometimes they assume you understand when you don't just have to speak up.Do not be afraid to ask questions or ask for clarification.Be prepared with questions if you have them and if you are concerned about something, speak up. Trust him to know your case.  But also ask questions. Demand more explanations and updates. Ask questions! The visits move quickly and I needed to write down my questions as a mental reminder to ask before he leaves... Dr Davis is excellent with dealing with finished ovarian reserve. He is willing to try multiple stimulation options to achieve the best outcome possible. If you need to reach him during a call, call his amazing Assistant, and she will have him call you right back. You have to do some self-education and be prepared to ask questions and prompt him as he won't always be as effusive as you might want him to be.  He is 100% willing to spend all the time in the world with you discussing treatment and options but you should come prepared with a list of questions and concerns.  I would tell a prospective patient to be very clear with Dr. Goldschlag about your expectations and how soon or quickly you would like to proceed with specific treatments. He is very understanding and will move things along very quickly if that is what you prefer. He was very thorough in explaining all of my options and what the approximate timeline would be for every option. In my case, I was very clear that I wanted to move quickly and he immediately outlined my options based on my goals and expectations.Do not wait to make an appointment - if you want to see him, the sooner the better.Trust he is on top of your case and dont expect any hand holding. Write your questions down and ask them as she is doing the monitoring exams. Know as much as you can before you go in so you can play a more active role in deciding your treatment path.If you want to see him at daily monitoring then you can try to request him and if he's there he will see you. That helped me see him more often but he does travel through several offices so is not always in the upper east side office. Don't expect to have long appointments with her. Don't expect hand holding, have your questions lined up before you see him (write them down) and call when you feel uncomfortable or worried. Ask all your questions during your appointments, because you'll most likely speak to your nurse when you call, who will then have to call you back once she speaks to the doctor.Go see her! He is very informative and can give you lots of statistics off the top of his head.  Take notes to create a plan, as well as a back up plan, that you are comfortable with.  Be ready to clearly discuss your options and questions before going in thereafter.  Dr Davis  is a highly ranked fertility doctor, not a therapist (so don't expect lovely dovey emotional support and hand holding).  But do expect honesty and results consistent with the expectations he set.Speak to someone about how Cornell works and what to expect before going to this particular clinic for treatment. The doctors are great but the clinic definitely has a factory approach. Sometimes he speaks fast, but all you need to do is ask him to repeat himself, which he is happy to do!Ask questions, especially about cost.Be your own health advocate and ask detailed questions.Keep faith in the process and trust Dr Pfeifer's knowledge, expertise regarding the fertility treatment.Be on time. He talks fast so pay attention! He is very open so ask him anythingGo into it knowing that it's a busy practice and you may have to be very clear about your needs in order to get them fulfilled.Know that you will not see him at every visit which is typical of larger fertility clinics, however, he will call you back if you leave messages with his assistant.Ask all your questions during the consult, he won't rush you.  And he won't look at you like you're crazy.Know that Cornell is a bit of a factory so you need to be very assertive and proactive to have your needs met. Your main nurse is very important.Relax and go with the flow, realizing the clinic is very busy and can seem overwhelming while you wait each morning in the waiting room. Ask all of your questions. I might not recommend Dr. Schattman to someone that needs a lot of emotional support and hand holding throughout the process. Sometimes the odds are not great and he does not shy away from the truth and explains the myriad ways things can go wrong. If yours is a very clear-cut case, you'll be okay. If there's the slightest ambiguity, however, you would be better served by a different RE. Prepare your questions in advanced or your appointments. Know that he always follows up on email correspondence usually in less than 24 hours. Trust his instincts with your care, but don't be afraid to ask questions.Trust in his experience and in the process.  Be patient and know that his success rates are among the best in the world and you will get there if you stay the course. Ask all the questions you want; Dr. Goldshlag and his staff are happy to help you with any and all concerns that you might have.  Have a good PCP who is willing to help you on your IVF journey. Despite direct contact from my nurse team, I had some physicians that made it rather difficult to get medication on Dr. Goldshlag's recommendation.  Also, make sure you understand the billing, and that you get a list of CPT codes and procedures in the event that your insurance needs all this information. It is sometimes difficult to argue with insurance without the jargon in hand.Dr. Schlegel's opinions regarding male factor infertility and co-management with IVF will cost a pretty penny, but it is worth it considering he is one of the few experts in the field. I felt he genuinely cared for us and our situation and only would only do what was medically necessary (not out to take our money). If you've been to a previous doctor at a different clinic, make sure you bring your medical records with you.  Don't be afraid to ask questions.Make sure you use your time with him wisely, have your questions prepared.Do your research on treatment types first then bring your ideas and questions to him - he's brilliant and it's good to have some background first. We read articles on ""it's conceivable now"" website and talked with another lesbIn couple first (who wished they had chosen Cornell Weill instead of Columbia, by the way)!Try other doctors at Cornell.  Avoid Dr. Kang.I would say come prepared with questions written down. He is more than happy to go through everything with you, but it helps to be prepared. Be prepared: He's blunt, and he looks young, but wow does he know his stuff. He was able to offer new options that were just being published about, and explain exactly why those options would work in my case.Set aside time to do some research on where to obtain the drugs - first have the Cornell nurse call them in to see if your health insurance will cover them, and if not, research a pharmacy with the best retail price.  The Cornell team does not help that much with this part, so you'll need to spend some time on it.

Also, do attend the ""training"" on how to inject yourself.  It was worth it to feel more comfortable with starting the injections.Ask questions so that you understand each procedure Expect to interact with multiple doctors in addition to Dr. KangHe's a good RE for you if you appreciate the facts.  He can be very empathetic, and is always pleasant, but he's not going to be a touchy-feely hand-holder.  For my money, that's good, because you know he's giving you the lay of the land and not b.s.'ing you.Ask about all your options and try to fully understand them. As clearly as you can, explain your objective to him and try to give suggestions of what you'd like to do. He will try to accommodate you as long as he agrees that it could work. I wanted to be very proactive and move quickly and had suggestions of how I thought we could do that -- he listened to me and then formulated a plan of how we could accomplish what i wanted. Do not expect warm and fuzzy but know that he knows what he is doing and has a big heart.Be prepared to spend a lot of money but in my opinion, it is worth the investmentRealize this is a first for many of us - the struggle, the delight, the disappointment - and to be better about communicating with patients - giving them the general context, the options and the details.

I will say whenever i have expressed concern - or reached out - Dr. Elias has always called me back and given me the dedicated time. Be aware that you might not have your transfer with him. iIt might be another doctor and in my case that other doctor pushed for us to transfer two embryos even though we only wanted to transfer one.Listen to her, and remember that you're not looking for a BFF or therapist, you're looking for someone who will be your true partner in achieving your goal of getting pregnant.Don't think twice. Go! You're one goal is to have a baby, they'll/he'll be your best odds. Just know you're going to a baby making factory, that's how you'll feel because that's what it is, and right now, that's what you need.You have to have patience. It is not likely going to work on the first time. Tell yourself it is a journey. IVF is an art, the doctors learn more about you with each round, and make adjustments as necessary. Stick with it and hopefully it will work. Dr. Spandorfer always talked about what we would fix the next time.Trust in the protocol that she develops for you and try your best to relax and stay confident. Save your stress for when dealing with your inevitable insurance issues (no fault of Dr. Kang or her practice). And when it comes time for the weekly/daily blood tests in the city, get to the hospital as early as you can since it gets crowded quickly since everyone is trying to squeeze it in before work.Don't do it. Wait however long it takes to get an appointment with another doctor. One or two months longer will not hurt you in the end. Dr. Elias is one doctor of a group of doctors at Weill-Cornell at NY Presbyterian Medical Center. He was my main doctor and responsible for my care. However, because he is just one doctor out of a group of amazing doctors, I did see other doctors as well. Dr. Elias did not do my transfer or my retrieval. If seeing the same doctor regularly and for the majority of the procedures is important to a patient, perhaps a smaller practice would be more appropriate. Speak up if you are uncomfortable or unhappy with how things are going - she will respond but if you don't say anything she will move through the steps in a fairly straightforward and methodical manner. If you express your distress/anxiety/disappointment clearly when things don't happen right away she will make adjustments. In general, it's the hardest advice to take to heart, but patience is truly key from one month to the next - be proactive but understand it can take many months. I traveled from DC to see him.  Don't rule him out just because you live outside of New York, if you have hit a wall with physicians in your city and your personal/work life allows for travel.  He's the best and is worth the trip.Be patient and trust his advice.  Be as relaxed and nonchalant about it as you can possibly be, and keep trying.  That's when it happens.Listen closely. Don't be afraid to ask questions. He will answer e-mail but keep yours short; his will be too. 

There's no one like him for aging ovaries. I owe my two children to him.Come prepared to ask questions. He can be very brief with the information but if you ask, he will take his time with you. Be patient. This is a long journey and may have positive and negative outcomes. Don’t be shy. Ask all the questions you have. See above re patient advocacy!Trust him and follow his lead!!Trust his advice. He knows what he's doing and don't be afraid to ask questions.Educate yourself on what grants are available and what your insurance covers in great detail. You are in extremely good hands.  There will be a rollercoaster of emotional highs and lows but Dr. Pfeifer will do everything possible to support you and try to get you to a successful outcome.Choose another doctor at a different institution. Ask questions because you are in the unknown and he will answer and guide you Dont hesitate to call - he is available and responsive. Definitely do the research of other protocols and suggest to him.  Do NOT stay in the same box as every one else.He looks young but he is a great doctor I have recommended him to other friends.Just make the appointment- I was afraid to find out the results but wish i had started this years ago. To ask many questions, even plan and write them down in advance if possible. It might also be helpful to go to appointments with a partner or friend who can ask questions and advocate on your behalf because he is not very forthcoming with information.Don't be afraid to call with questions or concerns throughout treatment. He will always call you back and will be warm and understanding. If everything is going according to plan, he won't reach out to you, so you have to make it a point to call proactively. Be ready to hear the whole truth--good or bad.Be proactive.  Ask him questions and call.  He always responds in a timely manner.  Be your own advocate no matter who your doctor is.Do not expect a hand holder but know you can put the utmost confidence in him.Is you are a very clear cut case, he will be a great doctor for you. If you consider yourself more of a challenge especially in the unknown category, then I would recommend venturing elsewhere. Just know he speaks fast, be prepared to keep up. Also, have all your questions written down before you meet with him. That way you dont miss anything. He will get to all your questions.The clinic is definitely set up to process many patients through procedures like IVF and egg donation. This was fine for me, since that is what I was seeking, but if you are in an exploratory phase or seeking more of a diagnostic opinion, I am not sure if this would be the place for that. However - I was not seeking that, so I don't know for sure. Be sure to ask questions and set expectations of how you'd like to receive information -- which is my guidance for the process generally for any doctor while going through this process. just be prepared to find a good OB as early as 8 weeks as unfortunately, she does not do deliveries!!Ask as many questions as you need. She tends to go very fast, but will respond well if you ask her to slow down and explain things. See him! He is often running late for consults. This is because he takes the appropriate amount of time with each patient (despite their scheduling protocol).  It's worth it. Block out the time in your day. Understand that she is part of a very big system and you have to play by their rules. It's not a personalized and intimate experience.Question whether you have to do Clomid or any protocol. Find out if he thinks it's the best way to go or if it's just the way insurance wants itUnless you are a prime candidate to be successful he will probably suggest donor egg.  If you are not ready for that seek out a second opinion.Ask questions - she will tell you as much as you are interested in but otherwise will tell you next steps and does not always mentally prepare you for how long the process may be Dr. Reichman can be candid but is defintely caring.trust his judgement!No Complaints. I truly enjoyed working with him.Have a positive outlook and understand that is is a proccess.She is a young doctor and will surprise you with her takes on the best way forward, in a very good way.Trust his advice. I would tell them to be prepared to hear the truth because Dr. Melnick is honest and straight forward.His new patient appointments are booked out, but he is worth the wait. Once you are a patient you can even see him ever the same day you call.Trust her! Be very clear with your intentions and hopes. When things get tough, know that Dr. Kang is very good at adjusting the protocol to get the desired results. Strong reputation of success, very good doctor however be aware of his communication style and difficult to reach him.Ask a lot of questions, come prepared.  She is busy, but will engage!Make sure that all questions are prepared during the ultrasounds since those meetings are quick.Don't hesitate!Be patient because nothing happens overnight. Listen to his advice and if needed get a second opinion. He is a great doctor but unfortunately it wasn’t successsful with me.I have met other doctors at Weill Cornell who have a better bedside manner and who give me more information about what’s going on with my body and what to expect next. Go with it - he knows his stuff.Go in informed and with your questions ready go fire off. Your visits with him are very quick and to the point.  He runs a back to back kind of day. He also only performs surgeries on Tuesday but he’ll awlays fit you in. He’s a superhero. Trust his recommendation but look into other ways to boost your egg count if needed.Ask lots of questions and try to get him to anticipate your treatment needs so you don't end up with an issue with the insurance company that can impact your treatment.  Also, he can influence costs so try to include him with treatment decisions that will impact your budget.He talks fast and sometimes you could miss the point. Ask questions and he will take the time to answer themAsk questions, but expect long descriptive answers and his honest opinion. He sometimes can explain the procedure better It may be costly but it's so worth it. You will get answers.Don’t be afraid to ask him anything.If you don't need much hand-holding and want someone to just get straight to the point, without explanation, Dr. Spandorfer is great.Do not go to him if you can't handle not seeing him and getting very little information.Come prepared with questions and don’t be afraid to ask them. He always made time to answer my questions thoroughly. 
Trust the process, he knows what he is doing, if he suggests waiting or doing a test, trust him.Sometimes if the clinic is really busy you may not get to spend a lot of time with her.Bring all of your questions. Dont be afraid to say, ""can you repeat that:"" or ""what does that mean?""If you have to go through Cornell, Dr Chung is one of the better choices but don't expect to see him often Have faith in the medical team.Tell him everything, don't be shy to ask small/""silly"" questions. Just be aware that you don't always see her for every single visit and may not always have her for procedures.You can trust him to do the best for you.  Cornell is a well run clinic and he is a top notch Doctor.He may be blunt at times and you may feel hurried but he has your best interests at heart.Be prepared for the industrial experience!You won’t see so much of him, because most of your treatment is blood tests and scans and the IUI, which is not even done by him. But he manages everything.Listen to him, ask a lot of questions.It feels like a bit of a cattle call and wait times cane be long but it was worth it. He gave me hope and was so supportive.Know that Weill Cornell IVF is a bit of a factory and you will mostly be seeing nurses, but that he is overseeing everything. Ask as many questions in advance as you can. Trust him. Ask him questions! He will answer them.If you're doing donor eggs, I would look elsewhere.I seem to remember that he was a bit soft spoken and reserved, so you must be very direct and listen closely to what he says. I'd give that advice to anyone for any encounter with a doctor. Be patient if ivf doesn’t work the first time. Try again. Know that at Cornell you are mostly talking to the nurses and your dr is in charge of your treatment but not necessarily the retrievals/transfers which can be stressful Trust him... he knows what he is doing, just be patient and relax. His assistant doesn’t return phone calls always so you must stay on top of her. I feel like he is abit old fashion and experienced dr, very straight forward Dr.  Trust her.If you feel like you need extra care, information, or to slow him down - make sure you say so. He will oblige.Don’t go. Davis and Schattman are great there is no need to see this impatient doctor if you’re set on Cornell. Take your time, trust his judgment and timingBe prepared with a list of questions to ask him.  He is generally busy - so if you are prepared, you will make the best use of the appointments.be a squeaky wheel.  Be your own advocate. Cornell is a large clinic. Be prepared with questions to ask. Be proactive.  Don't wait for him to call youCornell is a mad house, be ready to wait and be a number.Trust him.. you are in good hands.Ask lots of questions. He's so busy that you have to make sure you take the initiative to have all of the information you need.Listen to what he tells you. Even if it might cost more money to do what is needed in the end it will be worth it. Be your own advocate and if you feel like you need additional support or testing, ask for it.  She is very receptive to questions and requests.There is nothing negative to give advice about.  I would just say you are making the right choice to go with him!You are an amazing hands.  Dr. Davis is a unique doctor with unsurpassed knowledge of fertility as well as amazing  bedside manner I would recommend to trust him as he knows what he’s doing Don’t give upListen to him. Tell him what you want.He will always give you his honest opinionGet there early and be honest with him about your expectations Don't expect compassion, he will not hold your handGo to him only if you literally do not care about bedside manner and you don't mind being treated like a number.Initially he wasn't super warm.  Don't dismiss him because of that if he isn't super warm at first.  He is wonderful.Know his time is limited as he has many patients so you will see him only briefly.So long as the office is convenient to your work/home and you have time to wait for your appointment, I'd definitely recommend seeing her. He's difficult to understand so listen carefully!Have a list of questions - he covers everything, but he also talks very fast! Ask questions and be prepared to write things down because he is a fast talker.Be honest with her about your situation.    Make sure you spend time talking together, not just at herGreat doctor. Nothing bad to sayDo your research on the process BEFORE going to see her so that you can spend time asking deeper questions. I was a little bit green and regret wasting time asking about basics that I should have researched before. She has a lot of knowledge so go prepared to dig into it.Call and book your appointment today. He is the best!Keep an open mind to whatever Dr. Pereira might suggest. You're in great hands - work together to find a solution that works for you.Don't be afraid to ask questions. Dr. Melnick treats all your questions with respect and kindness so ask anything you need to in order to have the assurances and answers you need.It doesn't matter who you see at Cornell, the place is busy and you won't have a ton of time with the physicians. If you want to spend an hour talking about your health concerns, your diet, supplements, etc, I advise you to find an acupuncturist. Cornell is a large clinic and I find all doctor a bit aggressive in terms of number of embryos transferred. I think they are quite aggressive and that impacts their success rates positively. But risk of multiples is very real and that may not be a great idea for many women. Given my own experience, I would hope Cornell would advocate for lower number of embryos to be transferred.Please be patient, hormones make you emotional.  Just pray or do meditation to get relaxed.  Have faith & trust in your doctor.  He’ll make it happen.  START!  There  is no time like the present , every  woman should get their AMH Bloodwork done.  Also bring your questions, Dr Reichman has an amazing breadth of knowledge, take advantage of that. Go into your appointment knowing that you’re going to be under the best care. Do write down your questions prior to meeting any doctor.When you first go, get a card for registration because I was not aware of it and every time I went early I had to wait until the secretary arrived instead of other people who register on the computer with the card. Everything else is great. If you’re looking for results, a compassionate doctor, and clear communication about every option available- Dr. Elias’ office is the right place to be.He talks fast but don’t be afraid to ask for clarification. Speak up and make sure to ask any questions you have.Please calm down and listen to his advice carefully.Not sure Trust her advice 100%See her! Let her do her work and discuss options, be your own advocate, do your research and have some trust in the process. Don't hesitate to ask her anything.Trust him. Ask clear questions.  Tell him your thoughts/desires. She can sometimes feel rushed but will slow down if you have questions. Ask many questions Ask questions even if you feel rushed.That go in with a open mind and he’s the best doctor I ever had for infertility If it doesn’t work after a couple of tries and you don’t see active involvement in diagnosing what could be the issue, switch centers. Stick with him! Infertility treatment can take a long time, and there will likely be bumps in the road, but Dr. Pereira knows what he is doing and he will get you there. Trust him completely, he knows his job very well and you will be in excellent hands during this journey.Honesty is the name of Dr. Reichman's game. He does not sugar coat or provide false hope. Be prepared for candor, and know that it is in the name of earning your trust. He deeply cares and he is committed to helping you achieve your dream of becoming a parent. Don't be afraid to ask questions.Make sure you're able to make the time commitment to go to the fertility appointments! They're usually twice a week. Block that time out of your work calendar if you can. You might have a few weekends where you'll have to go to UES at 7am on a Saturday morning for a trigger shot in the bum, and go back 24 hours later for the IUI. You might have to make these early morning commitments on a few weekends and quite a bit on weekdays. Prepare your partner to be involved in it too. Clomid can make you look/feel bloated and causes a bit of cramping. It's not horrible, it's just a bit of a sacrifice. Dr Pereira is the best, you won't regret it! :)Follow Dr. Reichman’s advice even if you don’t like it (I was irritated when I had to stop exercising), and fully trust him - he will figure it out!You are great hands.  Follow his advice and expert medical guidance.  He is an awesome Doctor who will treat you with the care and respect you deserve.I would give any patient, of any doctor, the same advice, be patient and ask a lot of questions.To chose him as your reproductive doctor!The clinic does not specialize in immunology, so you may need to seek supplementary adviceTrust him.  If he says there is a chance for a successful pregnancy then follow his lead.  I was at the point where I had no hope.   I went to the consultation because my husband really wanted to go.  After a few miscarriages, I didn't think anything would work.  Dr. Reichman didn't sell me a dream or make promises in any way.  He told us our options and made us think about it.  We chose to move forward and from day one Dr. Reichman guided me through each step.  Everything he said or expected to happen, happened.  I'm not saying that every patient will have a success story, but he knows what he is doing.  I can't imagine him leading a patient on.  He is upfront but gentle when discussing your medical condition.  It took me a little while to have confidence in him, but once he gained my confidence I knew I was in the right hands. Clearly communicate any and all concerns/questions you may have, even if they may seem minor or even if Dr. Reichman does not bring them up.Don't be afraid to ask any and all questions as they are always well received and promptly, clearly answered. He's great with communicating online and always able to be reached and cost conscious for those paying out of pocket. My insurance would not cover a certain procedure that was deemed normal but he decided it wasn't necessary in my case at the $1500 cost. Just don't hesitate.  Trust he will try everything.You will be in the best hands. Just try to get an appointment!I would recommend they be open and honest and be sure to ask questions.  He’s a world of knowledge.Book him ASAPTry to relax during treatments. Acupunture once a week I believed helped me. Don't have too many expectations for the first round of IVF and trust your doctor. Listen to him. He will give it to you straight. Do not hesitate! You will receive excellent care.You can really leave it all up to him to guide you!On first visit give him all information you have so far - any tests or stats on what you have done so far to conceive.  He takes the time to review all of it and will be able to give you great feedback and direction from the first visit.Don't worry, you're in great hands! The sooner you start seeing him the betterVisit the Doctor at an early stage of the process would be better, so you can understand the treatments that exist and could help to your specific problem and also will help you to take fast and smart decisions.   Just go ahead you’re in good and talented hands.You're in the best hands. You have found the best doctor in New York for fertility issues. Be prepared to have to go in for early visits, but they are usually very short.Be patient with the process, he is a wonderful doctor and it is all worth the wait! You will breathe a sigh of relief when you meet Dr. Elias. He will do everything he can to help you.Communicate about your needs and ask any questions; he will be receptive! ",8.800000000000027,8.40000000000005,"Go to a more experienced Doctor Trust what he says. And my one piece of advice for any patient with any doctor is to become informed about the process. He seems willing to discuss and give info about any questions I have- I just need to be prepared with them :) Know what you want out of the experience, ask lots of questions because Dr. P will take the time to answer them. Be open about your fears, concerns, questions, etc...Understand that it is a big clinic and that you won’t see Dr. Goldschlag unless you personally ask for him. It seems like each of the doctors at Weill Cornell have their own support staff so the calibre of that team makes a big difference in your overall experience. Write your questions down and ask them as she is doing the monitoring exams. But do expect honesty and results consistent with the expectations he set. Don't rule him out just because you live outside of New York, if you have hit a wall with physicians in your city and your personal/work life allows for travel. Educate yourself on what grants are available and what your insurance covers in great detail. Ask questions - she will tell you as much as you are interested in but otherwise will tell you next steps and does not always mentally prepare you for how long the process may be Dr. Reichman can be candid but is defintely caring.trust his judgement!No Complaints. He sometimes can explain the procedure better It may be costly but it's so worth it."
30,Weill Cornell Medical College,nurse,"[The] nurses [at Cornell Weill Fertility] are kind and knowledgeable and they walked me through every step of a very overwhelming process and were there for my via phone and email all the time - I am very thankful for their partnership.My primary nurse at Cornell was Christine, who was phenomenal!  She was compassionate and caring throughout my treatment.  She was extremely helpful and would respond quickly to all our questions and concerns regarding medications, dosages, and anything else that came up!  She was extremely reliable and kind and helped make Dr. Reichman's team top-notch!  I had a couple different primary nurses during my IVF treatments -- I thought the nursing staff at large was excellent, very communicative and caring. Nurse Christine at the Tribeca office was amazing!The nursing staff was very responsive--I always got return calls within a couple of hours, and Crystal was the responding nurse 90% of the time. Hannah was very knowledgeable, communicative, and compassionate.  She always delivered directions and test results in a timely manner and with compassion.  She was also very good at returning phone calls in a timely manner.Phone calls were always returned quickly when I had questions.Dr reichman’s nurse Hannah is excellent. Friendly, kind and very easy to get results from and actually reach on the phone with questions. Super responsive. They are incredibly busy but usually return calls within the same business day.  All conversations were very rushed so it was important to have a sense of my questions before we spoke.The nurses are great. very responsive - returned phone calls within about a half-hourShe was very accessible. She came to my apartment for the trigger shot as my husband was nervous too do it.Hannah and the nursing staff was amazing. They would respond to my questions very quickly. They are all very professional, caring and friendly. The front desk was always very welcoming and organized.Everyone was extremely efficient and helpful. I preferred the tribeca office because it was much quieter/faster.Nurses are very efficient and lovely to deal with. The only issue I feel is that nurses should have email also to communicate with patients or to update results on email and update daily protocol. My primary nurse Christine as well as the whole staff at Weill Cornell in Tribeca are amazing. They are kind, professional and are always there to help and answer questions. This is not an easy process to go through and they really do make it better and easier. I can't say enough good things about themLisa and Jan were always prompt in returning calls and answering questions.  They were also positive in their communications. Sarah M. Fricke checked in with me almost every day during my egg donor selection, retrieval and transfer. She explained my medication procedures in detail (1 1/2 hours in person) and was smart, organized and a great communicator. She responded to every email and question very quickly and efficiently. My nurse responded to the inquiries I had within the same day. She was excellent! Hannah was incredible. She was kind, compassionate, and concise. She always provided clear instructions and promptly returned any messages I left with questions. While I theoretically had a primary nurse, I spoke to someone different every other day. There was very little continuity in terms of my nurses, which was frustrating. If I left a message for a specific nurse, someone else would call me back. i felt like I had to stay on top of every detail b/c none of the nursing staff was consistent who I was dealing with. I did not have one nurse exclusively during my time there so I cannot give detailed feedback, but the nurses I did communicate with were for the most part organized, supportive and helpful, despite being undoubtedly very busy. Nurses doing phlebotomy ere quick, wait was never that long.Elizabeth would call each day during monitoring and provide all pertinent information in a clear and concise way.  She was able to answer many questions for me and if she couldn't answer a question she would put me in contact with Dr. Davis immediately.She was kind, committed, thoughtful, easy-going, and empatheticDevon calls every day on the dot at 3:30 - she is very sweet/compassionate and knows what she is talking about.It was what you would expect from a top-notch facility. They called back quickly, delivered news with compassion, whether good or bad. They kept everything organized and got you answers when you needed them.Nothing stood out negatively or positively. They performed their job and we had no qualms. They were helpful when called upon and we never felt like we were being brushed off.Because Weill-Cornell is such a huge hospital with a big fertility center, I didn't spend too much time actually speaking to Siobhan. However, whenever I did have a question about something or when the team needed to be in contact with me, it was always seamless. I never had any issue. Nurse was very knowledgeable and accessible. Diana from records was extremely diligent and helpful in navigating the paperwork etc. Elizabeth was very responsive and experienced.The nursing staff at Cornell are what make it a great clinic. My experience with each of the nurses/PAs was exceptional. These are the people who call you to give you results (sometimes daily) and who you call in a panic, so I think in some ways they become more important than your doctor. My nurse was very sweet. I absolutely adore her. She’s patient, she’s honest and she’s compassionate. I like that she takes her time during our conversations. She is very smart and try’s her best to help me understand what is going on in my treatment.Jennifer and all the nursing staff are absolutely wonderful. So compassionate, caring, attentive, and organized. They were patient and very clear, I received calls from my nurse after every visit explaining exactly what  have to do next. She was always very nice and personal.Kind, patient, and responded to all questions. Gave clear directions.The nurses always seemed very busy and rushed.  They did not have a ton of insight beyond letting me know what my daily medication would be.My husband would call her with a ton of questions and although she must have been busy she always stayed on the phone to talk to him. Never rushed him off and was so kind!!It wasn't as easy to develop a relationship with the nursing staff since I never saw them in person.  They are very knowledgeable.Dr. Pereira's staff always went above and beyond. The office staff is more than helpful with assisting in all paperwork. The nurses made sure every girl felt at ease. Having your blood taken daily can be trying & they made what should be difficult seem easy. They genuinely care when asking how you're feeling.  So warm & compassionate. We call Dr. Perira and his staff our ""Dream Team"" Dr. Pereira is also supported by a fantastic team of smart, compassionate and personable staff – they truly take the time to get to know you, address you by name and are always smiling which after months of early morning appointments really helps to keep your spirits high.  Moreover, a daily phone call from a friendly and familiar team member or Dr. Pereira himself (on occasion) to discuss bloodwork results allows for personalized care.They were great & knew how to deal with all types of patients.  They took it all in & responded with compassion & patience.  Crystal took the utmost care when calling me with test results. She was wonderful. Everyone in his office are so kind and compassionate. They always are very clear and prompt on reaching out to you ASAP. They always answer any questions/concerns and when they can’t they will get an answer for me and reach back. Nurses there are great The entire nursing staff was professional and lovely as can be, which is exactly what you want when you are going through something as serious and intimidating as fertility treatment.Everyone at the clinic was very nice and always helpful. Setting up appointments was easy and I always got a follow up call with results in the afternoon. If they couldn’t reach me they’d call again instead of just leaving a message.
I always felt like everyone knew who I am when I called and they directed my concerns to dr Pereira as necessary. This was the first clinic (out of 3) where I did not feel like a numberThe care co-ordinator was extremely helpful. After each test, I was always promptly called afterwards with the results. The nurse (Crystal) was good. Exceptional, organized, reliable, communicative, helpful, the best.Christine was fantastic. She always called with my results, returned emails and phone calls very promptly, and answered all of my many questions without making me feel crazy (I was an anxious patient!) She went out of her way to make sure we always had what we needed in terms of meds, and seemed genuinly happy for us whenever we got good news. I loved her upbeat and positive personality.The nursing staff and front desk staff are all terrific. I am so impressed with them, and grateful for the care they provided. 
Our main nurse Christine is a so kind, reassuring, and extremely organized. She always answered my emailed questions quickly and set my mind at ease. I was always so happy to see her at the practice. 
With all the required consent forms and appointments, IVF entails quite a bit of admin which can be burdensome during an already stressful process. The Cornell team is a well-oiled machine, and kept me on track with my medications, visits, etc. Sounds like a small thing but it's extremely helpful. Our previous clinic was disorganized and it was SO frustrating and wasted so much time and energy. 
The Tribeca front desk staff is also extremely kind and knew me by name. They all seem genuinely delighted when my FET was a success, which made that happy appointment feel even more special. 
Thank you Team Tribeca! My primary nurse at Weill Cornell is very knowledgeable about fertility treatments. Although I had difficulty communicating with them. I feel that since they have many patients, sometimes they could loose their ""patience"". They would always return your phone call but you most times have to leave a message in an answering machine and waiting for their phone call. I also feel that sometimes, they are rushed when you are in the phone with them or in person. This infertility journey is as stressful as it could be and we need someone from our team to be there for us to help us get through his journey. I remember one time during in this clinic during monitoring, the doctor (not my primary doctor) told me to give ganirelix since some of my eggs are growing faster than the rest. I thought she would repeat the instructions before leaving. I didn't ask again, I thought I could just ask a nurse. I went and asked for a nurse but the nurse (not my primary nurse) told me, if the doctor told you to do it, do it; ""nothing yet is written in your file so I don't know what the doctor said"". I left and cried but went back to the doctor that did the monitoring. This could have been avoided if the nurse just had asked the doctor what was said! As a nurse myself, I try to bridge that gap between the patient & the doctor. If something was not clear to the patient, I will make sure and even take ""strides"" to ask the doctor about the plan of care. I also feel that they could have an email sent to patients for ""instructions"" during monitoring as to avoid confusions. My primary nurse that I communicated with was Hannah. She always showed compassion during every interaction or phone call. She answered every question and made  sure you understood your directions and next steps before hanging up the phone. Even when meeting in person about something Hannah never rushed you and was very thorough in her care and explanations. She also replied very timely to emails.Dr. Riechman's main nurse is fantastic. She always answers my questions and when I wanted to order fewer meds since i had to pay OOP as I hit my insurance limit, she worked with me on ordering just what was necessary. She's a pleasure every time I speak with her. Any other nurses that cover for her are also great.Katia, Dr. Rosenwaks’ nurse practitioner is without question, an exceptional human. She is truly Dr. Rosenwaks right hand person, and on top of all of his cases. She is compassionate, professional, and caring all at once. She answers every hard question, calls back when she gets the answers from Dr. Rosenwaks that she needs, and is incredible at explaining anything clearly and concusses with patience and understanding of what you are going through, even if she hasn’t experienced it firsthand. 

Wally (Waleska) is Dr. Rosenwaks’ office administrator, and is wonderful in every way. She has been with him for a few decades and is the friendly voice you need when you need to make appointments for leave word for Dr. Rosenwaks.

Last, I could not be more grateful to Jenny. She is the nurse/ ultrasound technician always on hand for appointments with Dr. Rosenwaks and her positivity and support is everything. Christine was professional excellent and compassionate. If I had a question she had an answer. If I had concerns she was able to put me at ease. She was also very organized and detailed oriented. She is truly the best. Christine was my primary IVF nurse and I cannot write enough good things about her here. She is absolutely incredible, extremely organized, thorough, timely and so friendly! I honestly have no idea how she stays on top of so many patients and cycles and remembers every detail - I feel like she should be the COO of a fortune 500 company.  Everyone on the nursing staff is amazing as well, they are so friendly and helpful - you can really tell everyone loves what they do and where they work. The nurse I was assigned was easy to communicate with (via phone or email). The nursing staff was amazing. Test results were given promptly on the same day and they responded to all questions within 30 min of leaving a message. Dr Kang’s assistant Diana is the most organized and professional person I have ever dealt with. She ensured every prescription was on time. She dealt with insurance no problem, scheduled appointments, and returned frantic phone calls within minutes, even when the office was closed. This office is busy yes - but its run like a machine. Every question got answered and I always felt that it was moving with speed and efficiency. As a new yorker I appreciate that. We traveled into our appointments from 3 hours away and the fact that it was so predictable was key to making that work. She was always available and on top of things. She has a calm and reassuring personality.I have just as high of praise for his nurse Christine as I do for Dr. Reichman. She is beyond kind, smart and communicative. I always had a lot of questions and never once did she make me feel like a bother. Instead, she always put me at ease with her quick and helpful answers. They are quite the impressive team.Christine as well as the other nurses were incredibly helpful throughout the process. From one on one instruction around taking the medications to the small group class, they helped us feel comfortable upfront. Throughout the process it was also great to be able to call them and even email them anytime. They were very helpful with making sure to order just the right amount of medication as my insurance was limited. They always called me every afternoon with clear instructions.Val was wonderful! Overall the nursing staff was great. I also met with Julie ( i think) on Day 1. Evangeline was the nurse who called me regularly.  Val was beyond helpful  and supportive, but everyone was great. I always encountered a positive experience with the nursing staff during my monitoring visits as well as pre/post-retrieval monitoring.The main nurse that we interacted with was knowledgeable, patient and organized. She always followed up with results, protocol adjustments or other directions and was clear in her communication. In general, the nursing staff that I interacted with for blood tests and ultrasounds were all friendly and put me at ease.Katia is absolutely wonderful - she is very organized, compassionate, and communicates clearly. She replies to messages in a timely manner. When she is not in the office, the other nurses who have filled in for her have not been as on top of things and during these instances I have received misinformation. Christine was outstanding and I absolutely loved working with her. She is smart, compassionate and extremely organized! I always looked forward to hearing from her with instructions or results and she was always so quick to respond to my calls and emails. She worked with my insurance company directly to make sure I had everything I needed and the process was completely seamless. She celebrated with us when we had good news and was empathetic and encouraging in more difficult times. She always made me feel like I had a friend in my corner throughout this process and while I am ecstatic to have had success and be moving forward, I will miss her! The nursing team in general is incredible - everyone is so kind and caring. I seriously considered a second career as a nurse after interacting with this team. The second nurse, Katia, as well as her other colleagues were extremely compassionate and kind. Devon (who I believe does not work there anymore) was quite cold, it appeared, and lacked the compassion shown by others. I spent a lot of time at WCM. I stopped counting after my 60th appointment. Yet somehow sometimes I would oddly look forward to those early morning appointments, which often required me to get probed and poked for blood work, etc. It was definitely because the staff was SO lovely and friendly, especially the nurse Christine who was clear and concise and had super positive energy, which I loved. Lisa and Jane are Dr. Elias's two IVF NYC Nurses that call to give daily updates.  They also called me for IUI next steps as well.  They were great to work with and when I called multiple times for follow up questions, they always called me back the same day.Worked with Hannah during the IUIs, she was fantastic. She then went on maternity leave and we worked with a new nurse, who was less familiar in the lead role. Had a few hiccups along the way, but got better as went went. Holly, Lindsay, Connie and Jersey are the best.  The treat you like family and not just a number.  They care about your success and are always positive even when you are going through the worstLisa and Jane were great and communicated with a lot of positivity and high energy.  They were consistent and very considerate with regard to advice for my medication as I was paying out of pocket (advising on the more cost effective pharmacies).  I received very quick responses to all my emails.  I also loved going to the Mt. Kisco office which was much more intimate and the team there is fantastic.  It felt like a family practice. The nurses (Cheryl Sabatino, Sarah Fricke, Juliana Shen, etc.) were all very capable, knowledgeable and efficient.  They got back to me within a reasonable amount of time and responded to my questions in detail.  The nurses who drew blood, in the mornings, were also very professional and caring.  These nurses (who were part of the monitoring staff in the mornings) are some of the only nurses I've met who consistently were able to draw blood on the first try, instead of poking me repeatedly to find a good vein.  I only ever spoke to Hannah and Christine. Both were good and responsive. However they will never really answer questions for you and will tell you to email Dr Reichman. She is extremely responsive.  ALways answers my questions in a timely matter.  She is organized.   Hannah was who I mostly spoke to during my treatment. The office ALWAYS called with results and instructions on time, and she is just genuinely a warm person. I didn't have all that many needs for frequent communication but I have nothing but positive things to say about my experience.The nursing staff was always available to answer questions, speak through concerns, and show kindness through the whole process.  They returned calls in a very timely fashion and explained anything I didn't understand. They were professional and skilled in performing any tests required.Holly the nurse who helps with prescriptions and such is super helpful - responds well to emails and is very informative. The other staff - Connie (manager?), Lindsay (nurse who assists Dr. Melnick and takes bloods), and Jersey (front desk) are all very nice and work really well as a team.At first I was communicating with Lisa Artusa, she was really sweet, caring and always there when I had questions. It's been two years or so now that a new nurse came (Jane Mary Taraf) and she is also amazing. Always there, responsive, so sweet. I have some trouble for my bloodworks because I have some really little veins. I almost faint everytime and she's here to take care of me, she stays until everything is over and she has so much compassion. Thanks God she's here! I feel like I can tell her everything. The entire staff was incredibly professional. I received such a high level of knowledge and compassion at every step. They were also so responsive--we never had to wait for answers or request information more than one time.Crystal is absolutely wonderful. She is compassionate, kind and has so much knowledge about the IVF process. She is extremely organized and makes you feel like she is in it with you. In addition to Crystal, all of the staff at Cornell are wonderful. The monitoring staff show compassion and really make your daily monitoring experience more pleasant. That said, the weekend communication is a little less organized and it would be nice to have a way to contact the office more easily to ask questions.Although I never met Crystal in person -- she's the one that delivered my blood results over the phone every day and gave me instructions -- I feel like we developed a bond over the eight months of treatment. She was super compassionate and clear in her communications so that I don't have to call back, and if I needed to call back, she was super helpful. I spoke with Christine often and she was excellent she answered all my questions, gave clear instructions during the cycle, and provided reassurance when I needed it. Hannah was very responsive and also very compassionate.  Also, she was very clear with instructions on medication.  Everything you could want in a nurse.The nursing staff at CRM is fantastic. Whenever I had a question about medications or procedures I received a call back the same day. The IVF class CRM offers is lead by the nursing team, this made me and my husband feel so much more comfortable about injections. Christine Lu was the absolute, absolute and I repeat absolute best. She was very compassionate, kind and you could tell she genuinely cared about my well-being. I could not have asked for a better nurse than her. I became fully dependent on her kindness and advice.  All of the staff has been super helpful and attentive to my needs, returning all my calls in a timely manner and taking care of everything I needed. I mostly spoke to Evangeline, and then later I think they switched from people having one nurse to patients not being matched with a single nurse. All of the nursing staff was excellent at returning phone calls and very compassionate (ie when they are calling to give bad news)The majority of my interactions at the office and via phone we great. The team remembered me absent my name at each visit .Willing to review care and dosage, answer questions etc. Christine was assigned to me for my third round as I had a bad interaction with someone on a follow up call after my miscarriage. I only interacted with Dr. Melnick's primary nurse over the phone. All of our interactions were perfectly pleasant, but it can take some time to get them on the phone (you usually have to leave a message and get a call back by end of day). Sometimes I got a call back from her AFTER the receptionist had left, so if she told me I needed to make an appointment for the following day, I was unable to.
Lisa, Dr. Elias’s main IVF nurse, is ok. I generally felt pretty rushed when talking on the phone with her and occasionally she gave incorrect information. I really like Jane, one of the other nurses. The nursing staff in general is great at this clinic.My nurse took the time and energy to field my million and one questions. She was wonderful and timely as possible. Additionally, the nurses who handled monitoring hours were all friendly and efficient. Jamie - Only had her the first cycle. She called me the first day and the last to let me know it failed but other than that I always talked with Allison. She gave me the wrong info which had to get changed and was thankfully caught before I gave myself the wrong meds. Was weird hearing from her that my cycle failed when I literally had nothing to do with her. She was no longer with Dr. Goldschlag when I came back six months later for my next cycle. 

Allison - Was there from my first cycle (she caught Jamie's mess up) all the way until my successful pregnancy. She often seemed overwhelmed, probably because of Dr. Goldschlag's caseload and how many phone calls she had to make. She always returned phone calls, and gave clear instructions. She was also a lot more down to earth than some of the other nurses I came across there, which was nice. She also was SOO happy when she got to call me with my positive pregnancy test after our fourth cycle, we were both crying on the phone together, because she had been with me through it from the beginning. 

Cheryl and Tamara - Dr. Goldschlag's nursing team this time is a little more haphazard, but they call me back and they seem to have things together. I dont have a real feel for them yet because I just returned to the clinic in the past month, but so far nothing bad to say. Hannah was always prompt and clear with follow up phone calls. She has been very organized and thorough.  She was able to communicate with my insurance so I had a clear understanding of what part of the treatment is covered, and what I should expect to pay for.  There was no surprise bills.  She has also been helpful in letting me know what is the next step in procedure such as  when to get blood work, when to take meds, etc..  

The only negative I can say, is it can be difficult to speak with them on the phone.  There is some phone tag.  It would be much easier if they can communicate via email.The entire nursing staff at Cornell is amazing - they are caring, take the time to walk you through every detail of your protocol and answer any and all questions you have. My main nurse coordinator, Hannah, was very helpful with treatment and appointments and trying to resolve issues with my insurance coverage. The IVF training nurse was excellent, helpful and compassionate also. And the nurses that drew my bloods each day were skilled, gentle, upbeat and friendly. The nursing staff in NYC upper east side was very busy and I felt like just a number - which was fine. I had most monitoring visits in the satellite office in Mt Kisco and the nurse there wasn’t too friendly not talkative, but she was overall ok - that didn’t bother me. I was very impressed by my nurse Hannah Giamo and all of the nursing staff.  Everyone was very knowledgable, responsive, caring and kind.Nurse and nursing staff were always available for any questions. We got prompt call backs for our daily monitoring results as well as any ad-hoc requests we had. Hannah always had smile on her face when we interacted with her, made us feel warm and welcome. Hannah's approach is very similar to Dr. Reichman in terms of compassion and care.Hannah was my primary nurse, but you will often have a different nurse call you each day.  At first I was weary about speaking with a different nurse each day, but they are very well organized and able to answer all your questions. The nursing staff at Cornell is excellent, particularly at the Tribeca office. You are in great hands.There is one nurse who is not very compassionate and extremely rude on the phone. She talks quickly and becomes irritated if you ask questions for clarification. She acts as if you should know and understand everything she is spitting at you. My first interaction with her was very unpleasant and I hung up crying. I left a message for a call back, because you never get a live person, and she never called me back, which was extremely stressful with the time sensitive nature. I then had to wait another month, which was fine because she stressed me out so much, I felt completely overwhelmed and needed to take some time to process everything. Every interaction with her has been unpleasant and I have felt dismissed. I explained to her that I needed a specific pharmacy for my insurance to cover the medications and she claimed, ""We never had that conversation."" My prescription was called in to the specific pharmacy, after being called into a different one, so obviously we had a conversation about it. She was very curt on the phone, which makes a stressful time even more stressful. She was also very rude with me when I asked if my file mentioned to try and call after 3:00pm, because I'm a teacher. She made it clear that that's not always going to be possible. I said I understood that, I just wanted to know if it was in my file because I had asked the doctor's assistant to make a note of it. She is so quick to talk over you and doesn't hear what you're asking. She has taken an already stressful time in a woman's life and made it much more stressful, which is terrible. Just because she deals with this everyday and it is easy for her, she needs to understand that this is overwhelming and patients have questions. It was a very upsetting experience. 

That being said, Dr. Goldschlag's assistant, Shanise, is lovely and has gone above and beyond to make sure my questions get answered and that I feel comfortable with the process. I mentioned my interaction with the nurse and how upsetting it was to feel invisible and dismissed and she really stepped up and has helped with the process. She told me that I should always contact her directly and she will get my questions to the right place and get back to me with the necessary information. After our conversation I even got a call from the doctor, which I didn't even ask for. It remains stressful that no one answers the phones and you need to leave a message, but Shanise will get back to you within 2 hours. For the most part, the nursing staff was good overall.  It was nice that someone (not the main nurse) would call you back in a timely manner.  There were a few times they did not call back or forgot to after some results but it wasn't during the IVF cycle.  The only issues I really had was trying to have the nurse understand the prescriptions authorization process which was different than just sending it to a pharmacy, etc.Nursing staff was very helpful and always a phone call away. They always called you when you went in for monitoring that day. The nursing team was phenomenal. Holly answered all my questions with patience, compassion and expertise. Strengths: Organized, responsive, good communicators

Weakness: NoneThe front desk/reception staff (who also helped with insurance follow-up) was direct, but overall ok. I quickly learned it was a busy clinic and they did the best they could. There was a Practice Specialist, who was very personable and a good listener when the issue with the assigned nurse arose. The nurse I was assigned to, however, was very curt on the phone and insisted on phone only follow-up, even though email was preferred for my partner and me. After a mandatory IVF orientation class, when my partner asked a question, she laughed at him (there were other couples there too) and as she apologized after seeing our faces she laughed through her apology. I did not want to jeopardize our treatment and did not bring it up with the staff or doctor.  I inquired about being switched to another nurse coordinator but was told that they were short staffed and we'd have to continue working with this particular nurse. From here the issues with follow-up got a bit delayed and unacceptable to the point that we decided to put our IVF on hold due to communication issues between the insurance/billing office and our insurance. I would say that a patient has to do all the legwork between the insurance and the clinic, and it can get quite complicated and unfortunately, the clinic does not offer too much guidance, so you are really on your own. I loved everyone at Weill Cornell Tribeca, from the two front desk office coordinators (hi guys!), to the ladies who drew my blood, too Rosa (Dr. Reichman's scheduler) to Hannah and the rest of his team. I really felt loved and supported and cared for! Plus the office is so nice and clean and efficient. Everyone associated with Dr. Elias and Cornell are amazing.  They all care about their patients and will jump through hoops for you.  Dr. Elias will check in with you over the weekend, you always get a call back from him or anyone ranging from Jessica in the office to JoAnne one of the nurses in Mt Kisco to Jane And Lisa in the city.  All are amazing and sensitive to whatever the situation.
They were all very caring and aware. They knew who I was as soon as I walked in and would always make sure I had all the information I needed including appointments, medicine, etc. Lisa Artusa is amazing. So sweet and lovely. Just makes you feel special and never a burden. Reminder of nurses were always nice. I like the fact that all of them are on the same page. I did not have a preference because I was confidence in all three of them.  They always return my calls and explain the next stepI felt that the nurse was not always available and on many questions rerouted me to drDavis for answers. I understand that she was only part time and when I called was most of the time speaking to answering machine. However she did return the calls eventually but not always promptly.The nursing team was exceptional! They always called back, answered emails and never made you feel like you were one of many. The nurses are super sharp at Weill Cornell wish they had nurses in TriBeCa office. Always responsive even if primary nurse is off. Difficult to get to upper east side office if you live downtown. Very nice and helpful nursing staff answers any and all questions. She was absolutely amazing, I communicated with her several times a day via e-mail. She was always warm and honest. She did the ""hand holding"" which I GREATLY appreciated. I hope to work with her again.My nurse, Cheryl, was great. However, the office staff (billing, Dr. Spandorfers assistant) was a nightmare. My insurance required pre-certification, and since this was my first experience with fertility treatments, I had no idea how to go about doing this. The nursing team barely walked me through the process. I spent hours calling insurance and coordinating with my nursing team. The wrong prescriptions were called in causing a delay in my trigger shot.. it was all very unorganized. Dr. Goldschlag's biggest asset is his practice coordinator Shanise.  She's a true gem.  One of his nurses is particularly compassionate and consistently helpful, the others are robots who are condescending and act like they're doing you a favor by returning your call or sharing updates. Organized, compassionate and very responsive nurses and overall great staff.  All very professional and kind.I had very little interaction with my primary nurse.  I saw her once at the start of each cycle to go over medications.My primary nurse was wonderful - she clearly communicated my protocol and dosages and was extremely caring.

Whenever I interacted with other nurses at the clinic, they were wonderful and kind as well. Lisa has been great to work with, and is very responsive to emails and calls. I saw her once at my initial meeting and then during weekend monitoring, I ran into her in the blood work room. She remembered me and was very sweet. She was also incredibly sweet when she called to tell me I was not pregnant - I imagine a very difficult call to have to make. 

I also interacted a lot with Jessica and Joanne at the Mt. Kisco office and they are both lovely.  The Cornell nursing staff was great. They are quick to return your calls and answer your questions thoroughly. Evangeline was, for the most part, great to work with! I got to know her after our FOT cycle and continued working with her on our second IVF cycle. She was typically responsive to my calls and emails, more so than the first nurse I had been assigned with our TESE and first egg retrieval. She once called someone else and left them a message with my protocol, which was concerning. I addressed it with Dr. Pfeifer and she addressed it with her. During our 2nd IVF cycle, Dr. Pfeifer had made a last minute addition of Lupron to my protocol, and due to insurance and timing, I was going to have to pay out-of-pocket for it from a local pharmacy. Evangeline was able to locate some in storage at the clinic and provided it to me free of charge.

One of the downsides of the nursing team is that they are all located at the Upper East Side location, so if you are seeing Dr. Pfeifer in Tribeca, you might not get to meet/see Evangeline in person. One thing to note - you will always be leaving voice mails for nurses and assistants. BUT, don't get discouraged, I received phone calls back the same day 99% of the time. Your messages will be returned!She is not a nurse but a coordinator for Dr Rosenwaks. She has been helpful with scheduling. The nurses are great you can call them anytime with any questions. Hannah talked to me many times when I had bad news and patiently answered a million questions. They always contacted me in a timely manner and took time to answer all of my questions and explain everything to me.So far my experience with my primary nurse, Evangeline and the nurse staff has been excellent. Yes, you have to be on standby if you are expecting a call from them but I think that is standard. When my nurse does call she takes the time to answer all of my questions.She calls back and answers questions all the time.   Sometimes there is a delay in reply as she is out of the office now and then. When someone is covering for her there is not always the same level of quality in communications and care.  Nurses were mostly available but at times hard to reach. And they forgot to call me to tell me to come for day 3 transfer. Hannah was great. She called at the same time every day with results.  Just like with Dr. Schattman, ask questions- because the phone calls are quick and before you know it you are off the phone and forgot to ask!Dr Davis' primary nurses are amazing. I worked with 1 in 2014 who was fantastic. She left in 2016, and there was a period of time where a nurse was filling in. I experienced communication gaps during this time period. Dr Davis now has a new primary nurse, and she is also excellent. I have had VERY mixed experiences with the nursing team.  The attitude, level of organization and information given vary drastically from nurse to nurse.  I find that most of them are not very compassionate, frankly - I'm ok with that as I understand they have a difficult job but every once in a while it would feel nice to have a personal connection.  I have never been in a situation where I have not timely received instructions or have been given incorrect instructions, however - they are on the whole, organized when it comes to following protocols.  The nursing team is very diligent about communicating results and next steps.Katie is an excellent nurse and always answered my questions within a few hours. She is super thorough and organized - nothing ever fell through the cracks with her. I saw her frequently, but other nurses often did the blood work monitoring or ultrasounds. They were all great. Like Dr. Davis, Katie was always completely up to speed on my treatment, which reassured me that my case was being followed personally.The nurses are all good. They will call back and are much easier to get in touch with than doctors. My first cycle I had Hunter who was great. She then left Cornell and I had several nurses during my second cycle. It did not really bother me - I got the call every day about meds and did not feel like my care was compromised bec I know Zev was closely managing everything. The nurse was nice and called every day as expected. She always had the information I needed and would answer questions. The one major issue is you can almost never get her one the phone if you miss a call or have an adhoc question. You have to have your cell phone glued to your hip all afternoon. The nursing staff and techs were all nice and friendly.Shanice the coordinator is somewhat cold in the beginning but I think it's party due to the sheer volume of patients she has to coordinate. I did not like the fact that I ALWAYS had to leave a voicemail and then was called back. I never got a live person. This was extremely frustrating for me. I would have preferred some form for email ability since these are personal calls and very difficult to take in a small work office setting.   Half way through I was assigned a new nurse and had a terrible first experience with her. I told goldschlag about not and he addressed it with her and we worked through the problem. Jennifer (IUI nurse) was great. She was usually available when I called or at least gave me a call back that same day. Super organised and willing to answer my questions without rushing me off the phone.

Diana, the care coordinator was also super helpful and she worked pretty seamlessly with Jennifer to schedule my IUIs and other appointments.

The IVF team is different and I am just getting started there. The nurse I was assigned, Sarah, is different from Jennifer and a bit less warm and more ""rushy"". While I haven't had many interactions with her yet, so far I am not as satisfied as I was with the IUI nurse. The nurse I met at our consultation called in my prescriptions, spoke to me once, and then I've never heard from her again. I was transferred to another nurse on the team who has been wonderful and a good communicator, but no one ever called to tell me that this transfer of responsibility was happening. I was left in the dark, confused as to whom I should be calling with my questions. I was lucky in that Evangeline was my nurse for both my IUI and IVF cycles, and got to know me throughout the process.  I've never met my nurse Evangeline, but she's the one who calls me with results from the bloodwork and instructions. She's always very clear about next steps, and always has time to answer my questions. Primary Nurse: had a miscalculation issue regarding cycle days and expected time of embryo transfer. Nurse was not very clear in setting expectations and I had to do a last minute stressful scramble with my work schedule.  Spoke to Dr. Davis and requested to have nurse changed.  Subsequent nurse was was very clear and concise thereafter.

Nursing Staff: high volume clinic, very professional and friendly except for one nurse (eastern block - russian/ukranian?) who was a bit cold and never bothered to have me check my name/birthdate blood tube label like all the other nurses did.  

Surgical nursing staff for retreivals at NY Presbyterian: phenomenal.  Can't say enough good things about them.  Super caring and attentive.The nurses work hard here, however the only method of communication that Cornell used when I went here was phone calls. When you called them you always had to leave a voicemail. The nurse would always call you back, but it could be hours later and would be at a random time. This did not work for me as I work full time in client service and can't be available when a nurse decides to call me back. There was no email or online portal. Lisa is a riot!! She made the process so easy. She was organized and a pleasure to work with. My first IVF worked and the 2nd failed. She was so sad when she called to give me the news about the failed IVF. She and Dr. Elias make a great team.There were two or three nurses assigned to Dr. Kang.  They were all kind and responsive, although you always have to leave a message when you call.My primary nurses were responsive and compassionate. 

With regard to the nursing staff, because of the hundreds of patients, occasionally there will be a prescription mishap (forget to call pharmacy or call the wrong pharmacy) or provided with wrong instructions (instructed to come back next day for monitoring and blood work when you were just there that morning and follicles are still small).Elizabeth was available for my many questions. I did not see her that often though but it was not necessary. Mostly needed her for questions on protocol, etc. All of the nurses were warm and welcoming to me.During monitoring appointments it was difficult to ask a nurse specific questions. I would have to wait in a separate room to the side until a nurse was available to answer my questions. Because things can be very time sensitive with treatment, it was still better to wait in person than to wait for a response on the phone.Jackie was absolutely amazing. She called me back instantly, was very informative and always full of hope.

The other nurses at the clinic are nice and attentive as well.I can't remember her name, but she was very organized and straightforward. Very responsive to my phone calls and questions. Always received a phone call back within 2 -3 hours.I had a very bad experience with Dr. Goldschlag's primary nurse. When I had the ectopic pregnancy (my first ever pregnancy), I'd call and ask questions to which she'd respond ""use your own judgement."" This was very difficult as I was brand new to the fertility process. After my ectopic pregnancy I received methotrexate shots. I called and told her I was still cramping and bleeding a lot. I don't think she ever went back and told the doctor and I needed emergency surgery to remove my fallopian tube.For the most part they were to the point and quick. You could tell that had many patients to deal with and didn't have a lot of time to spend with you. They did their job well but lacking some bedside manner. Both our IUI and IVF nurses called us every day with results and Drs instructions. Both were very helpful with handling medication issues with the insurer and pharmacy. Hannah was amazing. She took so much time to explain the medication schedule and protocols. She also sat down with me and helped me make a detailed calendar of what would happen and when (these were obviously approximations but it was so nice to have some idea of the schedule ahead of time). This is a very overwhelming process the first time and she absolutely made it more manageable. My main nurse was not the nurse who treated me as I was in the Tribeca location. However, she was the one I communicated with regarding results and medications. She was very helpful when available, but often I would need to speak with another nurse as schedules seemed to fluctuate.They are fantastic. Total pros and so invested in your care. They are there for you 24/7. Nurses were cordial, personable, thorough, and called me back promptly if there I had any questions. There is always a nurse accessible either through the phone or at the office to address any concerns. They called after every visit to report on progress and instructions. However, I would have like more of an explanation of what to expect in terms of potential side effects from treatments and procedures.Kathleen is always very respectful and approachable. Easy to contact by email and phone. Very understanding of our delicate situation. Evangeline, or sometimes Devon, would call with any instructions or explanations and they were always very clear.  A couple of times it required them calling a pharmacy more than once and they were always right on top of it.  Very helpful.Some weeks I spoke with Hannah every day. She was amazing and would call daily at the same time with my blood or ultrasound results or drug instructions. I felt comfortable with Hannah and felt like she cared about me.Evangeline was so great - from answering any crazy questions I had to helping me call pharmacies all over the city to find a special medicine she wanted me on after my positive pregnancy test. I sincerely enjoyed having her participate in my care.Always answered phone calls and emails within a few hours. Very personable and approachable. Jackie Stahl is amazing.  I cannot say enough about her.  She is knowledgeable, funny, kind, encouraging, efficient but will take the time you need, generous, organized... I really could go on and on.  Jackie was phenomenal, though she is no longer working at CRM the last I was in touch with her.  Honest and encouraging and no beating around the bush.My nurse was not very accessible. I am not from ny so I was doing an out of town cycle and struggle to communicating with her, getting orders and prescriptions.
when I was 6 weeks pregnant I started bleeding and called the emergency line. They never got back to me, just sent me an email asking how bad was the bleeding - at that point I was already on the emergency room (thankfully it was a SCH that have already resolved)Jackie was the best. She told it like it was and answered all the questions for us that Dr. Spandorfer didn't.Dr. Kligman's nurses (whoever was on staff September 2013) were absolutely amazing. These ladies are the ONLY reason I was able to even figure out what was going on. They were compassionate, lovely people who really cared about making sure I was on the right track. I am so grateful for the care I received from them. Working with Evangeline was great! Her care and compassion really stood out. She is compassionate and funny (when applicable). Mainly, she’s thoughtful cares about our communication and my questions.Hannah and the whole nursing team were amazing! So caring and supporting and always available for any questions. Extremely responsive, particularly since my wife and I do not live in NYC. They were always willing to work with our travel schedule to accomodate our needs. I have to chase down and leave a message for results.  Never get any calls on their own.She calls in the afternoon and always gives a detailed message if I don’t answer.  She tries to explain things as best as possible and provide explainations when numbers are off which is comforting to me. Christine always calls with my levels and ensures I follow the protocol for my medications.Until my last fet they were compassionate, responsive , supportive and honest.  In my last fet  there was a new nurse and i was not impressed.  I do not think she understood my history and case and twice her instructions were wrong.  This was the first problem I ever had at the clinic.  Hannah is great. She always responded quickly and was a great resource during the process.The staff was efficient. It did seem a bit like a factory, constantly seeing a different nurse every time you came.the nurses were great! in between my 2nd and 3rd cycle dr Davis had a new nurse... i didnt really have time to meet with her- she did however give me good news every time we spoke. it was the cycle that worked.Jamie, Dr. Goldschlag's nurse, is awesome. Over 3 years I developed quite the rapport with her. She's so nice and helpful and knowledgable, although can be rushed. That's just the nature of how they run things there. Worth it to deal with. You do have different nurses call with instructions which can be a little distracting but they were always good about calling and answering my questions. I had a smooth process getting meds and refillsMy nurse was good, but she was a bit hard to reach. I find the nurses that deal with the egg donor program to be a bit more responsive.Tamara was very patient on the phone.

Shanise was the best coordinator ever!They  were more available and easier to contact than the doctor. However they change frequently and sometimes are difficult to reach.The nurses and other staff at Weill Cornell are amazing! I highly recommend the facility. Very warm, kind and professional. Overall Katie and other nurses gave instructions on time and returned calls promptly. I had a good experience with them Molly is amazing, as is the rest of the staff.  They’re so smart, knowledgeable about protocol, friendly and have amazing follow up.very nice and would answer questions no issues here.Jasminda is the reason why I saw Dr. Kashanian.
After having a negative interaction with another doctor, I called up Dr. K's office to inquire if he would be available to see us. Jasminda too 150% care of me (us). Not only was she reassuring, she was very pleasant and knowledgeable.  She truly held my hand. And sometimes you need that.Nurses were hard to get a hold of, sometimes 2-3 days to return a call. Could be very rude at times, likely due to the volume of women they saw daily. Very, very sweet and very patient. Listened to all my concerns and provided strong counsel when necessary. Instructions were clear, calm and easy. She checked in with Dr, communicated often with me. I was very nervous to go thru fertility treatments and the nurses I dealt with were very patient and kind.She was excellent at answering my questions and getting me my results.Since Dr. Reichman was a very busy doctor, we felt that the nurses were overwhelmed at times. They would take a while to get back to me if I had any questions or concerns.The nursing staff at CRM is surprisingly nice and helpful. The waits can be very long depending on what time folks come in for monitoring but each of the nurses so far has been helpfulJackie called me to remind me of my meds changing on some days. She also went out or her way to get meds shipped to NYC because they extended past my supply.  She was awesome!Wonderful staff. Always very helpful and ready to answer any questions. They were all nice but didn’t always fully answer questions which could be frustrating, also sometimes it was hard to know when my meds were really called in I never met my primary nurse in person, always communicate through phone or email.  The care coordinator are prompt on responding to  my email inquiry.  The nursing staff are ok, some are helpful in term of  answering my questions. We felt that the support staff a bit stretched and rushed.  Please add more staff.Jackie was amazing for 3 plus years.  the nurse on our last cycle was disorganized and not quite as compassionate.  I heard he has a new nurse.  We had a great experience with spandorfer nurse and the donor team.  He has a new nurse that we used for a fet...I felt that tlshe did not try to get to know me.  Also she provided incorrect instructions twice..thankfully I knew what to do and questioned it.  All the nurses at Cornell were top notch.Large facility...hard to get in touch with ur nurse.  When Kristen called with good news you heard her genuinely happy for us and she cried years of joy when speaking to her the first time after a positive test. When I called to schedule an appointment for my next cycle she insisted I bring my baby that she must meet him and was excited to hear back from me that I was starting againEveryone from Dr. Pereira's office was impeccable in their care and communication.Holly is my assigned nurse and she is the perfect complement to Dr. Melnick. She is also very receptive to questions and answers everything with a positive and very helpful attitude. She makes you feel like you're in safe hands!The nursing staff is highly organized and manage hundreds of patients. They do this while remaining compassionate.
They always care properly and promptly. Respond our requests and questions. Very knowledgeable and well experienced.Chrystal was our nurse during the treatment but we co-ordinate only on phone. We used to see different nurses during the monitoring cycles but found all of them competent and very warm. We had extremely positive experiences with the Weill Cornell Tribeca nursing staff and we can't see enough about the quality of our nurse, Christine Lu. She is extremely organized, reliable, communicative and compassionate. We looked forward to hearing from her, appreciated her thorough instructions, and always knew she had our best interest in mind. Christine was aware of the fact that we did not have our insurance was not covering our IVF treatment. As a result, she worked with us to organize our pharmacy visits and purchases to keep our costs down and avoid waste. 

We truly appreciated Christine and were so grateful for her responsive, support and endless care. 

My primary nurse was Christine, she has been amazing throughout the entire IVF journey. I got to speak with her a lot, and had tons of questions which she was always available to answer, her support and guidance were tremendous. I was quite impressed with the nursing stuff at Cornell, very well trained, caring and all of them very kind. The staff was tremendously helpful in answering questions, giving instructions and helping us identify an alternative pharmacy to receive the medications at a better cost.The nurses at Cornell were really great and friendly which is really important when coming in daily at some points. They were always prompt with their calls to report blood results and some were particularly warm and friendly.  At times it was hard to get in contact with them via phone, but they always returned your calls.My primary nurse is great overall. Most of the nursing staff at Weill-Cornell Tribeca are great; most were friendly, professional, and very kind. One nurse (name is slipping my mind) who regularly drew my blood was very kind in particular. 
I rarely saw my primary nurse and care coordinators in person, but they were available to me by phone. They are not responsive via email, phone is best.LOVED Crystal. She ALWAYS responded to my messages in a timely manner and nothing was ever too much trouble. She is communicative, extremely organized, and knowledgeable. She was always available for us to ask any questions at any time. They were all great from drawing blood to calling daily with instructions. The staff was always very careful and helpful with my personal needs and petitions. ",8.800000000000027,8.40000000000005,"[The] nurses [at Cornell Weill Fertility] are kind and knowledgeable and they walked me through every step of a very overwhelming process and were there for my via phone and email all the time - I am very thankful for their partnership. The nurses always seemed very busy and rushed. Never rushed him off and was so kind!!It wasn't as easy to develop a relationship with the nursing staff since I never saw them in person. She is beyond kind, smart and communicative. They were great to work with and when I called multiple times for follow up questions, they always called me back the same day. Hannah was who I mostly spoke to during my treatment. She was very compassionate, kind and you could tell she genuinely cared about my well-being. All of the nursing staff was excellent at returning phone calls and very compassionate (ie when they are calling to give bad news)The majority of my interactions at the office and via phone we great. Cheryl and Tamara - Dr. Goldschlag's nursing team this time is a little more haphazard, but they call me back and they seem to have things together. Hannah was always prompt and clear with follow up phone calls. I said I understood that, I just wanted to know if it was in my file because I had asked the doctor's assistant to make a note of it. She is extremely organized, reliable, communicative and compassionate."
31,Weill Cornell Medical College,clinic,"Very much like a factory - tons of people in waiting room. But, they were very efficient with the class that they offer before IVF to teach you everything. ........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................The staff is organized and friendly. The clinic is modern and clean. Appointments are timely and waiting times for bloodwork are not too long if you come early in the morning. I've heard waits are longer after 8am but have no personal experience as I always go 7-7.30am.In general I found my experience to be positive.  They see a high volume of patients but I've never had issues with wait time, they have convenient morning monitoring hours and it was great to be able to go to the UES or Tribeca office for my monitoring.  I appreciated the calls from my nurses with instructions and next steps but feel as though email communication could be helpful in communicating medicine dosages, next appointments, etc.  The billing was definitely a bit of a mess and I never felt like I had a clear understanding of what I was being billed for.   Generally the nursing staff was helpful and well informed, but sometimes did not seem to have all of the latest information. Center for Reprodictive Medicine is a large practice. Each morning the waiting room is filled with hundreds of women at various points in their fertility journey. The first morning I arrived at the clinic I was overwhelmed -- I couldn't believe how many people were in the same situation as me. As the visits turned into months of visits, I became more accustomed to the full, and eerily silent, waiting room. ...I did not like dealing with Cornell.  The staff and some of the nurses are rude.  I was definitely just a number there.  And the wait times were absurdly long. The nursing staff were helpful and always available when I had questions.The main office is crowded and lots going on because there are so many doctors and patients. People don’t give enough credit to the embryologists at clinics...I believe the best of the best are at Weill It's a factory! But they are very efficient and have good success rates. It's about finding a more experienced Doctor. The clinic is top notch and you just have to get over the factory like feeling. You get used to it after a while and it's not a big deal.Really lovely when we spoke with them. But Impossible to get a hold of; all through voicemail which is challenging for someone working >60hrs a week. Monitoring was sometimes long.  If you wanted to be in and out quickly, you arrived before it was open and waited.  Then, it could move quickly.  Otherwise, you might be there for a long time.  There were lots of women.The Tribeca office was an overall very well-run facility that was clean and well maintained.  The support staff (front desk staff, office manager, phlebotomists, and medical assistants) were all kind, patient, and lovely to work with.  It helped make the daily / frequent visits less stressful.    Friendly, kind, compassionate, thorough, knowledgable, availableGreat location, hours, response times. I always had support with questions and concerns and was able to reach Dr Reichman and his nursing staff for anything I needed. I highly recommend the tribeca location For daily monitoring the nurses were friendly and efficient. 

For my surgeries, the nursing team was extremely warm and compassionate.

For IVF specifically, the nurses were warm, knowledgeable, always answered any questions and called me back promptly. Weill Cornell Tribeca - never had to wait more than 5-15 minutes for my appointment, usually saw the doctor within moments of arriving at the office. Technicians were all amazing as were the nurses, genetic counselors, and the office staff. It makes a huge difference when you are going in frequently for monitoring before work and there isn't a long wait! I don't know how they do it, but its makes the process so pleasant! 

Weaknesses if any really was with pre certification and billing departments. I would recommend new patients take the time to ask the Tribeca office to thoroughly walk you through this process.For fertility treatments it isn't only your particular physician that matters but the quality of the whole practice.  The quality of the lab can influence results, and procedures are often completed by other doctors.  I felt really comfortable with the quality of the entire practice and got the sense that the doctors collaborated quite a bit in making decisions about patients so you got the expertise of the crowd. Being in a larger practice also had pros such as an in-house genetics counselor.  The nursing staff and admin staff were very responsive, and I always got calls back quickly when I had questions or concerns.  The only slight negative in my whole experience was that monitoring hours sometimes got backed up so there could be a bit of a wait in the mornings, but this may partially be because I tended to show up towards the end of the monitoring window.  Scheduled appointments always ran on time. Cornell Tribeca was close to where i lived and was very convenient. The receptionist all remembered my name which I don't think is easy considering they see so many people a day. The phlebotomist were always good at taking blood painlessly.its an assembly line of care - you are a number. You won't see your doctor more than once a cycle.   But they take insurance and have a good lab.  I would recommend finding something smaller with care that is more attentiveCornell has a reputation for being “the best” and attracts top talent.  The doctors and staff are at the top of their game and you should feel very confident in the trust you put in them.  It is a very busy clinic (because of their reputation) so be prepared for that - especially at the Upper East side location (the Tribeca location has a much smaller/warmer feel). Crystal and Rosie, Dr. Pfeifer's nurses are kind, responsive, and well-organized as is Hiral, her medical secretary. The nurses who called with my daily monitoring weren't as compassionate and I literally had to beg them to stay on the phone with me to answer a few basic questions about the timing of my first IUI.  Depending on the day, you see a different nurse.  
I felt like I interacted in person more with the phlebotomists (all were great except 1 without much experience who had just started after working the front desk...).  Generally they know what they are doing and many are very compassionate.  That said, this is a large facility so it's hard for them to remember every detail in this fast paced environment.  The nurses were absolutely wonderful. Upon arrival, I was always treated with respect and seen within a timely manner. My questions were always answered and my results were consistently reported when stated. This may not be a fair review as they were undergoing some changes to nursing staff while I was there.  The initial nurse that I was assigned to was great - super responsive and knew her stuff.  While the changes were occurring, there were a pool of nurses that would be in touch that were a bit challenging as they didnt always know my history and I didnt feel they were as knowledgeable as the nurse I previously worked with.  I shared my concerns with Dr. Schattman and he had me funnel most of my questions to him due to this.They were all amazing, warm and caring.I barely remember them; it was always a different person. They would just prep me for ultrasound and not say anything. They shouted your name in the waiting room and when it came to taking bloods you were passed onto another nurse who took the bloods. The nursing staff is knowledgeable and extremely capable.  That said, this is a very busy clinic.  As such, once you've started the fertility protocol, you're on a somewhat rigid and set schedule of tests and injections, and the nursing staff sometimes doesn't have a ton of time to explain things in infinite detail.  They're empathetic, but the process is such that it does feel rushed sometimes.  That said, the internet exists to do the research of the super-fine details of procedures and protocols.They were all friendly. Sometimes when calling for blood results they seem to be rushing, but if you ask questions they took the time to answer them. They were not great at keeping up with calling or refilling prescriptions BUT once you call the nursing line, they do it right away. Strengths: High level of professionalism, pristine facility, knowledgeable staff, short wait time, and kept me informed with the entire process. 
Areas of opportunity: I left the clinic with a large folder filled with information- specifically regarding payments/ insurance. I was asked to call my insurance company and read off several questions in terms of coverage for treatments and medications. I felt that it was very overwhelming and really did not anticipate having to complete such a task. 

  Mediocre. i love all of the nursing staff - they always ask how i am doing, are kind and patient. really impressed by the practice.Most of the nurses were warm and compassionate, but everyone was busy and that sometimes led to disorganization and/or curt interactions. At the end of one of my cycles, the nurses failed to call me about my pregnancy test and I had to contact the doctor on-call after the office closed to finally get my results.There are so many resource available to the patients and a range of expertise from the best doctors and fertility specialists in the industry. The clinic also tries to be very efficient with everyone's time and is understanding and courteous in their communications. Loved the Tribeca nursing staff- never had a problem with them paricularly with taking blood.  they were so compassionate and optimistic.  they had good energy.  i was so happy to see any of them when i had to do the the York Avenue office because they definitely had a better attitude!
It's such a large clinic it really depends who you get that day.  Also, this was 2010 so the staff may have changed.  Most were fine.Can expect calls with results with regularity. Easy to reach if needed Very very nice when you actually speak to them or spend time with them. Did try to accommodate as much as possible. Some were great, some were just okay. There are a lot of them and they do the best they can with the overflow of people. There was one nurse which I believe was the nurse that makes the doctor appointment that was super helpful. Any questions I had she answered to the best of her abilities.Mornings are very busy and crowded but you generally don’t wait that long. They aren’t overly strict about arriving a little late in the morning and manage to fit you in. You see whichever doctor is “on call” that day when they are monitoring you before an egg retrieval or embryo transfer. It’s a bit of a factory and you really need fo advocate for yourself. However you are getting top care in NYC. You have to stay on top of the staff to ensure you are following the right protocol. I’d double and triple check and if they mess up they are apologetic. Getting started felt like a big bureaucracy and I had lots of questions regarding insurance and things that were often difficult to get quick answers to. But, it was just because they efficiently get it all done behind the scenes. So all good in the end but stressful at first. You have to just trust that they’re taking care of medication pre authorizations, etc. Monitoring was quick and easy and the tribeca nurses are great. Didn't use the clinic. I reside in Jamaica. This question may not be applicable to me.,....,...........,..,........................,...................,...........,......,.....................,,...,..,,...,.....

....,The one thing I hate the most about the nursing team, is that you can't call and directly speak to someone. The number you dial is their VM, so you leave a message and someone calls you back. If you work, which I do, this often leads to a lot of phone tag - which is annoying to deal with while you are going through a cycle and stressed as is.The nursing staff was incredibly inconsistent.  You got calls from different nurses every day.  They lacked any ability to answer questions.  And when they did answer a question, you could never be sure they were accurate.  Over the past 4 years of treatment the nursing staff has actually gotten worse.The nursing staff was competent and warm. The receptionists were competent but seemed irked at having to do their job. The experience was hard as it was very impersonal.  That said, with such a large volume of patients the focus is almost exclusively on moving people in and out.  For this reason, I was usually in and out within 30-45 minutes.  They were all excellent. Wait times were over an hour for monitoring appointments.Weill Cornell is a big clinic, but because they see so many patients they are fantastic at gathering data and are on the forefront of innovation.  I didn't mind that the clinic was sometimes crowded; if anything, it signaled to me that it is a highly sought after clinic and that they are willing to take on any case.Husbands are not allowed in the room during transfer. More progressive clinics not only allow but encourage husbands to be present for this pivotal moment. The retrieval and transfer will be done in the hospital across the street. It is an old facility. The only issues we’ve had have been with the people working in the endrogy lab. They constantly lose paperwork and are all very young. There was also a fellow who performed a routine ultrasound who had no idea what she was doing.  Otherwise the clinic is good.Monitoring hours were very convenient and you can go to any location. Even though Weill Cornell is an international clinic.. it definitely doesn't feel like it. I felt like I had personalized attention every single visit.Every nurse I interacted with was extremely nice and warm and tried their best to make all of the procedures and needles as comfortable as possible.Weill Cornell Tribeca Office is great. Front desk staff were always helpful and friendly and I never had to wait long. Unfortunately during the weekends the monitoring takes place in the UES location which is a little more crowded.Front desk unprofessional and billing department was rude and unhelpful It was hard to get anyone to spend more than 30 seconds with me.  They were all very hurried and when I went in for monitoring the last time they were horrible.  Stabbed me with the needle and rude.Conveyor beltProfessional, quicky, compassionateThree nursing staff were all very friendly and professional Results come back later on in the day. Waiting for blood results often were after 5pm. I was sent bills without having my insurance run, and the mismanagement of some coding is a pain to get fixed. Signing in in the AM should be seamless and the machine to sign in isn’t always working or accurate Dr. Kang's assistant was great.  She was on top everything and was very helpful with all questions I had.  At first, she may come off a little short with you, but given the volume of calls and work she deals with, she is very thorough and helpful.  I felt confident with this practice.The nurses and Drs are amazing.  The billing department in a nightmare. The majority of the procedures were billed using my name and not my wife's, resulting in coverage being rejected. Over a year of trying, they still come over wrong sometimes. Organized, prompt, efficient. Easy to be a number in a large practice, but they made it work! I would Advise one to speak up and become known in the center and be gracious even when heartbroken. It’s tough for us and the team works very hard for us! They were very professional Professional
Experienced doctors
Clean facilities 
Accepts insurance
Operates generally like a well-oiled machine
Modern facilities
Range of doctors and specialties onsite and within walking distance

Weaknesses:
It’s a money making machine
Doctors don’t tailor protocols enough
No examination of nutritional or lifestyle deficiencies
The Tribeca office has an amazing nursing staff. They were always professional, friendly, and supportive. They made morning monitoring as pleasant as it could be. Super efficient! In and out with the blood work and always ready to call over a last minute drug!The nurses were all lovely and pleasant on the phone.  The results were always given in a timely fashion. I had a very good experience with the clinic. The fertility process is very emotional and stressful. I felt like that the entire staff were all very aware of that and tried their best to give you a good experience. Compared to other Clinics they are the best and most professional. They outrank NYU by far. I encountered some IVF clinics that should not be allowed to exist. It was a scary and demoralizing experience when you encounter these clinics. Weill Cornell is the best in the world with the best IVF doctors. Compassion is #1 here.Hannah was Dr. Reichman's nurse, whom I worked with before she went out on maternity leave. She was always cheerful and willing to help, but in most cases she did not know the extent of my discussions with Dr. Reichman, so I preferred to speak directly with the doctor.Overall, its hit or miss. Seems like they are usually in a rush to call or se the next patient and its hard to stop them to ask questions.I had a different nurse every time, so it's hard to say. Once I had to request a different phlebotomist because she was having so much trouble taking my blood. Honestly, my experience with them wasn't great.This is an area that could be greatly improved upon.  There should be consistency in the person you speak to during an IVF cycle.  I felt like I needed to give color on my case or background information given I was always speaking to a new person.  For my first failed transfer, the lack of compassion I received from the nurse who called to tell me my test was negative was very upsetting.  There was no emotion or feeling of empathy as she spoke to me and the call last all of 2 minutes.  At times nurses had attitudes and made you feel like you were bothering them if you called with a question.  You would always have to leave a voicemail and someone would eventually call you back.I remember Dr. Davis's manager a lot more than his nursing staff.  His office manager was excellent. The way that Cornell organizes their clinic make me so aggravated that I honestly don't think I had a main nurse. You literally never see teh same person twice- nurse or even phlebotomist. They were all.... fine. It really is truly a factory so the nurses respond to the culture that they are a part of and have no power to change. Nursing staff were all very nice. Very quick and to the point.Monitoring hours at the Tribeca office were well-run and organized.  I often went on the earlier side (i.e. At the beginning of monitoring hours) and there was very little to no wait time.  Even on days when I went later in the morning when it was busier, the staff was still very efficient and wait time was kept to a minimum.   Very organized. I had previously been at RMA and RMA had someone who helped with financial coordination a bit more, but Weill has that as well, however they have you call your insurance and confirm everything personally which took some time. Other than that, zero complaints. Clinic was very efficient with morning screenings and blood work and ultrasounds.  I never had to wait more than 30minutes.  
The billing and financial part of the clinic SUCKS! I make enough money to pay my bills in full every month AND somehow i got sent to collections not ONCE but TWICE for not paying a bill that I NEVER RECIEVED! Also - about 8 months after my Failed IVF, i received a check for over $3,000 — i must have at some point overpayed and this was the reimbursement that i recieved in the mail with no explanation.  TERRIBLE BUSINESS SERVICE.You never have to wait here. If you are leaving work and coming to clinic you will be out in less than 20-25 mins finishing your appointment. There is no wait time. The location is good, the clinic looks new and clean. 

Weaknesses - dealing with billing teamThe nursing staff is amazing! They always see me and give me a big smile and ask me questions about how I am doing. I mentioned this before, but I am very afraid of needles, and they all are so patient and sweet to me. I have even broken down in tears before when I knew my blood test was going to be negative but they know what to say and do. 
Compassionate nurses make a VERY big difference!His nurses are all great. Its a shame he doesn't act more like them. They are kind, caring and very thorough. They always take the time to walk you through everything. Lots of handholding with them. Great clinic, professional staff and the clinic itself feels clean and nice. 
The nurses were always helpful- on one occasion I needed to do the trigger shot by myself and they helped arrange a nurse to come to my apartment and help me. They were always responsive and helpful in whatever I needed. Would highly recommend them. Never really got to know anyone in particular except the front desk when I had to leave after waiting over an hour and a half and had to go to work. There was one lady who made fun of me for going to the clinic as I was told I should by dr G. for my trigger injection. The 7:30 morning monitoring time is rough if you work in the city or at a job that starts earlier. The first come first serve model is difficult to manage but most patients are courteous lining up.  Jessica at the front desk is personable and extremely helpful in getting you set up as a patient. I had limited interaction but they seemed well informed about my situation and the next steps the doctor wanted to take.Big and busy with a slight tendency to seem like a factory due to the amount of women they're treating. But underneath that facade is very competent and knowledgable team of doctors that make you feel as calm as possible during a very emotional and stressful time. The nurse had a hard time figure out how to coordinate with us because we were living overseas and did the first few days of monitoring outside of country. 

I would like to note the genetic counsel who communicated the final results to us was horrible. she had zero compassion and knowledge.  her name was Ann Carlson.  She didn't know how to explain our results and completely dismissed our results because they were abnormal.  She would make these conclusions about the embryos without any data and told us it's based on her gut feeling.  I am floored with how unprofessional she was.  You should definitely request a different genetic counselor if you go to Cornell.  She added so much stress to our process.  We deserve better.  I have never been to a medical practice that runs this smoothly- and it is remarkable given the volume of patients here. Even during monitoring visits, I was most often in-and-out. Phlebotomists, nurses, front desk lovely and always friendly and quick!I have not had any interaction with the nursing staff at this clinic as I have not
gotten past the testing stage. Generally great but I had one major problem with billing that was in contrast to what the nurse told me.
The nursing staff was always friendly and answered all of my questions when they called with test results. They were also excellent when responding to messages I left for them. Cornell is a huge and busy clinic. Nursing care was not personalized for me, but most were nice and helpful. Sometimes I felt there was some miscommunication, so I felt it was important to advocate for yourself as a patient.
I didn’t always feel like they were the best or most efficient communicators. I often waited until 5-6pm to get instructions; and even waited till that time for results of a pregnancy test. When I called and left messages w questions they  typically called back within a few hours. There were times I was given misinformation and had to push/ask them to clarify w the doctor because the nurse told me something different than he said earlier that same day. Karla and Kristin were wonderful, as were all the nurses. Past experiences have left much to be desired, but not at Dr. Pereira's office. They were kind, understanding, patient, and knowledgeable. The nursing staff was always patient, answered all my questions, and very compassionate. I once met Crystal, and she was very kind and always explained things very well to me. They were great, really responsive and nice and friendly. Strengths- The people who work there are very nice, friendly and good at their jobs- super helpful with billing and insurance issues. 
The office is very welcoming, clean and new. 
Weakness- Sometimes very crowded during monitoring hours but for the most part can be in and out in a half hour. Thus far in my treatment at CRM, I have not felt like I had one particular assigned nurse or clinical coordinator.  Would be really helpful for them to establish a single point of contact up front for clinical questions/issues, and in particular if you could communicate with them more directly via email, secure message etc.  Sometimes you are not in a workspace conducive to being on the phone talking about your treatment, and at those times having an alternate method by which to communicate with their staff would be invaluable.Nurses are very kind, warm, and have positive energy.   It’s hard to go through cycle. But at least they seem to understand our pain and try to put efforts to minimize the pain.  I really feel thankful to them. The clinic is definitely a well-run factory but I really loved that. It was super efficient and I appreciated how they were able to see so many patients on a daily basis. It's definitely a great choice for anyone who appreciates efficiency and doesn't necessarily need too much hand-holding.This is the best clinic and best experience for me. The staff consists of professionals only. Very kind and respectful people. All my questions were answered, all my concerns were addressed. Most of all, they are extremely organized, you know every step you have to take. They create individual plan for you which suits you and your needs.  You will never feel alone, abundant, or mistreated. Strong Knowledge base. Clean facility. Reception staff could be friendlier. They do see lots of women. Be sure to Arrive early to avoid a wait on bloodwork/ultrasound days. Keep track of billing. It can get confusing. Respectful, responsive. General monitoring hours were early morning approximately 7-8:30am. Extremely smooth process at Tribeca, no long waits, generally called within a few minutes for bloodwork, and then shortly thereafter would see the doctor. If monitoring needed to happen over the weekend, you have to go to the UES office, where there was typically a slightly longer wait but never too long there either. Occasionally there was a long wait, but I think that may have been partially because I tended to arrive at the end of the monitoring window, which was the busiest time. It was fine. If you got there early then you were out early. I always came in around 8-8:15ish and was out before 9am. That meaning i had my ultrasound, blood work & saw Dr. P. The nurses were wonderful. After every visit I had blood work they would call in the afternoon to review results. They were always very patient and answered every single question. When I would call up to ask a question, I always got a call back the next visit day. In the rare event they couldn't answer a question, they would always confer with Dr. Reichman and call me back with the answerThere are many nurses in the clinic, so it is somewhat hard to keep track of which ones are more compassionate or helpful.  The trigger shot was administered by a nurse and she was very kind, asking how i preferred to receive the shot (countdown, no talking, etc.).  Also, when we did not conceive the nursing staff showed a lot of compassion stating that they were sorry we were not successful and asking if we wanted to continue or take a break.  All nursing staff has been very professional, compassionate and knowledgeable. I always felt like I could ask questions. I have been very impressed with my continuum of care when I see new nurses on a regular basis.One of the difficulties of this clinic is that there are multiple locations. While this can be convenient for monitoring (I've gone to three locations to accommodate my schedule) it does mean information can fall through the cracks between offices. The biggest pain point in using this clinic is they are totally clueless on making the consent process go smoothly. On each of our three retrievals they have always requested some new consent at the 11th hour that causes tremendous stress for my husband and me. It makes no sense that I can be at one of their offices every single day and without fail they have some urgent need for a form less than 24 hours before retrieval. To try to make the third time the charm, my husband accompanied me to their UES location so we could meet personally with the consent person and ensure every form was signed and appropriately witnessed. We even told her if there were forms we might need that she wasn't sure about we'd be happy to submit those for safekeeping. Even still, we were made aware of more forms that needed to be signed and witnessed four days later and another form a day after that. They know this is a problem and don't care enough to fix it.Cornell is one of the leading fertility clinics in the US for good reason. It is a well-oiled machine and the lab is extraordinary. The classes and genetic counseling in order to start IVF were organized and easy to sign up for. I loved going to the Tribeca office, which I felt was a warmer, friendlier environment than the main UES office, and more organized. I also felt like the wait times were much less at Tribeca, I don't think I ever went more than 10-15 minutes past my appointment time before being taken back. Also the patient coordinator, Amanda is excellent. She was always reachable and extremely helpful. Don't be afraid to call or email with any questions!I spoke with two different nurses from the office of Dr.Davis.  Both of them knew my case and clarified my misunderstanding.  It required me to study all documents they sent to us about the IVF cycle.   The nursing staff was abrupt but informative if you pressed them.  Sometimes I felt like an intrusion.  When we first started with the clinic the main nurse we were dealing with as part of Dr. Goldschlag’s team was not the nicest and easily frustrated. I don’t believe she is currently at the clinic and since that time the nurses have been friendly and willing to answer questions and work with us.I didn’t forge any relationship wit the nursing staff, they vary as did the quality of their communication. They called every day and always returned voice mails. The nurses are great.  Slightly frazzled, lots going on.  But they are caring, compassionate and smart.  I liked them better than my doctor, to be honest.The nursing staff at the Tribeca office is warm and caring.  My first IVF coordinator was cold and businesslike.  The second one was much more pleasant and helpful.They have made mistakes. Often i ask them to double check with dr Davis and their directions would change as a result. They did not seem to be able to answer my questions. Generally unimpressed. I had Katie last time and i thought she was on top of things. This time the nurses keep changing and i have not being impressed.My nurses for my retrieval and first two transfers were great. Compassionate and happy to answer questions. With my last transfer, it seemed like I had a different nurse every time I called or was called back. And none of them were the same as my first transfers.  That just meant that I felt like I was being passed off. Crystal was always good, but I think they switched her off my care at some point and I got people who didn't always seem to know what they were doing. I didn't have a great deal of interaction with the nursing staff, as I did not undergo IVF.  I called a few times with questions, and they were very helpful in their responses.  I wasn't assigned a specific nurse, but when you start treatment at CRM, you receive contact information for your specific doctor's team, including nurses whose duties are divided and specified.  The nurse I typically reached out to (based on these descriptions) was frequently out of the office (it was during the summer, so this may not be the case year-round).  When I left messages on Dr. Reichman's general nursing line, however, they were always quick to call back.Monitoring appointments were early morning and fairly calm at Cornell’s Tribeca office.  Dr. Reichman did every ultrasound himself.  On the few occasions I had to go to the Upper East Side office for monitoring, it was a “cattle call.”  But, a small price to pay for world-class care. I have a hard time with them. I always feel like i am bothering them, and when they call me with results or instructions I'm just another thing on their list to cross off. I wish I was given one person to reach out to from the very beginning (not just for those who are on IVF...anyone going through this needs help not just IVF patients) who would make me feel comfortable and free to ask any questions to.Cornell is truly one of the best. They are efficient, they are friendly, they are professional and they get results. If you're looking for hand holding, this isn't the place to get it. 
The nursing staff is overwhelmed, so you have to be persistent. They don't use email, which can be really annoying if you have a quick question. 
I found the doctors to be cutting edge, thoughtful and very professional. I really appreciated that they don't take a one size fits all approach and tailored the protocol to me and my specific challenges. After seeing 2 other doctors at 2 other practices, Cornell was the only place where we ended up having success.  Love having the Tribeca office available for most appointments but going to the UES location for weekend monitoring early in the morning and for the IUI was much less convenient. The UES office also doesn't really explain what you need to do and where you need to go for IUI - for example, sign in on 6th floor, then wait on 7th floor for husband's sample to be prepared, then carry it back down to 6th floor and check back in. That said, blood tests always seem to go quickly and waits are not long for AM monitoring. Clinic is known to treat difficult fertility problems.  
They function like a machine and clearly have a high volume of patients.  
I liked that they had clear procedures in place... others feel like it's a factory.  
The nursing staff was very responsive, and communicated well. They also were great when I had questions, and answered them fully. They were personable even though they see tons of women each day!The office is very welcoming and informative. Having commuted more than 40 miles per day for my visits, the office staff was always most accommodating in meeting my desired appointment times.  My questions were always answered and follow up calls were made within a timely manner. Nice, pleasant. Promptly called. But again have to be your own advocate.Always called the same day with test results and explained them very well, very proactive with appointment scheduling for the next visitThe nursing staff is good, but you have to really be your own advocate as a patient as it is a big clinic and they are managing a LOT of patients.  You almost always have to leave messages, so it is up to you to be on top of questions to give them ample time to get back to you.Wonderful! Pleasant, responsive and caring.The nurse was good about giving you a calendar to start and keep track of things.  The nurses were generally good with phone calls and emails.  When I had bleeding and clotting during my 2ww while doing progesterone injections, no one I could reach on the emergency line could explain to me why.  The clinic is definitely packed and can sometimes be challenging but I do believe there is a reason that all of these people are there.  I researched a few other clinics before choosing Cornell as it felt clean, the people that worked there were nice and they knew what they were doing.  I would recommend getting there as early as possible to beat the rush - otherwise you will end up sitting there for awhile!I found the nursing staff at Cornell to be hit or miss. Some of the nurses are super on top of things, promptly return phone calls, and are great at building a a semblance of a relationship.

Others have been awful, providing incorrect instructions, taking forever to call back, seeming very overworked and stressed.

The nurses also rotate so frequently that it is hard to build real, caring relationships. And, it is extremely frustrating that you can NEVER reach anyone directly.

WARRIOR REVIEWI didn't really deal with the nursing staff that much. I mostly communicated directly with Dr. Reichman in person or over email for my issues. I actually went to Dr. Reichman specifically because I wanted ONE person who would be dealing with my thin uterine lining plus fluid situation. I was really tired of seeing different doctors and nurses each of whom would invariably say something different and bad about my uterus and didn't really understand my medical history.They were professional and returned calls in a timely manner.Cornell is the only clinic I worked with so I do not have a point of comparison with other clinics, but I found my experience to be a very positive one in general. As everyone notes, it runs very smoothly for a high volume clinic and the staff, doctors, equipment and facilities are all top notch. Monitoring hours are early enough that I was rarely late to work. Its true that it is not a hand holding clinic. I watched Freedom Med Teach tutorials on injections, researched the protocols my doctor had me on, called the nursing staff if I was unclear on any instructions and was reached out if i had any questions or concerns that weren't addressed in regular interactions. The need for self-initiative did not bother me personally. But if you are a person who is looking for a very tailored and guided experience this may not be the right clinic for you. I worked with Amy and Sarah. Amy is the NP at the Long Island office and Sarah is the NP at the NYC location. Amy led the IVF teach class and showed me how to use and administer my medications, as well as walked me through my protocol. She was always available to answer any questions I had, and if not, I would leave messages for Sarah, who would return my calls within a few hours in the same day. They were both very understanding when my insurance cap for medications ran out, and adjusted my prescription orders where necessary. Without them, I think I would have been so lost.Nurses were fine- nothing memorable, nothing bad.  Far kinder than the Dr. himself. The nursing staff was polite, professional and friendly. They always greeted me with a smile; spoke encouragingly each time i had to go for my blood work and ultrasound.You will not meet with your doctor each time. For the early part of your monitoring, it will be done by a fellow (usually in their first year). As it gets closer to retrieval, you will be seen by an attending. For the actual retrieval, there is a rotation of attendings. They are very well organized for a very busy clinic. You feel like you’ll wait forever but it goes very quickly. The clinic is clean and nice. It is also easy to find and get to. They are always available for any questions you may have and are polite. Strengths; academic institute with apparently good success rates-active research programs 
Weaknesses; waiting room etiquette is outrageous. It is like a cattle mart of women and the nurses come out and shout your name. When you go inside it is in and out as fast as possible. There is no humanized aspect to their approach whatsoever. No real point-person. One particular nurse was lazy, would have me coordinate directly with pharmacy to obtain contact info and  to confirm they received the prescription. They were fine. Gave us privacy as a couple without us having to ask for it. Did the bloodwork very efficiently. Remembered us (big deal in a huge clinic like this!)Nurse would contradict doctor's rationale as to IUI timing or timing and safety of mock trial transfer (do it during an IUI cycle after the IUI without caring about introducing an infection into the uterus while I might be pregnant).I was always able to call with questions. Someone always got back to me in a timely manner. Instructions were always left on time, always very clear, and it was easy to get someone to call me back if I had a question.  I didn't have just one nurse though - it varied a lot from day to day.  But I was OK with that.It is a large clinic.  Some days the wait time is long for monitoring, but the earlier you arrive the shorter the wait time. They were just really efficient organized professional .There were ""monitoring hours,"" but since I was working full time, the early morning window didn't bother me. It was a pretty crowded waiting room, but organized and serene. Check-in was done by a personalized card with a barcode each patient had, which was really efficient. I never found myself waiting excessively, even when it was especially crowded.Some were more compassionate than others. Some were better at drawing blood than others. Overall, you're experience with them is limited, short spurts but they were great.I did most of my monitoring (generally Monday through Friday) in the Mt. Kisco (Westchester) office. They always started with blood work first. Because it is a smaller office, there is only one technician (or there was only one technician when I was there in the summer-fall 2013). There would be a wait for blood work but it wasn't so bad. If I got there around 7:45am, a half hour before Dr. Elias even arrived, then I would be among the first to be seen. Dr. Elias is there Monday-Thursday for ultrasounds for those who need them (not for every monitoring appointment). He has an ultrasound technician there on Fridays to cover for him. On weekends and holidays, I had to travel to the upper east side of Manhattan to be seen in the main hospital. Of course that is quite busy because it is a NY hospital. It's kind of like a cattle call, but I accepted it as just something that goes along with being a patient at a top notch hospital! There was a morning window, so I could go when convenient.  The waiting area is very busy, so that does not feel personal at all, but they were orderly and efficient and the wait was not excessive.  The waiting area has comfortable seats, water and plenty of reading materials.The clinic - at least when I went there a few years ago - was truly state-of-the-art.  They really seemed to have everything under control and orderly, from making appointments, to timing of all the medical aspects, to moving patients through the process.They were very good and pleasant.  The nurses/PAs who did most of my IUIs (Dr. Davis did a few, too) were lovely.They stayed in contact & suported when we needed them. This was when I had first gotten a smartphone & was still amazed at how useful texts could be...the appointment coordinator for the co-culture biopsies was super helpful. Check in is pretty quick and waiting is not too long. Monitoring is an easy experience. If you want to talk to a nurse during monitoring you need to ask the person taking blood and they will put you on a list for the nurse to come out and talk to you. Doctors are all pretty friendly and kind. They all seem to take time to answer questions. 
The nurse phone line is mostly a recording but they answer your call pretty quickly. Receptionists are not the friendliest. Nurses always promptly return calls and leave very specific easy to follow voicemails! The Tribeca location is new, clean, and well-run. I rarely had to wait more than five minutes to be called into my appt or to have blood drawn. Front desk staff and nurses were also all great. Since you do have to visit the office frequently, it makes sense to pick a location close to your home if you can, but luckily I live downtown.They are all so nice - they smile and are patient and caring.  I was really impressed with the level of care.The billing department is unprofessional; was constantly sent bills for services that were already paid and they did nothing to rectify even after calling them about it. Never returned calls either. Even the medical records department gave me attitude for simple matters. I really feel like Cornell has some of the best facilities and makes you feel like you are in good hands. I prefer the Tribeca location because it is less cattle call-ish during monitoring hours. The staff is incredibly caring and get to know you. The clinic is efficient, well organized, clean and comfortable. The staff are great. And I can imagine you might be surprised by the amount of people in the waiting room, but they have a great system in place and you never have to wait too long.The offices are clean and spacious, and for the most part, everyone is very professional. For daily monitoring, it is helpful that they have multiple locations (Tribeca, NJ). But the volume of patients is very high so it is easy to feel like a number, and wait times are often extremely long.The clinic is very organized and provides all necessary information. Morning monitoring is crowded, but efficient. It can be difficult to call the nurses directly, but the generally return calls within a few hours. The after-hours answering service is terrible. The nursing staff seemed pretty good in the main NYC office. However, the staff  at the Westchester office is terrible! So much so that one of the times I had called for just rescheduling an appointment, one of the two staff members there pretended to be the other. Extremely unprofessional (I also work in healthcare). You are assigned one nurse, who always meets with you and responds to all of your calls, which is great. The nurse was knowledgeable, helpful and very responsive. It was a fairly efficient process of first come, first serve for monitoring appointments, which seemed to work well and you knew what to expect -- if you got there late, it would typically be more crowded and you would have to wait longer. tribeca's office and staff were great- during holidays or weekends, all patients have to go to the Upper East Side office for daily monitoring or any procedures.  the upper east side is a cornucopia of women of all sorts but they also include the really demanding types.  sometimes the waiting room is so full that there aren't available seats!They were more like educators and coordinators.  Their schedules were very confusing, difficult to figure out who to call when. When I went for the ""teach"" class where they show you how to inject yourself with Gonal-F and HCG, the nurses were spot on when I said I was a single mother by choice and immediately tailored how to inject HCG to me--injecting in the front of my thigh (as opposed to the tush) and writing a prescription for a shorter needleCornell has a great reputation - but all the doctors are not created equal.  The MD I really wanted to see had a long wait and also did not take my insurance.  Dr. S had some good reviews so I went with him.  Sometimes you have to realize that you have to see for yourself how you get along with a particular doctor -everyone is different and has different expectations..  Cornell does have that factory feel - so if you need your hand held I would recommend checking out other places...Many patients but everyone works quickly and fluidly. Phlebotomy is good, Andrology lab is in the same building. Wait times are reasonable and the monitoring hours are 6:30 to 8:30am daily 

Would recommend them to others but the waiting room does sometimes have children or reading material related to pregnancy Like most clinics, feels like a factory. Often felt like right hand wasn’t talking to the left hand. Billing could use some improvement - told me the day before retrieval that none of my last 2 weeks of treatment was covered and I owed $18K!!!! Also, they call out your full name to the very large waiting room every morning - ZERO privacy. They also take you back, with 3 other women, to a sub-room just outside of the operating room, before retrieval. No tv, no phones, not even a clock. And you watch all of the women leave, one at a time, and get rolled out of the OR on a gurney, still under anesthesia. It is so absolutely inhumane, especially with women at such a fragile time.My wife said when meeting with the nurse before scheduling IVF that she felt well informed and that the nurse was amazing.There is a rotating team of nurses that are always friendly, reliable, and professional. Really lovely team at the Tribeca office. Uptown was a little bit more hit and miss because there are so many patients and nurses (although they were overall very good). I would say the strength is that’s they are on top of everything. Weakness is that embryologist don’t always give as much updates as you would like. I want always aware of some of my embryos not making it to freeze. My husband had to call to find out. I would really love to speak to embryologist directly to understand what’s going on. It was busy all the time, they got you in and out. Somewhat organized but some things did slip through the cracks. You have to be your own advocate and push and ask questions and make phone calls all the time. No one is going to look out for you, because your one of 100's.The clinic offers early morning hours so you can do routine daily visits before work. However, it is a popular clinic so the early morning waiting room can get very full very quickly. WC is well organized and the staff is knowledgeable. Variable - many nursesThey were fine, but the time with the nurses was always very quick. Somebody from the nursing team would call everyday to tell you the doses of the injections.Returned calls same day. Always pleasant and friendly in the clinic. They were open early hours and the blood work and everything was done quick. I was able to get to work on time. There is some wait time for the dr to do the ultrasound but overall it wasn’t too long. It was a very crowded office. And sometimes it did feel like next next kind of thing. But some of the nurses were great overall. I think maybe offer financing or provide options. Overall not a bad clinic. It is somewhat of a cattle call with absolutely no anonymity. Everyone waits together in a large waiting area and they call your name. I found it comforting to see so many other women and couples there. They're missing a sensitivity chip.  No one has IVF because its been easy for them. I have had 3 miscarriages and a baby die at 3 days old.  I don't need to be treated with kid gloves, but they could be sensitive when delivering bad news and also not deliver inaccurate assessments on a pregnancy.Molly is great. Kind and helpful. The others varyThe nurses were very compassionate. They remembered my case and seemed to really care about my outcomes.Well oiled machine 6:30-8:30. Is often go right at 8:25 and never waited long. The weekends you must go to the UES. It’s a longer wait. The nursing stuff treated me as a number. They were never available They were kind and nurturing especially when I came by to be monitored and especially when drawing blood.Well oiled machine! Monitoring hours in NYC can have very long wait time! I typically waitied at least 1 hourStrengths are it is one of the best labs in the country and they have a very high success rate.  Weaknesses are little to no personal skills and you get almost zero information.  When asking for information you are treated poorly or given wrong information (not by doctor but by nurses)The nurses were always very friendly and organized. They are caring and extremely attentive. I always went in super early to avoid the line. Sometimes the wait is pretty long no matter what you do. the financial staff is a little rude but everyone else is great.They, along with NYU, are the two NYC fertility powerhouses. Mass processing means efficiency and a system that includes lots of early morning appointments so you don’t need to miss work. 

I don’t think a “personal touch” matters as much as a good system that gets you tested and monitored and pregnant. Weill is very good at what it does. The clinic works efficiently. There are quite a few patients but everyone gets enough time with their Dr. The stuff is nice and well prepared.
Sometimes is fast, others there is some waiting time.
Routine visits are always very early in the morning.A bit of a facotry. But very organized.They showed more compassion than the doctor, but it was still like a cattle call most of the time.I don't remember any specifics, besides their being very professional. It is good to know that the Tribecca office does not actually do the IUI procedure. Also, your doctor may not necessarily do the IUI procedure on you. The billing department can be hard to get in contact with and get your issue resolved. Monitoring appointments were done in the mornings and were efficiently run.  Dr. Reichman encourages his patients to come on the earlier side - when i did so, the wait was short and it was extremely efficient.It’s a giant team and you never know who is calling from day to day with instructions but they are knowledgeable and professional. The clinic is large but not too large that it feels impersonal. I will say that I had a negative experience with the billing department. A week before retrieval, I was told that I owed a rather substantial amount of money that was not covered by insurance. I was told that unless I paid it all in advance, the doctors would not proceed with retrieval. This was a very stressful time for me and I resented being treated that way.Turned over nursing staff; replacements were not great or consistent after the original nurse left. They contradicted each other in terms of information and communication, and Dr. Schattman had to step in and clarify several times.Generally compassionate, friendly, care about your outcome, skilled phlebotomistsOften times the nursing staff gave contradicting information to the dr I saw that morning during monitoring. I had to advocate for myself and make sure the direction was proper. Clinic is well organized, quick to communicate, comfortable, clean, and supportive. Strengths:  Huge clinic, has had experience with everything, lots of different doctors to consult with for opinions.  

Weakness:  Mad house for monitoring hours, not a lot of specialized patient attentionIt seemed to be a well oiled machine. All the nurses were so wonderful and caring, I am not an easy stick and they all knew me and knew exactly what to do.It's clean, comfortable, and usually very prompt. They have a large team and all really seem to care.I don't live in city so that was the difficult part. The sonos and blood work had to be done early in morning. But they were so organized and I never felt I had to wait too long even though there were hundred of woman there The nurse always returns your phone call and is thorough and clear and doesn’t rush you off the phone. A weakness is that it is hard to reach the actual
Office but you will receive a call back if you leave a message. They are very responsive to al emails. Execellent. Always called in a timely fashionthey were kindI only gave blood once, they were kind and it was easy enough.They really care for every single patient. They go above and beyond to make sure you feel comfortable. They treat every girl like a human and not just another number in the door. They are incredibly accurate, always on time and helpful. Dr. Pereira is also supported by a fantastic team of smart, compassionate and personable staff – they truly take the time to get to know you, address you by name and are always smiling which after months of early morning appointments really helps to keep your spirits high.  Moreover, a daily phone call from a friendly and familiar team member or Dr. Pereira himself (on occasion) to discuss bloodwork results allows for personalized care.The nurses were OK. I wish Cornell would join this century and use electronic communications instead of calling to give me instructions. They have a very busy nursing staff, but  Nurses are helpful, organized and keen to help. Only strengths, it’s great!  Like I said, I’ve been to 3 others, none compared or came close! 
They were professional, compassionate, organized & so well-run.  I was able to go in early am & able to get to work on time. Very friendly and helpful. The receptionists could be more compassionate and friendly but they were typically timely and efficient. Appointments were easy to make via phone or email and their response times were good. 

The receptionists could be more compassionate and friendly but they were typically timely and efficient. Appointments were easy to make via phone or email and their response times were good. Dr. Pereira's staff were always professional, courteous, and compassionate. It was such a pleasant experience dealing with them.They were right onnpoint and efficient in calling names and doing the process i was in and out in great time. They need to spend at least a minute with each person to us feel more confortable and caring The clinic is very clean and I never wait for my appointment. The staff is super friendly and you feel comfortable even when you are not at your best. Has a sense of home. It’s also convenient when you need to do bloodwork, you can do everything at the office instead of having to go to a lab. Friendly office staff. Jessica helps me with scheduling and other important things like dealing with insurance. I wish monitoring hours started earlier. There is ample parking. Check in process is easy. The phlebotomist was nice. The front desk person was rude on occasion and very impersonal to the point I actually left a comment in the suggestion box at the practice while still there. The clinic is located in a very safe and easily accessible area with lots of parking!  It's always very clean and the environment is warm and friendly.  The waiting rooms are all very well stocked and very cleanFirst come, first serve. Hours for monitoring are good. Doctors almost always are available. Good with working with billing and help to work with insurance. They provide a lot of documentation to help you navigate the entire process. Very good about contacting you.Professional and kind Amazing lab and so well organized but...very slow. Prepare to wait for all of your appointments.  It’s a cattle call system.  Procedures are also very long because of the admitting process. I would recommend The clinic environment is very welcoming love it and would tell anyone to go there. People at the main lobby greet you and make sure that you know where to go. I live the fact the have refreshments and it’s very private area EfficientThe nursing staff in Tribeca was fabulous. They are all kind, organized, and efficient. While I was not assigned to one specific nurse during my treatment, I saw a number of different ones, all of whom were lovely. The nursing staff worked quickly and all had a great bedside manner.  They called the same day with blood test results and delivered information clearly and kindly - whether it was good or bad news.They were always friendly and professional. The standards are so high at Weill Cornell Tribeca, everyone working there is top notch. The Tribeca clinic was clean and all staff from front desk personnel to coordinators and nurses were always professional and friendly. One tip though is that if you're waiting more than 15 minutes for bloodwork, let them know right away and they'll be sure to get you in there ASAP. I loved the walk in hours at the clinic, but, sometimes waiting for bloodwork was grueling.  And I just wondered why I had woken up so early just to sit in the office waiting for bloodwork.  Overall, I would say the clinic was very organized, clean, and as nice of an environment as you could expect for a medical fertility clinic. At the tribeca office I never had to wait very long. However, the main office on the weekend gets crowded. I still feel like they were very organized and things moved well. You will always see your doctor for checkups. They are not done my a nurse or random doctor like other clinics. The only exception may be the weekend - but even then I was lucky enough to see my doctor. 
The retrieval and transfer are typically done by the doctor that is assigned to the OR that day. I had dr. P for my retrieval but someone else for the transfer. I forgot the name of the doctor that did my transfer, but he was very knowledgeable and comforting as well.Overall our experience was wonderful with the nursing team. They were diligent and helpful and always accessible.The nursing staff are amazing.  The whole team is organized and professional.  They are friendly and take their time with you.  They smile when they greet you.  They actually seem like they love their jobs.  Nobody has ever been rude, unfriendly, or unkind.  They promptly return calls and walk through each step to take next.  They make sure they consult with the physician and know every necessary detail before they contact you.  Each conversation or given direction was executed professionally and accurately.  They're knowledge and dedication make every experience and visit run very smooth.  Very efficient, cost effective and you felt like they were very educational. They wants the positive results but weren't driven by the money gained from it. They were honest about possibilities and managing expectations. If they felt it was too risky they wouldn't push for the procedure just for financial benefit.They were all so kind.  They knew your name, were always friendly and in time - honestly nothing bad to say about the practice at all.They were great.I never waited for more than a couple of minutes to be seen and if I was early I would be taken early.  The waiting room is big, bright and clean.  The front desk staff is helpful and friendly and make you feel welcome when you come in.Most of the time it was very fast and efficient.  I liked to go towards the end of monitoring hours which was around 8:30am. Just as knowledgeable as the doctor but not as warm. The clinic is extremely well run, clean and modern. The front desk staff are polite and efficient, and the waiting times are very short. The staff are friendly and professional and inspire confidence. The environment is comfortable. everyone was very friendly even though it would be before 7 or 8am each time I was there!  everyone was helpful, wished me well and then was so kind when I ""graduated"" from testing at 9 weeks :)Cornell is a bit of a factory but they have their act together.  If you are with an incredible doctor like we were than it doesn't matter how large it is.  They are a fantastic research institution and you are in good hands at Cornell.Weill Cornell - Tribeca is very clean and well organized facility. The staff at the reception is also warm and well mannered. They treat patients with care and compassion. I recommend them to anyone seeking a fertility specialiat clinic. They managed the wait times well, and always answered any questions. Dr. Pereira's team is excellent. Always called back promptly, answered all questions, made the entire process as easy as they possibly could.Strength:
Good appointment schedules
No long time of waiting except if there’s any emergency happened with the doctor
Clean and well organized clinic
Weaknesses:
Non except you should make sure to sign all the papers required before any procedure (egg retrieval, or laparoscopy , embryo transfer etc). Or they will ask you to go back to the office even if they forget it until the day of the procedure! But thangs god the doctor is  conscious  And helpful incase anything like that happened.The clinic has a lot patients, but they are extraordinarily well-organized and run the clinic proficiently and professionally. Despite volume, you never feel like a number with the staff. The earlier you arrive for daily monitoring, the quicker you will finish the process. That said, it is remarkable how efficient they are.They were always very friendly and informative. And they always called promptly with blood test results.Everyone was warm, friendly and helpful. Helpful, communicative, nice bedside manner.We loved the Tribeca office. It was a 5 minute walk from my office which was huge, but I would have traveled much further for the care I received there. Every team member, whether it be a receptionist or nurse, was always patient and kind which makes a big difference when you are struggling with infertility and have to trek in so often. It was never lost on me how hard they work and how many vulerable and anxious patients they deal with all day, and yet they were still always so pleasant. I had to go to the UES location a couple of times on weekends and it made me appreciate Tribeca even more, which feels much more intimate and way less overwhelming.I really like the clinic! The wait times were never bad, despite lots of patients coming and going. The clinic itself is clean and nice. It was astonishing how crowded the waiting room was at the Upper East Side office during weekend monitoring hours, but even there I didn't wait for too long. Weill Cornell Tribeca - biggest pro is that the physician performs the monitoring ultrasounds. I was able to see Dr. Reichman at almost every single monitoring appointment during the week. In addition, the clinic is clean, and the calls from nurses during the cycle are consistent and organized. Front desk is very friendly. I chose this clinic due to early monitoring hours before work, and the fact that it was a 5 minute walk from my apartment.

Weakness: you do not get to see your doctor on weekends and holidays unless he/she happens to be on call. My weekend treks up to the UES office were always much worse experiences (i.e., longer wait times, unfamiliar physicians, and several incompetent nurses).Strengths: clinic physically is clean and spacious. They have a separate area for doctor's appointment and during ""monitoring hours"". During monitoring hours, They also have a ""card"" system where you just swipe your card and let them know you have arrived. You don't have to fall in line to ""register"". The egg retrieval and embryo transfer are done in a hospital setting. What I also like it that they have a ""pre-op"" class prior to the egg retrieval, they check your labs, vitals"". 
Weakness: Speaking to billing might not be private. Clinic could get crowded during the monitoring hours. Some receptionist in the front could be more friendlier. Weaknesses: The billing team and clinic are very separate and they don't communicate with one another. Unnecessary hoops for ""veteran IVFer's"" to jump through, like their IVF class, retrieval class in the city, etc. Its like they have unrealistic expectations on the amount of time their demands waste on the patients lives. For instance, a trigger shot may be administered at 12 midnight, then they expect the patient to come into the city for a 6am class - regardless of where you live so you may be coming from hours away, need to drive (awful parking) or take a train (horrible schedule at that time). Meaning you get 1 hour of sleep and they just tell you to deal with it.Cornell has a research profile and reputation that is nearly unmatched, as far as I can tell. And I know colleagues who have found success there. But I experienced it as a large, impersonal practice, which very little investment in whether or not I personally had a successful outcome. At the beginning of this process I thought I didn't need compassionate care if the research chops were there, but over time and repeated failures my needs changed, and I completed treatment elsewhere.Weill Cornell Reproductive Medicine is a top center for infertility. As I said we traveled from PA to NY to be a patient and it was worth it in every way. I only wish we had done this from the beginning instead of wasting a year with a different RE in PA. 
Dr. Reichman's Tribeca office is absolutely wonderful. The office seems newer with state-of-the-art equipment and the most friendly staff. His staff are extremely helpful, especially if you need support dealing with prior-auths and insurance - they stepped in and before I knew it everything was handled.The Tribeca location is fantastic. It is calm, comfortable, and all new. It can get a little crowded during monitory hours but never too bad and they are really organized. The nurses are all very nice. It's so much better than the UES location! The receptionists are also very nice and helpfulThe reputation for this clinic is extremely strong in the NYC area. I know many people who have gone to this clinic and had success.  I feel like if you have a more common issue or case and can follow standard protocols, you'll be good.  The lab is also supposed to have a great reputation and rates of success.  I felt like everyone was competent and I was in good hands but often felt like I was being shuffled along due to the amount of patients.Let me start by saying that I hated pretty much everything about the way this clinic is run. it is impersonal. It is a factory but not a well oiled machine. All REs love to talk about how their labs are teh best. Literally every single RE will tell you they have the best lab. And while there are some labs that may be better than others in some ways, for the most part i think it's negligible once you get past a certain threshold of care. So I think Cornell hides behind ""we have the best lab"" argument to avoid actually providing quality continuity of care. The waiting room holds 100 people. You check in with a swipe card. It is incredibely impersonal. They do not run on time. When you get called in you will see random blood draw person- i swear I never saw teh same person twice. Then you will be assigned a room and random young dr will do your scan. I seriously had to ask a few of tehm if they were med students or not becuase tehy looked so young, and again, I never saw teh same person twice. This is a problem becuase everyone measures follicles differently and you are relying on their measurements being given to your dr to decide on what next steps are needed. So if you are deciding when to trigger and someone measures either generously or conservatively it can actually have a major impact on your outcome. I hated that I literally never saw Dr. Davis and they drs doing the scans were so clearly like- whatever- about their job. It is a factory. I also really, really have a major issue with how they handle retrievals. First of all, EVERYONE is required to come to a 6am class and sort of group blood work the day before your retrieval even if you have already done multiple retrievals. They come out with a clipboard and the order that your name goes on teh clipboard is the order that you are seen. So you sit around a conference table with all the women who are being retrieved the next day. Too bad about HIPPA and expectations of privacy- there are NONE. You could end up sitting there with your boss, or your sister in law, or your hairdresser. I actually can;t believe it's legal. Then they call yuo back one at a time to do blood and sign forms. I then refused to stay for the class ofw hat to expect becuase this was going to be by 4th or 5th retrieval which I told them. The nurses were not nice about it all and threatened to cancel my cycle if I messed up anything. I was like- you are handing me a piece of  paper with the extensive instructions of what to do. i can read and I will follow them . And then I left. Then the next day I showed up at 6am again- for a 10am retrieval- which is just obnoxious. Then again, you are called by name and given scribs to change into they put the IV in your arm. And then you are put in a waiting room with all the same women AND their partners, parents etc...  in scrubs... with an IV sticking in your arm. And you wait. Again. And then they call you by name in groups of 3 and take you to a tiny waiting room. There one at a time the anethesiologist pulls you into the hallway (i swear) to have a private converastion about any anethesia you may have. I had 2 very lovely girls I was sitting with and we kinda chatted a bit but honestly, what if you don't really want to be in scrubs with strangers having a convo right before your retrieval? Then they take you one at a time and you see whoever is on call for retrievals that day- you may or may not have ever met them. Then you go to recovery. They wake you up with mandatory pain pills and send you on your merry way. They do tell you how many eggs were retrieved and thats it. Having had a a fair amount of clinic experiences by the time I got there I had a lot of comparisons to other clinics and this model is by a loooong shot, my least favorite. I ended up moving my 10 frozen 2PNs to another clinic because I refused to ever cycle with them again. Everything about the clinic medically was incredibly organized. From scheduled appointments, to daily monitoring, it was not often we had to wait very long. I only had once instance in morning monitoring with a doctor doing the ultrasound that I felt was subpar (by only a little) to the others. But all results of morning monitoring and how well I was doing during stimulation was still ultimately in Dr. Rosenwaks’ hands.

My greatest grievance with the clinic is how billing is handled. It was ultimately a mess. They tried to tell me multiple times I had 1 IVF cycle covered by insurance. I told them we spoke with my insurance company numerous times and that was not the case. Now we have extensive bills after they submitted through insurance when we should have been considered as a patient paying out of pocket. We are still working on getting this sorted out. They operate very efficiently. Very organized. The receptionist is a very knowledgeable and helpful. She’s on top of her game when it comes to rescheduling or scheduling an appointment. She knows the medications and works with insurances to give you the best options. It was very pleased with how organized and helpful this establishment was.The clinic is state of the art. The clinic also has high tech equipment and hires a professional staff. The clinic is also clean and spacious. The clinic can get busy but I never felt like I had to wait too long. I have never waited longer than 30 minutes. If you don’t want to wait then you should get there as soon as the clinic opens. The clinic itself is a well oiled machine, everything runs smooth and efficiently. They have never failed to call me with results or instructions on treatment and I have never had to wait for more than 15 minutes for an appointment. The Tribeca office is also so clean and modern. There was rarely a long wait during monitoring hours. The clinic staff was professional and efficient. 
At the other clinic I went to, there was frequently a discrepancy between the plan I had discussed with the doctor and the plan the nurses would tell me. This never happened at Cornell. The entire team was on the same page.Cornell is an amazing practice. With offices in NYC and garden city it was very convenient. Everyone I spoke to or dealt with was amazing. I can not recommend Cornell enough. Every office was clean and every staff member was extremely helpful. Every office was able to take on many patients at once, all while giving indivualized care. Going to clinic every morning for monitoring was not fun but it was necessary. There was hardly any wait in Tribeca office but on weekends you have to go to upper east office and there you have to wait for 30+ minsThe clinic is very organized, despite having a lot of women go through I feel like I am a priority and trust everything. They have two locations one UES and one Tribeca. I actually love UES but schlep downtown to see Dr. P several times a week - he always tries to find days he is working UES so I don’t need to travel as far. We also get to go UES on the weekend trips so that is a nice treat or for IUI or spem analysis. 

The afternoon following a blood test you get a call from the office with updates on medication as well as next steps if you didn’t already discuss.  

Making an appointment is VERY easy too. DR. P has his own medical assistant, Megi. Megi is very responsive and makes it all work!!!It's a busy clinic with lots of patients - but I liked that - things moved quickly, they were efficient and they treated my time as precious as theirs. Many women including myself do this while working and traveling to these appointments and that makes that kind of well oiled machine vibe wonderful. The only thing I didn't like was going up to the UES office. The tribeca office is smaller and nicer and moves faster. Uptown was a bit of haul for us, and you need to go there occasionally on weekends or holidays. I could have lived without those uptown visits, but really that was only a few times, not the end of the world all things considered. It was also a little shocking to not know who was going to do your egg retrieval, but all the doctors in the practice are world class and we ended up liking our retrieval doctor as much as our main doctor. I liked feeling that there was a strong team looking out for us, but I know some people don't like that aspect, and I get it. The office could use updating and the front desk could you a little training in how to treat patients. The nurses are so kind and helpful, but the drs all think they are gods and are mostly men. Go to another clinic.  The staff is very efficient and the monitoring is done quickly. Strengths: The clinic is state of the art with a lot of renowned top doctors. The installations are new and the facility is sparkling clean.
Weaknesses: Because it is a top-quality institution it can get very busy, so be prepared to arrive early each time or wait.Cornell was wonderful. I find all their processes extremely efficient, not to mention the staff at theTribeca office is incredibly friendly and helpful. By the end of my year, I knew every single person’s name in the office and they felt like friends, which made all my 6:30am monitoring appointments way more enjoyable.Strengths multiple doctors. 
Weakness you may still wait to get seen for hours. You will see other doctors. I had no idea I was supposed to keep a full bladder for the iui. I had been drinking water that entire morning waiting for my husband etc but thought I should use the restroom bc I really had to go and was worried it my hurt if they had to open my cervix and didn’t want to pee on the table so I quickly ran to the bathroom. Hearing that doctor complain about me ruining her morning making her job so much harder was horrible. Making me think that bc my bladder wasn’t full I was another reason my iui failed. 
Cold voicemails to tell you that The blood test was negative for your pregnancy. I would highly recommend Weill Cornell to  everyone! The tribeca clinic was especially easy to navigate. It is smaller so more intimate. Always saw the same front desk staff as well as nurses and lab technicians. Everyone was very friendly. The office is immaculate, and also very conveniently located. My one issue was with the pre-authorization and billing departments. I had to call a lot and never got the response I needed. It often took many calls, asking for supervisors and explaining the issue over and over. My issue was related to approval, as Weill Cornell info and my insurance info did not match. It was quite upsetting to have to also deal with so much "" red tape"" at the onset of this process. Monitoring was very efficient, considering the doctor himself was doing the monitoring.  Some mornings can be busier than others but I never waited more than a half hour. Too much of a factory atmosphere. You feel like you see the entire Cornell staff for visits and retrieval.  I only saw my doctor once or twice during the actual monitoring for all three cycles. She never performed my retrievals.

I think there is some patient card to use for check in-- never offered me a card or explained what it would be used for.

We required PGD/PGS testing and was very disappointed that Cornell would not/could not work with the company that was covered by insurance. I had to go with their lab and pay $4000 (2016) out of pocket for a probe that I never got to use with Cornell.Totally professional operation, you'll be in and out in no time during monitoring, I found everyone to be very positive and friendly.  I can see why people may feel like they're a number but I count the efficiently as an absolute plus on a busy weekday morning. Facilities are great as well.The clinic is very well-run and organized. From scheduling appointments, meeting with the genetic counselor, taking the IVF class, reviewing billing questions, etc, the process ran very smoothly and we knew who to go to for specific questions. The office and equipment are fairly new and in great condition.Strengths:  The staff here are experts in their field. Morning monitoring starts at 6:30am 7 days a week, if you arrive prior to 6:30am you can sign in and sit in the waiting room - the waiting room has plenty of comfortable chairs. 

Weaknesses: The front desk staff seem unhappy. I am leaning that the treatment plan for infertility often changes over time (which is a strength), but the covering staff does not always know/clearly communicate the current plan (the weakness part).The clinic is wonderful! The staff is comprised of so many high quality people and the office runs so efficiently as a result. I've never been to a more organized doctors office. I really appreciated how easy early morning monitoring appointments were - I was typically in and out and on my way to work in 15 minutes! The facilities feel new - they are clean and modern.Strengths - physicians are making decisions as a team, excellent team based approach between the doctors and the nurses. Compassion and going above and beyond by all members of the care team, especially Shannon C. and Waleska P. 

Weaknesses - there were a few times when we felt like they dropped the ball during our first cycle. For instance, when I met with the nurse to review the IVF instructions, she mentioned consent forms and a packet/folder... we never got those though were supposed to have gotten them when checking in for the first daily monitoring appointment. Communication after cycle failure with our doctor was not great, he would say he’d need to ask the embryologists to review everything and he would really need to think about it, but did not call back with any updates. Two weeks later I finally emailed asking for an update, which was met with apologies for the late responses.   

Things a new patient would want to know - it may be busy/crowded (which was how I felt when I walked into the clinic for monitoring the first time), but they are generally a well-run clinic. Dr. Rosenwaks might not be cheery or delicate, but he is kind, compassionate, and great at what he does. Go to Cornell for their lab - we got much better fertilization rate;  They have a lot of patients cycle through so it's not as personal as a private clinic.  Don't expect to see your doctor on every monitoring appointment. He / she may not do your retrieval or transfer. each doctor only does retrieval one day a week. The tribeca office is very pleasant, clean, spacious, bright...nice artwork! Busy but you also feel like there is something personable and private. Staff friendly and positive. I can’t come up with any negatives about tribecaI have only good things to say about WCM. It was clean, the staff organized and friendly. Sometimes the waiting room was crazy crowded and you'd have to wait for a while, but to be expected in New York. The office staff was organized in explaining and obtaining the necessary paperwork. I was seen by the provider in a timely manner in relation to my appointment. I do wish that the office had a direct # that is not affiliated with the main # for NY Presby/Weill Cornell. I had received a phone call the morning of my appointment that I missed. When I called back the # I spoke to the answering service telling me the office was closed when I just received a message. If you can try to go to the Mt. Kisco office for morning monitoring because you get to see Dr. Elias for US and Blood work everyday except Thursday's and weekends.  The NYC main office is more of the factory feel and you get a different doctor or nurse each time.  They are extremely fast though because there are so many NP's there.  Amazing clinic- super kind staff, very prompt ‘service,’ extremely clean and modern facility. This is one well-oiled machine, with a very uncommon level of care and humanity. I really appreciate how quickly I could get in and out of the office, esp given the frequency of appointments.Cornell is known to be the best clinic in NYC and even the country.  While it is no secret that the Hospital Waiting room can feel cold and ""factory"" it is a small price to pay for what expertise they haveGenerally great, reception is polite although a bit hasty and patronizing -
I assume because of the volume of emotional women they deal with all day.
Wait times can be up to an hour but for the most part were very quick and I felt the clinic did all possible to mitigate waiting.
Facilities were clean and modern.
Staff was all professional and friendly.Leave messages with questions. They always call you back........…...................................       ..........….....................................................................................................I am still in my fertility journey, and after many IUI and 7 IVF, I would consider myself experienced. I have used multiple clinics for IVF and have sought multiple second opinion consults. BY FAR, my experience at Cornell with Dr. Davis has been the best.
Considering the results, the embryologist and the lab were excellent.  I would assume that my rate of conversion from egg --&gt;embryo--&gt;blast is on the higher range of success for any clinic.  Weekend monitoring on the UES was painless as the wait time was quick and the nurses always pleasant.I had issues with prior authorization for one of the medications I needed/ they totally dropped the ball on it- telling me it would take 2 weeks for an answer; when I already waited 2 weeks and needed the meds already...I needed to follow up multiple times for that to be resolved. Otherwise, I had an overall positive experience w the clinic. Strengths: Office is beautiful, Dr. P and the nurses are great. Location is easy to get to. I always felt like I had access to nurses and Dr. P. Dr. Pereira also takes early appointments, I could go before work! 

Weaknesses: wait times depending on when you go. The earlier the better. The clinic itself was great and had a pleasant and clean atmosphere.  My only criticism was the morning wait was often extremely long.  Several times I waited over an hour for them to call my name for bloodwork and ultrasounds.  The clinic at Tribeca is filled with the nicest people I have ever met. However, because of the volume at their other office at York, the same treatment is not found there. And as a patient, you will need to visit both offices. At York, the woman at the front speaks too fast and seems uninterested in speaking with others. She called me on the day that should have been my third IUI at 10:40 AM claiming that she called me and left a message at 8 AM and if I was still coming in. I never got any missed call or message (because I was hoping the clinic would call me back in time and had my phone on my person all morning) but once 9AM hit, I told my husband to just go to work because we couldn’t wait all day, plus the follicles were very small and the doctor (Dr. Reichmann) when he did my ultrasound, had no impression that I would be ready for an IUI. I was annoyed that the woman was more interested in proving she was right than realizing that I missed my third IUI. I did not express that to her, but just said that my husband had to go to work and we would not be coming in that day. I have not gone back for treatments at Weill Cornell, or any clinic for that matter, because this very last experience left me discouraged and very stressed. This is pretty much the experience I have had at every ob/gyn before switching over to a fertility clinic. I will try another fertility clinic when I am ready again in a few months, but I think all the heavy lifting needs to be done by the patient. The downtown office is smaller. Very clean and organized. You will usually always see your Dr when you go. The staff is friendly and knows your name. They always get your meds in on time. They only issue I found is it takes forever to get your records. So if you need them quickly you will have to stay on them. Strengths: After going to another clinic first, I was extremely impressed with the organization of this clinic.  Everyone is vey nice, they are efficient. Hours are great.  Never have to wait long. 

Weaknesses: They have so many patients, which sometimes makes me feel like a number. busy office and you have to come in early, sometimes a wait but never more than 30 minutes. And usually they take you within 5 mins of your arrival. ALso sometimes you have to wait in the room for the doctor to come in for 10 mins but not more. usually very fast. eveyrone who works there is really nice and friendly. This was my first experience with monitoring hours but it felt organized and fluid. Even when really busy wait was mostly 30 minutes at longest. The Tribeca office is great - nice staff, efficiently run, and very comfortable environment. I was always seen on time. The UES, where you will have to go for IUIs and on the weekends when Tribeca is closed, is less so - there's a higher volume of patients and so there's longer wait times, more anxiety in the waiting room, etc. Also know that if you're doing IUI that Dr. Reichman most likely won't be doing the procedure unless he happens to be on call - it wasn't a big deal to me and I had the same doctor do the procedure both times who was lovely. Upon initial consultation I met with the patient coordinator, Amanda, who explained all the steps I would need to take in order to begin the process. She was very patient and informative and guided me throughout. As a new patient the process can be quite daunting but she always took the time to explain everything to me thoroughly. Make sure to coordinate any insurance issues with the billing department, as that is a time consuming process.The facilities are great. The waiting area has nice light and comfortable seating. The clinic is quite big and feels very different from seeing Dr. Melnick at her office, which is a few blocks away and quite small (but, also new and very nice!).
Even though there are comfortable couches, due to it’s size - it feels like a hospital. I have had to wait quite a while a few days. My first trigger shot, I somehow ended up waiting for like 2 hours (there was a class - it is a teaching facility). After that, my husband always gave me the trigger shot. All of the staff are very nice.Weill Cornell has a large volume of patients, and it's not cheap.  But hopefully you get top notch treatment and that will make it all worthwhile.  For daily monitoring, come as early as you can (ideally before 7 AM) to get in & out more quickly.  Also, it seems in 2019 they have enhanced their financial collection efforts - I had not even invoiced yet for coinsurance from my 1st cycle and they were asking me to pay the balance prior to starting my 2nd cycle.I believe they have the latest technology. And they dealt with big numbers of cases that I feel they know what they are doing.  They are dealing with big numbers of people but quite organized. Blood works and ultrasound to monitor follicles during the cycle is very early in the morning from 6:30-8:30. This clinic strengths are that they are really advanced on a technological, medical, research basis. The lab is really amazing and always try to improve, find new treatments. If you are dealing with a severe trouble to conceive, don't hesitate one second to go to them because they will surely find a way to get out. Weaknesses are the costs of course... You have to pay for success. Some people find also that it's like a factory because there is so much women and patient who are dealing with that and sometimes you will maybe have the feeling to be treated like a number. But I will definitely tell you something, most of fertility clinics are like that. This doesn't bother me or my husband, but I can understand that some women prefer more intimacy. The clinic is amazing. All of the appointments were on time; we never had to wait in the waiting room or in examination room. The facility is modern and clean. Everyone who works at the clinic is sensitive to the issues of infertility whether they greet you or handle billing. They all seem to enjoy their job.Clean, professional, organized. Any time I needed documents or to speak with a nurse, they were very responsive. The clinic was very organized, and although there were many many patients there each and every day, the system was efficient and hardly any time waiting. It's a top clinic that is highly organized and personal at the same time. I am very pleased to have chosen Cornell. I do not have my IVF results yet, but still feel very happy with the service that Cornell provided me.Tribeca office is a great facility with relatively short wait times -- during regular monitoring hours, it took me no longer than 40 min for both ultrasound and blood work -- however, it can get crowded at times. The only thing I didn't like about the office was that it wasn't open during the weekend, so I had to go to Upper East location, where I didn't know any of the nurses. Other than that, a great facility, especially if you live near by. Cornell is an incredible clinic that is well run and while there are many women cycling I still felt that I had very personal attention (that may in part be because I primarily went to Tribeca which is a bit smaller). I feel confident in the team there. The only downside to the Tribeca office is that you have to go to UES for procedures and weekend monitoring.  I found the UES location similar to a factory.  Very impersonal, not very helpful staff, not much information or instruction.  The Tribeca office, itself, is terrific.  They run on time, they know the patients, and they quickly respond to questions.  The Tribeca office is absolutely fantastic! Facilities are very clean and wait times were minimal, even during monitoring hours which can get pretty busy if you do not arrive before 8AM.  The staff is extremely friendly and helps make you feel at ease during a difficult time, their smiles and personality make being at the doctor's very early in the morning multiple times a week much more bearable. Scheduling appointments is very easy. The office gets a bit busy after 745am, so it's always best to schedule your appointment early. The front desk staff is extremely kind and answered all my questions related to billing and scheduling procedures.  Cattle cow but that's ok because it's very busy. I wish there was more privacy instead of the receptionist asking you your business in front of other patients. Other than that, clean and efficient. To be honest it was a little reassuring going there and knowing that I was not the only one going through my problem. Cornell is a large clinic with many doctors.  Sometimes the waiting room feels impersonal and like you're ""just a number"".   We've only been to this clinic so I am not sure if that is how it is or specific to Cornell.  Organized, great hours, great staff. The clinic is modern and clean, quiet, everyone is very patient with you, caring and understanding of your needs and situation. At cCornell monitoring is super precise you go every other day or every day as needed. This clinic has been on the forefront of research and development for reproductive medicine. It's a very large clinic that has been partitioned into small practices around the city. Monitoring can take place at multiple locations. When I call I don't get to speak with someone right away but they are very consistent with calling back within a couple of hours. Monitoring is easy breezy at this location. It is not available on weekends, however.Strengths: they see a lot of patients and so they have a lot of practice doing what they do and are in many ways a well oiled machine. All doctors I saw were excellent. I didn't feel like my IVF cycle would get messed up because of human error given how often they do them.
Weaknesses: Sometimes I felt they were expecting me to end up doing IVF (which I ultimately did, but at the time I didn't appreciate that feeling). The upper east side location is extremely crowded at many of the monitoring hours. You often won't see your doctor and you'll see many different nurses. Many things you'll have to go in for are very, very early in the morning. The technology and equipment at Cornell Tribeca is state of the art all brand new. The front desk team is lovely, energetic and kind. For a smaller office the waiting area is often packed. Most days moved pretty quickly, but others I waited 45min just for blood. Communication via email or the portal could be better. Most of the time I received phone calls. Dr. Melnick's office is great, in a convenient location and runs on time. Unfortunately the procedures take place at the Center for Reproductive Medicine, which is huge and does feel like a factory. Dr. Melnick did not actually perform any of my IUIs, and the location of the hospital is not convenient. This was not properly explained to me at my initial visit, and I didn't know Dr. Melnick would not be doing the actual procedure.
I found the clinic well run.  I liked that waiting area is not too small.  This is not directly about the clinic, but we drove to the clinic so it was hard at times to find a parking space.  We used different parking facilities nearby.  I was not a fan of the clinic for IUI purposes.  I can’t comment on IVF but IUI was poorly run.  The wait is very long between arrival and the procedure and they mislead you on how long the wait will be.  A nurse, not your Dr, performs the IUI.  The third time I had the IUI done, the nurse couldn’t find my cervix and ended up injuring me.  I literally kicked her out of my body and the room and requested someone else.  The IUI process itself was so stressful that I cannot help but wonder if that was part of the reason we were not successful,Cornell is a large clinic and a well-oiled machine. They know their stuff. Monitoring generally moves very quickly, as they have a large nursing staff. A doctor almost always does all your ultrasounds, but may not always be your primary doc. Egg retrievals and transfers are done by the doc on-call that day. I found all the docs to be very good. The clinic is associated with New York Presbyterian, which I found to be an absolutely wonderful hospital. Weill Cornell is an well-functioning machine. It is extremely efficient - I was amazed by the smoothness in which monitoring hours operated and followup calls with instructions were all timely and professional. Everyone was pleasant and nice. My only critique is that it felt a tad impersonal, you know you’re one of many...no Nurse is going to remember your name or face specifically. So something to keep in mind if that’s important to you. I never felt that care or attention was lacking though.The clinics strengths is that they are organized considering the amount of patients. The weaknesses are that it can feel impersonal at times and if you are feeling sensitive about it which many people do feel about this process; this may not be the best place for you.Crowded on UES location, and they don’t allow outside lab monitoring, so no traveling if you can’t get back every other day. The tribeca location was easy and civilized and little wait but of course Dr Davis isn’t there, so i never saw him.Strength: it's a well-oiled machine. They have their protocols and follow them to a T. They also tell you in advance what problems they have with insurance so you can get everything pre-authorized before you start.

Weaknesses: it can get busy at times so either be prepared to come early or to wait.It is a factory.
On the plus side, they know what they're doing and they are efficient.
On the minus, there is not a ton of personal connection here.  The ladies behind the front desk at the monitoring station can be quite cold.  If you want warm and fuzzies, this clinic is not the place.Dr. Palermo's embryology lab met to discuss our failures, as did the andrology team.  I was told that they were devastated and stumped by our results.  Dr. Palermo offered my husband a couple of tests after our second failure.  We have yet to receive the results of the second test about 7 months later.The clinic is HUGE. If you are not ready for that, either find someplace new, or prepare yourself to advocate. If you are in their face and vocal you will have a better experience because they will know who you are. 

That being said this clinic also specializes in taking cases that no one else will touch. They are not as concerned with their success rates and only taking patients who will improve their rates, rather they are willing to give almost anyone a shot and they will adapt their protocols to meet patient's needs. 

One thing I like is that they have team meetings and come up with protocols as a team, not individual doctors making decisions on their own. This is comforting because you know that they are checking each others work. 

Something else that could be a little discomforting for patients is that because there are so many patients and the clinic is part of the hospital, not everything takes place in the clinic. Somethings take place in the radiology dept and then the lab, egg retrievals, and transfers happen in a surgical center in the hospital (I liked this because it was just IVF procedures happening there so no one else was walking in and out and you knew the nurses and front desk people did this all day every day). Also, the Andrology lab is on a different floor so you have to take the elevator and walk around with the sperm sample in a paper bag from when they give it to you to when you give it back to the nurse and have the IUI done (a little weird for people who know what is in the tube and see you walking around with it). Cornell's Tribeca office is excellent - front desk staff were always helpful and friendly and I never had to wait long. Weekend monitoring and all IUIs are done at the UES office, which is much bigger and has longer waits. Also, keep in mind that Dr. Reichman will do all of your weekday monitoring and manage your treatment, but he will not do your IUIs and probably not weekend monitoring or egg retrieval (though for weekend monitoring and egg retrieval he does some as they have a rotating schedule).Dr Davis is great and very knowledgeable. Be your own advocate with the nurses and ask questions. When necessary ask them to double check with the doctor. The billing department is inefficient and annoying.This clinic runs like a well-oiled machine. They know what they are doing and do it well. The morning bloodwork feels a bit number like--but they have a massive amount of people to get through in a short time. Tribeca is definitely better about being more human and caring than the main office in the upper east side--and it's so much more peaceful and quiet. Be aware that your doctor will not necessarily be the one doing your procedures. Each clinic's doctor is assigned to a specific day since there is only one surgical room. The doctors I've had though for retrieval and transfer have been great. Also know that your ultrasounds will not necessarily be with your doctor.  And on retrieval and transfer day...you will wait. Last time I was told to be there at the earliest time, but was the last one to go in about 3 hours later. Super annoying watching people that arrived an hour after you go in an hour before you.  The people are very compassionate and friendly. I feel everyone there is competent at their job.  I am always able to get an appointment when I need it. The fertility process is very time sensitive, so I really appreciated the coordinators making sure I get the correct meds at the correct timing.   The only weakness, is it can be difficult to get someone on the phone if you have a question.  I usually have to leave a voice mail, and then they call me back a few hours later.  It would be much easier if they communicate via email, since I can not always get to my phone if it is a busy work day.Weill Cornell is unlike any doctors office I've ever been to. It is clean, everyone is extremely friendly and remembers your name, and they are always on time. I never waited more than five minutes in the lobby before being taken back to the exam room. I trust the technical expertise of the Weill Cornell Centre for reproductive medicine completely. I trust their research and methods and skills at performing procedures. I was very happy with all procedures performed by the team of doctors including IUI, egg retrieval and transfers. 
On the other hand, the administrative/ billing team was not familiar with Aetna insurance which led to multiple, time wasting, and high stress instances of the admin team incorrectly telling me I was responsible for meds out of pocket when in fact I was 100% covered. At one point i was on vacation to de-stress from the cycles and them emailed to tell me i would be responsible for bills of $10k for medication - this was incorrect due to poor research on their part. (Dr. Reichman actually volunteered to help get it sorted by reporting the errors to the head of the Weill Cornell insurance billing team, who then worked with me directly). I also had billing issues, receiving bills for thousands of dollars, when I had already paid for a complete IVF package in full. This all got rectified, but was extremely time consuming and stressful. They have an excellent lab, are organized.  Definitely felt like a number in the NYC office, but the Mt Kisco satellite office was much more personable. Often very long waits for monitoring at the NYC upper east side and a complete cattle call. Monitoring hours were 7-9am which was tough for me to make. The Tribeca office of Weill Cornell CRM is a hidden gem.  The facilities are new, the waiting room is never packed, and the front desk staff are wonderful.  My husband and I visited the main office on the UES once, for our IUI, and it was a night-and-day contrast to Tribeca - incredibly crowded, seemingly somewhat dated, and huge.  Given the large number of doctors and patients, I would be surprised if they are able to support the same continuity of the Tribeca office (as in, always seeing your doctor for each monitoring appointment, which was amazing!).  I suppose if there is one downside to the Tribeca office, it is that on weekends, holidays, and for procedures like an IUI or embryo transfer, you will need to visit the UES location.  This is a highly professional organization.  I would recommend this clinic to anyone in the area.  They know what they doing.  Trust their process.  It works well.  The wait time to see the doctor or have blood taken was very short.  They were very responsive to questions and returned calls quickly.Amanda runs the office very efficiently and compassionately. She makes sure that we are well informed and cared for every time we visited the clinic. Amanda and the clinic staff are the main reason the clinic runs so efficiently. Whether it is the appointment schedule or billing queries she ensures all our questions are answered promptly. Shannah and others in the clinic made every visit easy for us. They always greeted with smile and compassion and make the start of your day and IVF journey cheerful. Shannah remembers everyone's name and greets them in a personalized way making the connection very honest and authentic. We have rarely sat at the reception not knowing when our turn will come, overall a great experience right from Dr. Reichman to Hannah to Amanda and othersBeing one of the best clinics, it's also one of the busiest.  It's not the place to go if you need hand holding.  Patients do not have any contact with the Embryology Lab which I found frustrating at times, but rest assured they are top notch. Dr. Palermo, the developer of ICSI is the Director of Andrology Lab here.  Your doctor can also contact the lab for any specific questions you may have.

Morning monitoring hours are extremely busy. I went between 6:30am-7:30am every morning to avoid waiting and I preferred the Tribeca location.  You need to be extremely proactive with your insurance and coverage, especially if you need anything from the Pre-Certification team, who were not very responsive and often times dropped the ball.  Others have said it and I agree. Cornell is a well oiled machine. I don't think I've had to wait more than 15 minutes to be seen for monitoring. I've found every doctor and nurse at Cornell to be genuinely kind and compassionate. Only once did I meet a doctor who seemed to be in a rush and that was Dr. Spandorfer. He wasn't unprofessional, but he seemed rushed during my ultrasound and didn't count or measure as many follicles as the other doctors. I have heard that the labs at Cornell are among the best. I have confidence in the labs, doctors and nurses at Cornell.. Cornell also does day 3 transfers and will transfer untested embryos. A friend that went to RMA said that they only transfer PGS tested embryos for women over 40. The main weakness is that everything is communicated over the phone whereas online or email would be more efficient and if you have a question for the nursing staff, you need to leave a message for them to call you back. Also, not sure other clinics do this, but the day after your trigger shot, you need to go to the York Avenue office for pre-op at 6:30am which is very early since my trigger shots were usually 11pm to 12pm.The clinic moves quickly. This is both a good thing and a bad thing. It's good if you need to get to work, but bad if you don't want to feel like a number. Always be prepared with your questions or you will be rushed out the door. It is a very well run place, where you truly feel like you are in the right place to accomplish your goals. The atmosphere can be off-putting at times, and the nurses may not be exactly how you want them to be, but at the end of the day it is a place where I feel my dreams are possible despite our fertility challenges.I like the fact that the clinic has multiple locations so it makes it easy to go to the daily appointments.  I like that there are many nursing stations to take bloodwork but also wish for a bit more privacy.

Monitoring appointments were surprisingly efficient--The earlier you arrive at Cornell, the faster you'll get through monitoring. Since we were cycling out of town, getting results from our DC clinic to NY seemed way more challenging than it should have been. But once we got to NY, everything ran pretty smoothly. I never had to wait more than 30 minutes or so in the morning, so getting to work on time was not an issue. Clinic is clean, up to date, and you are in and out in 10-15 min. Sometimes you have to go to there uptown office and they are just as fast. There is a nurse always available if you need to speak to one. Long lines but efficiently run.  I tried to come at off hours and generally was in and out.  If you come at peak times, expect to wait up to 45 minutes.  A well-oiled machine!  Busy but efficient. If you are in a hurry, best to come in at 6:30 when monitoring begins if you'd like to be seen quicker.  When Dr. Melnick wasn't available, I knew I was in good hands with the rest of the Cornell doctors and staff. Strengths: A very well-oiled machine. 

Weakness: Could feel like a factory at times. You will definitely see women you know in the waiting rooms but cannot really attribute that to the clinic perse.
Billing department is terrible. I've had to dispute every single bill I ever received from this clinic, followed by hours of agonizing calls with my insurance company. After requesting a billing audit from my insurance company, I received a refund in excess of $15K (which indicates the level of incompetence of the billing staff).The clinic is very clean, up to date, and well managed. They always called when they said they would and got back to me quickly when I left messages. They were great about answering questions regarding my cycle, billing, insurance etc. If they did not know the answer they would always put me in touch with who would know. Strengths: the clinic is clean, presentable, state of the art, accessible. They do have really good doctors that listen and seem to care when you are with them (time is limited however as they all seem to have a heavy caseload). The front desk/reception is friendly and helpful once you get to know them. They offer genetic counseling (we took advantage of it and the counselor was very informative and helpful, glad we did this). 
Weakness: when it comes to billing and insurance the patient is left on their own to tackle. When we first joined we could communicate with the clinic via email (where we could email in questions, paperwork, etc.) however in the past year they switch out to everything being handled via phone. The assigned nurse we got also refused to communicate via email preferring to do so via phone. This did not work for us due to work/school commitments, so having email communication was preferred. Another weakness would have to be that information (in our case insurance pre-requirements for IVF) never got to the right person in time, so the patient was left to do multiple follow-ups with several people about the same thing. I wish the office would be better coordinated. Strengths - Clean, timely, well located if you live downtown. I was easily able to get in at 6:45am for my bloodwork and ultrasounds if needed and out in 20 - 30 minutes. Nice waiting area, with water and a good clean bathroom. 
Weaknesses- Can't really think of one?I was lucky enough to do most of my monitoring with Dr Elias himself in Mt Kisco.  In the event it’s over a weekend or holiday and you have to go to city it definitely feels more of a factory but they are organized and it moves quickly even though you may be overwhelmed by the amount of women in the waiting room.  Same with retrieval and transfer day all done in city .. but again very organized and systematic.  But that makes it less personal I’m sure for any city patient but dr Elias mt. Kisco location is really the best The clinic handles a large amount of people. I think they do a good job of trying to get everyone in ASAP but of course there are delays and hiccups. Overall i am very happy with my experience. I think the biggest thing to take away is making sure you are ready to manage and handle a lot of questions and express any concerns. Organized, on top of your meds, consents, and reminders to get certain things done. IVF teach class was helpful where you learned how to give each shot, etc. Sometimes I felt like they asked for payment at random times and without warning. There was no set date to pay, so sometimes I wasn't asked at all and other times it was before the cycle really had even started. Overall, all the doctors who monitored me (I saw different ones if I had to go in on a weekend) were compassionate and thorough. They gave you all the details you needed and explained likely next steps, etc. Very organized - minimal wait times. I never had to wait more than 15 mins, most times I was seen right away. Though you would see a lot of people but clinic really honors the appointment schedule. Everyone from nurses to staff at the front desk have a very personable attitudeStrengths — Huge number of cycles and success. 
Weaknesses — So many cycles that you really have to be on top of things and watch everything yourself. Closely. There were several near misses. Nurses and at times, even other doctors during monitoring try to apply protocol themselves. You have to be vigilant to ensure the plan that your physician set forth is being followed. It's clean and welcoming.  
I am still not clear about the computer in the lobby, because I have never been introduce or told what to do.  The wait is not bad especially in the morning.  I think Dr. Kang is a super woman because every time I go for my visits, she is there...I always see her by herself and I don't know she does it.  The amazing this even though, she is by herself, you do not waste time. 
By the way, Jessica is very pleasant too.  she takes my blood for each visitExtremely busy, not always well coordinated, some amazing nurses and some pretty average once. Overall like any other large clinic I had been with - has good and bad sides. Over course of my treatment I really got to know some of the nurses and phlebotomists as well as attending and learned that if you request a certain doctor or attending- most of the time they will see you for your scans and that way there is a feel of some continuity through the treatment. I really like drPasternak - she was thorough and attentive with great reassuring attitude. Weill Cornell is well organized ""factory"" for IVF-- this didn't bother me much because most of the tip clinics in NYC are this way, and the quality of the lab/embryologist and doctors is what you are going there for.  That being said, you do have to be very on top of your own treatment to ensure you get what you need.All of the staff including the physicians but especially the nurses, phlebotomists, scheduling staff,  billing team and other support staff were always kind and compassionate even when we were having a tough day.  

Lovely waiting room, with very reasonable wait times.Top notch care, best doctors not the cheapest option in manhattan but the most advanced care. Tribeca office is fast, efficient and clean. Upper east side (main office) is packed at all hours even 6am on weekends. It sometimes did feel like a factory, but everything was well organized and efficient. I found going for monitoring right when the opened allowed me to very rarely wait any great length of time. My husband did have to wait to give his sample. The staff including the receptionists and medical assistants were also very warm.The clinic offered incredible treatment from start to finish. The facility was clean and organized.  I never waited more than 20 minutes for an appointment and often went right in. I would highly recommend to a new patient. They had a convenient satellite location downtown where I could go for monitoring.  This location was much more efficient than the UES location.  Working with Dr. Davis and his administrators was always easy.  Once you have to come for monitoring, schedule of your procedure, preop, your procedure and recovery you feel more like you’re in a big institution.The clinic was a nightmare at best. I cannot honestly think of any strengths except the wait time was manageable. 

Weaknesses: They are unresponsive. Can never get anyone on the phone. Do not explain anything or assist with insurance. Weill Cornell/CRM has the power of research and cross-collaboration with other departments over time under their belt.  Patients benefit from that, maybe even without knowing it.  Their biggest weakness is size, a lack of personalized care, disorganization and certain staffers who bring down the efficacy of the overall operation, either with their own inefficiency or simply a bad attitude.World class doctors and staff. It's a very busy clinic but efficient - they do a good job with the monitoring process and I never had to wait very long. It's a one stop shop with radiology across the street if you need an HSG and the retrieval/transfers are also done across the street.Cornell has a great reputation.  I've spoken with doctors and embryologists at other clinics who speak highly of Cornell and its labs.  But, Cornell also has a high patient volume.  That means that it seems like a zoo during morning monitoring, and you will rarely see the same nurse/doctor twice.  Getting personal attention is very difficult. The clinic is large, which I think is a strength, because they see so many cases per year and have a vast amount of experience. The downside is that you may feel a bit like you’re in a factory, particularly during monitoring hours. 

The Tribeca office is a great compromise because it has the benefits of the large clinic but is smaller than the main uptown office and feels a bit more personal. Cornell is like a factory - but they are highly successful. You must be super prepared to be a self advocate and follow up on EVERYTHING - from billing, to questions for nurses, to staying on top of your protocol and meds.

The environment leaves much to be desired, with the awkwardness of the waiting rooms [in clinic and in hospital], lack of anonymity, lack of any type of patent coordinator.

i stuck with the practice only because I loved my doctor.

WARRIOR REVIEWI'm repeating myself - I think the strength of a place like Cornell is that you are going to get a lot of individualized attention from your doctor plus a state of the art medical facility. Also the doctors there confer with each other which is great. You really can't go wrong at Cornell.I liked the clinic and waiting area. It was clean and calm. I did not have any monitoring done so I cannot speak to what that experience is like. Everyone was efficient and I felt they were competent, which put me at ease. I really like going to the Mt. Kisco office because it doesn't feel like a factory, in contrast with the UES office. I also really like that I saw Dr. Elias every time I was there, as I know many others who did not have that experience of seeing their specific doctor. My only complaint was that I didn't realize I would have to go to the UES office so much - and the parking there is super expensive, and the drive can be challenging.Impersonal but efficient. If you arrive before 7:30 you won't wait all that long. The hours and location were convenient for me. Monitoring hours are from 7-9am on weekdays. I was able to stop in before starting my work day, and usually in and out within 30 minutes. Diana, the patient coordinator is super knowledgeable and extremely efficient. Vanessa, the nurse who draws your blood, is probably the best at what she does. Whenever a different nurse drew my blood it always hurt. Vanessa was always quick and painless. Cornell is a well oiled machine. Monitoring is from 6:30-8:30am. I usually arrived around 6am as it's first come first serve. By 6:15 there are several women waiting. They run the clinic efficiently but still bring your patience. Beautiful and comfortable state-of-the-art facilities. Tribeca is often a lot more efficient when it comes to bloodwork and ultrasound. Make sure you do your homework and get pre-certified if your insurance requires it. Sometimes you feel like a number during morning monitoring, but in my opinion, it also helps you feel reassured that you're going to a place where lots of others are trusting them with their care. Even if you don't get to see your doc. for monitoring, the other physicians I have also liked are Dr. Schattman, Dr. Kang and Dr. Melnick. Be advised that your physician likely won't do your egg retrieval or transfer as they all rotate OR days so it just depends which day you're ready and you'll get the doctor on-call.The offices at Will Cornell are also superbly up-to-date and clean, which sounds obvious, but is not something I found in other clinics. The waiting room is quiet, clean and efficiently run. The exam rooms are similarly clean and machines look new. Yes - the waiting room is filled with patients. But, the wait times are less than 20 minutes about 90% of the time. Monitoring hours of 6:30-8:30 are convenient and I often showed up at 8:40 with no issues. If your doctor wants you to schedule an appointment, appointments are easy to come by (typically) and rarely did I ever have to wait.Efficient clinic; I am usually seen within 10 minutes of checking in for my appointment

Some patients might feel like it's a revolving door because there are usually several people waiting If you like an anonymous and mechanical office for something this imporant, you'll love it here.  Otherwise, I'd skip it.Strengths: excellent care, patient needs first- felt like decisions and recommendations were based on what was best for me medically and not what would line their pockets or skew their results as other clinics might.
Other strength is I love that all blood test results are same day and I never waited too long there.
Cons: honestly biggest con is cost. It's a fortune. The clinic has an excellent reputation and operates like a well oiled machine. I like this, however, it can feel like a mill.I really like the Tribeca office. It is pretty easy to get an appointment and wait time for walk in blood work is reasonable. I also appreciate that you can go to the UES location on the weekends. For some appointments (IVF prep class, genetic counselor consultation, appointment prior to egg retrieval) you have to go to the UES location which is a little inconvenient for me but for the most part my care has been at Tribeca. Front desk staff is relatively easy to get in touch with and they are responsive via email and phone. The clinic has the system down to a science and operates like a well-oiled machine.  These types of clinics can often make one feel like an animal in their treatment of patients, but I haven't felt that here.  The waiting area is well situated and waiting times for daily monitoring are minimal.   The only problem for me is that it is a pain to get there.  One area for improvement is their billing department.  Last year they double charged me several appointments.  My have colleagues who use this clinic who have said that it has been a nightmare as well working with the billing department. too many patients
too little personal approach
too many different doctors speeding through ultrasounds
not a personal feel 
Billing is the weakness... lots of billing mistakes, endless phone calls. Otherwise, the team is amazing. Strengths: very efficient and able to handle high volumes of patients. Flexible monitoring hours. Highly successful results. 

Weaknesses: some issues with billing/ filing insurance claims/ getting reimbursements. You don't see your primary Dr for most procedures. Retrievals are done at the hospital across the street vs in office, which is an added expense. Cornell is a well respected clinic where the doctors confer on approach and they also have excellent support services (genetics, billing, etc.).  It lacks a personal touch and that waiting room in the morning for monitoring is about the worst place on this Earth but some of it comes with the territory.  It's important to work to establish a relationship with your doctor and his assistant and focus on that and otherwise ensure to advocate for what you need as they are responsive.  The clinic feels like a very large, impersonal operation. However, it has a great reputation for results and the staff is polite. I really appreciate that monitoring hours start at 6:30 and although many people will be waiting by 6:40, the whole things runs very smoothly, you're in and out in no time.Many other patients have described CRM as a well-oiled machine. It is, which, when it comes to IVF, is a great thing. Having experienced both kind of clinics - more personal vs more automatic - I prefer this environment. Everyone is super nice and professional, but the automation keeps things moving smoothly. With this volume of patients, everything has to be timed to the minute. Despite the high volume, the obvious compassion and level of training from everyone - the billing team, receptionists, nurses, doctors - makes you feel like a person.Cornell is a very busy clinic and a wekl oiled macbine. You will not see the same doc for monitoring each morning and your dr will most likely not be doing your proceedures. This is not a clinic for hand holding. However they are the best at what they do. At first it bothered me they were not more progressive, but in the end their way worked for me. The clinic is fine and they have two or 3 locations - none are convenient for me but they may be for others. The set times for monitoring are nice if you need to schedule but the walk in times are also good b/c you can get in early before work. On the weekends you have to go to the main building on the UES and it can be very crowded in there. If you do IVF they will give you a card to swipe in each time which is pre-loaded with your reason for visits - this is nice and prevents you from having to stand in line to check in.The strength is that they have great labs and great doctors. The negatives is that it is a total factory. If you are looking for a lot of hand holding through the process this is NOT the pace for you. If you have a supper system outside of the doctors and just want the best medical care then Cornell is great. The waiting room can be intimidating since it's often packed for morning mornitiring. It's so busy. Monitoring hours are between 6:30 and 8:30 am so the waiting room is usually crowded. The staff is good about getting everyone checked in quickly and the nurses are constantly calling patients in so there is movement in the ""line"", but you just have to wait. The nurses drawing blood are quite skilled so the blood work is usually quick and painless. The system works like clockwork.

The IUI scheduling didn't work out that great for me. They tell you to arrive by 8:30am, which is when the andrology lab opens. From there, if you are using frozen sperm, it is an hour-long thawing process, but it can be a long wait. For one IUI, I didn't actually get into the room for the IUI until after 10:30am (which I did not expect) so I was stressed out. I saw at least two other women in the waiting room who were also complaining about waiting for a long time. I don't know what they were in for, however.

I would recommend that if you have other obligations, try to reschedule those obligations for hours later or another day if you go for an IUI. It takes much more time than they tell you. You will feel like a number. The nurses are mostly wonderful, but you will not often see the same nurse for bloodwork. Befriend and lean on the nurse who calls you with your results. Make friends with your doctor's coordinator, because if you have an issue and can't reach someone on the nurse's line (I've never called and had someone pick up), they will be able to get it sorted and get you through to someone. You're essentially on your own here. Strengths: Caring staff, smaller office, convenient location, easy walk-in process for monitoring appointments. Weaknesses: The billing department for the fertility clinic is terrible. The woman who works there is a nightmare. Can also be difficult to get ahold of the doctor - even when leaving a message, a nurse will call you back and you have to then put through another message that you want to speak to the doctor.  Can be frustrating.The morning monitoring hours (between 7-8:30 I think) can be very crowded. I often have to wait more than 30 minutes even if I'm just doing a blood test that will take 2 minutes. But the overall clinic and staff is great. They're all very competent, organized, and friendly. Expect high volume and the pros and cons that come with it.  

Less personal attention but very efficient.  

The retrieval procedures done through NY Presbyterian were as stress-free as I think they could possibly have been. 
Cornell certainly has a factory feel to it. I felt the front desk was quite rude or dense sometimes; for instance I once was told to come in for a blood draw but wasn't told what time to come in. I called and asked if I could come anytime and specified that I was on my way in as we spoke. When I arrived ten minutes later they told me that they actually close for lunch between 12 and 1pm. Other times I would go in and the front desk would act annoyed by me checking in or tell me that I was at the wrong check-in desk of the two available as if this is something I'm just supposed to know. 

The monitoring hours are early and a narrow window - they were 6:30 to 8:30 am on weekdays when I went here. This wasn't convenient for me personally. 

The worst part about my experience was the poor communication between staff and patients. There was no online portal or email; you had to leave a voicemail for your nurse coordinator and then wait for her to call you back at a random time during the day when you may or may not be available. It was maddening for anyone trying to balance a busy work life with fertility treatments as well as being ineffective. Cornell is like a factory! That did not bother me at all - my focus was on getting RESULTS! In the results department, they are excellent. The doctors and nurses are simply amazing. Don't be overwhelmed or intimidated by the set-up there. Just focus on why you are there and don't be a stress freak - it is not even good for your chances. I did acupuncture for many months also which helped me with the stress reduction during the process.I was generally pleased with Weill Cornell.  They are very efficient given the volume they deal with.  The staff members were always pleasant.  If you want a small clinic, this place is not for you.  I once counted 60+ patients in the waiting room on a Sunday morning.  This said, I was rarely late for work due to morning appointments.  The monitoring process is surprisingly fast.  You will not always see your doctor; your doctor may not do your procedure.  However, I did see Dr. Kang more often than not.  I found Weill Cornell to be easier and more pleasant to deal with than NYU. Cornell has good success rates, skilled physicians, and good labs.
However, the high volume of patients serves as a barrier to quality individual time with your RE. You will see different RE's throughout monitoring, retrieval, and transfer.Cornell has the benefit of some amazing doctors with experience and nursing staff; their hospital New York Presbyterian where we end up visiting for all procedures is well equipped with state of the art technology. All their offices have mostly helpful front staff. Only make sure your insurance has Weil Cornell has in network provider; a lot of times the doctors are part of the insurance, but the practice is not. The billing team doesn't efficiently communicate if your insurance does not accept the practice and then you are left paying some huge bills.Surprisingly, even when waiting room was full, it went quickly. They opened at 6:30am. Sometimes I got there late, ie 9am and it was still possible to do monitoring at that later hour.Monitoring is done early in the morning and you sign in. Everyone is called according to when the signed in. It goes by very quickly, there are a bunch of nurses on staff to help it go quickly and amoothly so you wait at most a half an hour. I believe they have the best Drs. I liked all of them. It was a very busy place in the morning when you are there for bloodwork and sometimes could wait up to an hour, sometimes just 10 min. There's no way to know. Everyone was friendly and compassionate.Strengths: efficiency, cleanliness, reputation, knowledgable, very busy (a lot of experience and knowing you're in good hands)
Weaknesses: very busy, not a lot of personalization/you feel more like a number, wait times for nurse advice in person, limited ability to contact the doctor directlySeveral doctors who meet together to determine e best course of treatment. 

Clean, modern facility.

Very large so tons of patients.Cornell has a lot of patients, so their volume everyday is high. The downside of having monitoring hours only from 6:30-9am means that the wait could be long. I tended to go on the later end of monitoring, closer to 9am, so my time there was about 20-30 minutes. There have been times I've waited close to an hour for monitoring.  The clinic is clean, spacious, and well-run.  If I needed to talk to billing, they would try to accommodate me while I was there.  There is also a genetic counselor in the office.  Cornell also closes down for a couple of weeks, two times a year, June and December.  This is to recalibrate all their equipment.  Cornell has a good reputation, factory-like but well oiled machine. It doesn't bother me if I go to a factory like clinic if my doctor has good communicationI felt confident in their medical knowledge, services, etc. It was very convenient to where I lived and worked and that was a major strength since I spent so much time there, especially very early in the morning before work. A weakness would be so many patients and feeling like a number/assembly line. It's very expensive if you don't have insurance to cover any of the charges.I was impressed with the level of care and professionalism of everyone we worked with at Cornell! The TriBeCa office and Dr. Reichman provided a more personal experience that the UES location, but was closed on weekends and holidays, at which times we'd go to the UES location. Weill Cornell is a very busy place which can be both good and bad. I found walking in and seeing at least 50 other women waiting for monitoring in the morning almost comforting, makes you feel like you are not alone in what can be a very lonely process. That said, you can wait a long time for blood work and monitoring if you do not get there early, my advice would be to get there right away.

I found the receptionists to mostly be friendly and helpful, no major complaints. Clinic is a zoo. No point-person designated from nursing team to your case. No means of contacting your doctor directly. Be prepared to wait 15 minutes sometimes longer, but always be on time...actually early because the building has security that can delay you. Also, request a card to sign in as soon as possible. Dr. Reichman was always sincerely apologetic when he was running behind, but he also accommodated me at my last appointment when I got the time wrong. I never felt inconvenienced, as waiting at a doctors is protocol.Because it's the best, it is a busy practice.  The good news is that every doctor, nurse, and fellow you see in your process is an elite practitioner.  They are all truly excellent. The wait for blood work can be long if you come later in the morning, but again, it's a function of a popular practice. I had trouble with the billing, not on the part of the hospital, but my insurance. Please make sure to ask all the billing and finance questions you need, and take notes during the financial consultation. this is NOT a fault on the part of the clinic, but rather issues that came up with my insurance company. Ask for the names of procedures and CPT codes, etc. The more informed you are, the easier it is to get coverage later.This was our first IVF experience, so we didn't know what to expect and got wrapped up quickly in the chaos of a busy, academic clinic setting. Despite a sterile environment, the staff and Dr. Schlegel were very warm. The Tribeca office of Weill Cornell is small and very efficient.  I was never made to wait more than 20 minutes (and that was an anomaly - even for morning monitoring I was usually called within 10 minutes).  Cornell is an amazing clinic. I have heard they ""take everybody"" - and I think that's why they are very good at what they do, because they take the hardest cases. Their team was very supportive and organized. The see A LOT of patients so that would be the only thing that can be intimidating to someone. But I always felt comfortable there.Una!!!! Maybe her role is ""care coordinator,"" or administrator. She has forms that tell us expected costs (even for procedures we're not currently considering) and how to navigate with insurance companies. She is thoughtful about scheduling, so we get as much as possible out of each visit. And she returns phone calls promptly. She is awesome. It's an efficient clinic, they ""process"" hundreds of patients each morning.  Most staff are friendly and remember you on a personal name basis if you cycle for several months.  Because there are so many patients, it seems the doctors don't recall what you did in prior cycles - sometimes I find myself needing to remind them that I did X and it didn't work so let's try something else.  There seems to be a lack of continuity of care, and that they don't care about whether IUI cycles succeed because they don't report those to the CDC.The Tribeca office is small and it was nice to always see Dr. Reichman for monitoring hours. I never waited very long for monitoring and blood work. I live all the way uptown, but Dr. Reichman felt strongly about being the one to see me and I appreciated that. The waiting room just smells like desperation. Be prepared for that; I was shocked. 

Everything else is great.Tribeca location usually didn't have a long wait if you got there right when it opened.  UES location did always have a long wait, but tons of people were there in the waiting room, so it appeared to be moving as fast as it possibly could.The monitoring staff works quickly to get you in and out each day.  The waiting area is comfortable and spacious enough for everyone to have a seat while waiting.  Truthfully, we cycled at Cornell because we were supposed to time with TESE. That being said, I was there as a tourist, so a busy clinic didn't bother me - I was just along for the ride and it was my first IVF so I didn't know what to expect. I was seen at the Upper East Side clinic, which was very clean, updated, and efficient. Monitoring appointments are performed early in the cycle by fellows in training, which I didn't min. My husband is in his fellowship and I work at a hospital, so I understand the necessity of learning/teaching. Later in the cycle all monitoring will be done by attending physicians - never technicians/nurses. All IVF coordinators were friendly and answered questions by email/phone within a few hours. Despite my recollection of having good communication with the IVF team, we actually had better communication on behalf of the urology staff. Some other patients I met seemed annoyed that they had to come to the Upper Eastside location on weekends for monitoring and procedures if they were otherwise being followed at another office location.
We were paying completely out of pocket; payment was required in full within the first few days of monitoring. Also had to pay in full upfront for saline sonogram, retrieval anesthesia and facility fee since performed in an OR. There were extra embryology fees as well, since we had to use ICSI.The facilities are pretty up to date and not overly cold or clinical.  The waiting room is large, which is in a sense nice because when it's crowded (every morning) you get a sense of how many people are in the infertility journey with you.  I appreciate that the egg retrievals and embryo transfers are done in a sterile OR environment, not in an office, though I was a little sad my husband couldn't be in the OR for the transfer.  The billing staff is courteous and will help you navigate things.  CRM is huge.  I used to describe the waiting room as the United Nations of assisted fertility since people come from all over the world for treatment.  They have exceptional knowledge and expertise, and so there are a lot of patients.  I never really felt like ""just a number"" but it is a bit overwhelming to be in such a large waiting room.  Everything is very clean and professional.  Note:  they do call out your full name in the waiting room, so if you would find that difficult, consider other options.The clinic is amazing. I have only great thinks to talk about it: the structure is great, process, technology used.
The only down side is that due to the amount of patients you can wait for a long time to be monitored It is clean and organized.  It's a pleasant place to be relatively speaking.  Most importantly though it's attached to a research university which I think is a very important aspect of any medical establishment.  This means that the doctors are more informed of their more curious and innovative and they're less fixated on statistics and money than other places. I felt that Weill-Cornell is willing, therefore, to take risks on patients rather than pushing them to look elsewhere or opt for donor eggs.Baby making factory. Efficiency like I've never seen in my life. Clean and nice but I must emphasize the efficiency. Very well oiled machine, managing about 150 women per cycle. Extremely efficient in the morning, almost too efficient in that you don't get much time with the doctors. But it's the only way they could possibly see that many women in one month. The clinic is fine. Some would say 'factory-like' which I suppose is true but it's clean and well-run so that didn't bother me. The big thing to know is that monitoring is NOT done by your doctor unless he/she is working that day. The worse thing is that monitoring is not even done by Attendings until you're at least one week into your stims. Biggest strength is that the were willing to take me and made it all happen and were pleasant and efficient about it.
Biggest weakness was one obnoxious phlebotomist.
I hate the relatively new (done because of HIPAA) practice throughout Cornell of calling people by their first name and last initial when they call out for you in the waiting room as though we were all in kindergarten, but that's not their fault.  I'd prefer they either ask me what I'd like to be called, or just have us all take a number like they do at the deli.Strengths: unbelievably strong medical team & lab. 
Weaknesses: they're a big operation & necessarily run like one. 

(But if you think those compare in weight? That's your problem. Also: I grew up in NY and generally value competence & efficiency over politeness. So I'm happy when institutions I work with agree.)I think a weakness is trying to get someone on the phone... it can be a bit stressful. However, they do call back when they say that they will.
Other than that, I absolutely loved the care that I have received from them thus far.I am a private person, so I
Was sometimes annoyed by the very public systems (shouting my full name to call me into an appointment), but the staff is generally very kind. I have struggled with the call-back systems, but I think that’s par for the course. Busy, busy clinic so often you feel like a number. That said, because they see so many people they have lots of experience and data. Recommend going in early for appointments or walk-in hours to avoid waiting!Going to the tribeca office was such an incredible experience. You get the benefit of being apart of a large research institution, but the intimate feel of a small practice. I knew everyone that worked in the office and everyone was very kind and caring. The best part of this clinic for me is the location downtown.  It is a new facility so is clean, large and has top of the line equipment.  The only weakness is there is not much privacy in the waiting room, if that is something you are concerned about.Our initial assumption was the Weill Cornell would be a huge factory that would not view us as individuals. That could not have been further from the truth. They were always responsive and willing to accomodate our schedule. It's a big clinic with many doctors available.  However, I feel like it's a factory and I am just a number. They don't seem to try out of the box unconventional protocols unless patients suggest.  You have to be on top of your bloodwork results and insurance authorizations.  They don't really help you.monitoring was an organized and well run process and they often would advise me on the best time to come when the wait would be the shortest. But even if i came at a different time the wait was never too long. It worked well with my busy work schedule.Cornell is highly organized and efficient.  I am constantly amazed at how well things are run.  Monitoring hours are convenient to those of us that work and usually move fast.  I had some issues with Billing/insurance but everything was eventually resolved.  Monitoring hours were typically in the early morning which was convenient in terms of doing it before work. The offices were very busy, but fairly organized. Overall, I preferred monitoring appointments at the Tribeca office vs. UES as wait times were less, and the staff there was much nicer.Monitoring can be crowded at the main site, so going to a satellite location during the earlier part of the window is best. The only complaints I have is the door slams and startles me and it is super quiet.i would prefer some light music in the waiting room. Otherwise, it is a pleasant and cleanly office. I am usually in and out for monitoring within 30 minutes and the early morning hours allow me to go prior to my work schedule. Cornell has a great lab, great team and is organized, but you are one of hundreds.  You wait in the morning while they call your name.  You must be proactive.  Great lab. Pricing seems high and billing is invoiced differently compared to my previous clinic. The front desk assistants are horribly unhelpful and I have to say the same for the billing department. I found the approvals team to offer the most assistance and by far were the most pleasant on the admin sideYou do feel like a number in this practice but that did not bother me. I felt they were efficient and organized and I did not need my hand held. One thing I did not love is that even if you are with a specific dr if he is not on call when it is time for a retrieval or transfer another dr in the practice will do it. I had a dr I had never met do my transfer which was alittle unsettling to me. The lab at Cornell is exceptional. That was one of the draws for me to go there in the first place. However, it is a huge institution and morning monitoring in the city is like a giant, awkward cattle call. morning monitoring was always a long wait. if you got there at 7am it was no time.There are top notch resources available, due to the size if the clinic and their affiliations with university and hospital experts. They are very organized, and have great customer service in all areas, including billing. They are very expensive, however. Tribeca office was great- the York Ave office was a painful line.  i think there is a window in June or July where they don't do IVF so it becomes packed with women squeezing in the last IVF before the doctor's and nurses go on vacation, i think...Factory. Things do slip through the cracks—you have to be very on top of it all and advocate for yourself right from the start. Some staff are lovely, others incompetent and/or rude. Some doctors arrogant/have god complex, and you will see them all at some point if you're there for any length of time. One 2014-2015 fellow, dr. Levine, was unbelievably insensitive and clueless. 
All worth it. Great success rates and generally very very professional. See Dr. Goldschlag.  They function like a well oiled machine. But that means that the personal approach is out the window.  Billing department takes their job very seriously and doesn't let bills slide. There's a bill for everything! Wait times are long especially if you arrive after 7am.  But I felt that I was in expert hands throughout the entire experience.The clinic is efficient and as I ended up with a child, I was extremely happy. I do think it tends to be a very sad place. Going in each morning for monitoring, there are desperate lives on display, marriages falling apart, tears being shed. You go through so much and meet a lot of failure along the wayIt was a cattle call - but it was well runCornell is very large so it can be overwhelming coming from a smaller clinic. However, things ran smoothly and I knew I was in good hands. Billing for pretty well explained and handled. Monitoring appointments were before work which made life much easier for me.The clinic is clean and large and easy to navigate. I wish you felt less like a number, but I appreciate going to a place with resources that can accommodate so many families on the journey. 
I enjoyed the tutorial classes but wished they were in smaller groups.
I like the hours as well for monitoring. Since it is a bit of a routine, having the early option was clutch for getting to work on time. etc.Clean, Organized, and Efficient. I have visited a few clinics with my wife and by far this is the most organized and efficient one. They are open and available to meet their clients needs. I also believe it is easily accessible bt public transortation.This is a large hospital, which a large number of doctors and nurses. Coming from Long Island, there are the usual problems of having to go to Manhattan on weekends and for anything beyond monitoring. We have also had some real issues with billing, but no problems with the doctor's services. The Tribeca office is fantastic, the nurses are great, and patients are seen quickly.The office is smaller than uptown so the staff remember your name, which is nice. The downside is to have to go uptown at weekends where there are so many patients it feels like you're just a number.  Very large program, takes time to learn to navigate. Let Shanise help you.
It is a group practice so you will see more than one physician.
They do every thing and have seen everything - great to be cared for by true experts.Same as other clinics, You come in sign in, sit for 1 or 2 hours, longest we waited was almost 4. Then you go back and its in out! Random doctor every time. They are very organized in contacting you after every check up and giving you instructions. They give you good training on the common procedures  and what to expect. However they handle too many people and sometimes it feels not personalized.It is busy!  Go early if you have to go in on the weekends. Overall, very professionally run though there is variability among the doctors and nurses on their compassion. They serve a lot of patients so you may feel like you are part of a conveyor belt experience if you don't have the right doctor to guide you through the experience.  It is a big factory. You certainly do not get personalized care, however they do what they must do. Most of the times the time I have spent there most of the mornings were very quick. Only a few times I had to wait for a long time.The clinic was clean and reasonably sized. I've seen other clinics that were crowded and huge. I appreciated that although this is a big clinic in NYC it had a smaller feel to it. I felt like people remembered me when I came in (the doctor, nurses and front desk) which made the experience better as well. Weill Cornell is a large clinic but the staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. It’s very busy but they run a well oiled machine. They also do a good job of teaching patients how to use the injectable medicines at home. Its a machine. That has positives and negatives. The monitoring staff is generally lovely. Medically it’s great. I think the difference between my first round and the last is that it seems less coordinated between the nurses. The strength is the doctors' level of expertise.Lovely and clean environment. Very comfortable and well organized. Fantastic location. I enjoyed coming. There was never any issue. Simple to access and the staff are lovely. It is a doctors office but they’ve made it as clean and modern as possible. It's very disorganized. There is no one coordinating care, finances and treatment goals. I had to call the practice manager to complain about insurance and personal billing practices. I had two cycles canceled due to disorganization. I don't think the practice is run very well.It is a very popular clinic. Morning monitorings sometimes can take a long time. However they are trying to do at a fast pace. The billing department is not so good. They messed up my billing couple times. Super experienced team of high quality doctors and operates like a well-oiled machine.  Be prepared for it to be busy and that you may not see the same doctor/nurse on daily visits !  I think it is the best clinic in NYC.It’s a large place, but it feels small because the team seems to remember you and your case. Since it is big during egg retrieval you don’t typically see your dr. I do feel like they could be more through w their initial assessments w patients prior to starting ivf. Very knowledgeable team and high technology but a lot waiting time and really “cold”. They seems to see a lot patients, but the treatments I received worked. I didn’t have a great experience overall at the clinic as i was always rushed in and out The clinic is very clean and nicely decorated, if the latter is important to you. The magazine selection is good, too. The hours work with yours, as well. The clinic is easily accessible by public transportation.Inconsistent- sometimes very long waits and sometimes no wait.  Front desk is rude and unhelpful.  The office itself is beautiful and clean.  Appointments tend to run 10-15 minutes late, however, Dr. Reichman was always apologetic if he was running late.  The front desk staff is very friendly, helpful and efficient. Be prepared that sometimes the waiting room is packed during monitoring hours. however they move pretty fast. I've never been in the office a full hour. They get you in and out during those hours (630-830).Strengths - moves very fast!Weakness: Factory Feeling: Daily monitoring took a long time, waiting with 100+ other women, hard to get a hold of staff, etc. Overall a very positive environment - did not feel very hospital like and everyone was very easy to interact with. Would like to have interacted more with our primary doctor but all the attending physicians are some of the best in the world. Wait times could be long if you did not arrive prior to 730am for monitoring. Also, spent too much time with billing.Highly efficient, professional, organized. Appointment times easy, no long waiting. If you live on Long Island you can only be monitored 7-9 in garden city. If u need to be seen on weekends it is in Manhattan. Also all procedures are in Manhattan.I don't think this clinic has weaknesses.  It is efficiently run.  All testing/pgs is done in house. Nether embryology is great.  Sometimes hard to get someone on the phone initially, but once you are assigned a nurse, email communication is great/fast.We liked Weill Cornell's modern facilities. The uptown location gets very busy, and there may be some wait time but not bad.  Dr. Reichman's location in Tribeca was busy but wait time was not so much of an issue.   Likely the best in NYC. This is after being tended to at NYU, Roosevelt. Great doctors but because it's a hospital can feel like a factory at times.They are very early in the morning and you have to give yourself time because it could be a fast process or not so much. The Dr always very nice and respond all our questions.See comments on what patients should know about doctor SpandorferIt was crowded but I never waited more than 20 min. Many days I waited only 5.It's a fertility mill.  You're a number and there was very little, if any, specific, or customized care offered for my specific situation.The weakness ; It feels like it’s a conveyer at times. Too many patients.
 The strength : Nevertheless, the office is clean and the wait time is very reasonable most of the time. The staff is very polite. Strengths: great doctors
Weaknesses: not always warm and fuzzy or transparent in terms of which dr does the retrieval/transfer and what their success rate is. As a patient spending tons of money, I want to have a say in who is actually performing the procedures One of the best in the country. It’s nyc, so people are everywhere (mornings there are crowded). blood is taken in stalls like a farm but it’s all good. You know you are in good hands. I am very happy I chose Cornell. Cornell is pretty well run, most of my appointments runs on schedule. they are pretty  careful when get close to the cycle that i need to monitoring everyday. but overall IVF cost in Cornell is quite expensive.  I was always seen within a reasonable period of time.Relatively efficient if you got there early; otherwise could be a long wait.Organized, streamlined, expensive but worth it for expertise. Minimal wait time. Accommodating to changes in life schedule. Sometimes hard to reach after hours but you eventually reach someone. Nurses and staff are knowledgeable in their competencies. Genetic counselors are skilled but could be more compassionate.Very clean and organized.  The front desk is amazing.  The clinic needs more nurses to discuss the test results, etc. without being rushed.

The clinic downtown near WTC is rightly located and easily accessible.Cornell is a machine.  Very little compassion from the admin side.  you need to be proactive and on top of everything.  with the donor program, you really need to be a squeaky wheel.  make sure you understand your meds and protocol before you start.  World class clinic and lab, but serves many many patients - can feel overwhelming and stressful. Focus on why you are there- and no the crowds.  Come early so you don't wait for hour+ during monitoring.  Long waits, lots of women, cattle call. Very large clinic that sees a lot of patients. But I don't I feel that is a bad thing.   They see a lot of interesting cases therefore they have knowledgeable in all facets of fertility Clinic is huge...meaning billing department doesn't care about eating back to you and nursing staff seems like they are overwhelmedVery organized. There are a lot of patients Very busyMass of women, but orderly.My consultation appointment started 30 minutes late, but I did get a full appointment in. The clinic seems a bit sterile, which I guess is probably appropriate. I was a little bit confused about next steps after leaving but I called the care coordinator and he set me straight so it ended up not being an issue.Exceptionally prompt, lovely atmosphere, perfectly communicative. Everyone was smart and compassionate. It has made every other medical experience pale in comparison to Dr. Pereira's office and team. The clinic itself can feel cold, but the nurse I was assigned to is a blessing. The The mandatory IVF class is extremely helpful and you can ask all the questions you need to while practicing to handle your medications properly.
Cornell is great if you work full time. The monitoring hours are great and they are fully staffed with physicians rotating so you can get treated constantly, which is lacking at many other clinics. The main weakness is they have out grown the UES location already. The waiting room is too crowded and loud so it is difficult to hear when they are calling you. The clinic also lacks that human touch. Strength: organized, efficient, great lab, great doctors and staff
Weaknesses: billing is complicated in general; medical coordination (for pre certification and questions about out of pocket, for example) is not straightforward The office is very nice, clean, and spacious.  I never really found myself waiting too long to be called. Everyone is super friendly and makes you feel comfortable. I have no complaints about anything. I have nothing but great things to say about the clinic. The location is convenient, the office is clean, spacious, and the staff are professional, courteous, and we just had a great overall experience.All was very organized, and clean. All the room very clean, the set up is good. The process and fast and efficient specially taken the blood. Will be great to have a number to call til late  for questions The clinic can feel very busy at times but Cornell is truly the best place you can be. The doctors are the best of the best and all of the treatments are evidence based. The team really cares about outcomes for each patient and they don’t push unnecessary and expensive extras on patients. The nurses are smart caring and will bend over backwards for their patients.
The treatment process was very organized and sophisticated. Inquiries by email was responded accordingly and promptly. there was no issue to have a treatment. But, the billing system sometimes didn’t  work well and we needed to go back and forth such as claim forms and bill statement.It had a parking lot so parking was easy. The doctor was good although I didnt achieve the results I hoped for and when I switched clinics the next doctor was more thorough in a background analysis. I would not recommend Weill Cornell to anyone. They were also affiliated with a hospital in manhattan so my procedure had to be there which was inconvenient It was clean and comfortable and felt like a medical practice. Normal appearance. Very busy clinic. Felt like an airport waiting room. High quality furniture and equipment. Lots of turnover as well. Diverse crowd of patients Cattle call. Ugh. I have nothing but good things to say about Weill Cornell Tribeca. It is a bright, clean, and modern facility and everything feels top of the line. The waiting room is large and comfortable, the reception staff is organized and works quickly, and I never had to wait longer than a few minutes for an appointment. The clinic is very well organized and clean and situated in a very convenient location. Our experience with the billing department was not great and had to constantly follow up with them for our pre-authorizations. During our visits we found lots of patients in the waiting area but not much waiting time and we were attended by the nurses or the doctor soon.The Weill Cornell Tribeca clinic is modern, spotless, efficient, friendly, and filled with a talented team of administrators and medical professionals committed to your long-term success. The clinic can be very crowded during monitoring hours so I would recommend arriving early. This clinic is clean and runs very well.  The front desk staff is efficient, and there is almost never a wait if you have an appointment and typically a short wait for walk in monitoring. The phlebotomists are great and also very efficient.  Overall, I highly recommend the clinic.Very clean, modern, and very little wait time - absolutely perfect. Even the UES location on the weekend mornings which was insanely busy, was well organized, and I never had to wait more than 15 mins. I honestly don't have any complaints about the clinic.My husband and I couldn’t have asked for better medical care and clinic. We did a very thorough research before coming to Cornell, the embryology lab is world class. Every process is very efficient, I was never nervous that something can logistically go wrong, and we did all procedures back to back with no break. Excellent clinic.  They know what they are doing and they have a healthy success rate.  Patient should request early appointments in the day if they have regular lab draws.  The clinic is very flexible in accommodating to patient's daily schedule.I always saw my doctor for monitoring and I never had to wait very long - even if it was crowded. The team is very organized.Cornell's early monitoring hours are really great and and make it really easy to avoid a disruption to work. It was easy to make appointments and get in for super last minute ultrasounds if I was ever feeling nervous about anything. Highly recommend Cornell's fertility care.Despite the hardship in the first failed rounds, it was an overall extremely good experience. The staff were kind (I weirdly miss those kind smiling faces on reception) and it was so well run. Everything was taken care of for us and the team were on call should we have any queries at any time during our treatments. The clinic is very clean.  It is a warm environment.  Patient information is all kept private.  The fact that the team is so organized, helps with waiting times.  You will not sit in the waiting room for 1hr wondering if anyone forgot about you.  They are on point.  Feels like a cattle call some mornings, most mornings are very efficient and painless, overall staff is great--professional, friendly, efficient.
You'll find the people you want to deal with on a regular basis.There was one particular front desk lady that was never all that friendly or happy to be there but apart from her everyone was lovely and welcoming. Wait time was fine and never too long. You always knew what to expect in regards to process and timing. This location is just great.  Brand new and organized.  My only complaint - however slight - is that the front desk check in just wasn't as kind as the medical staff.  But so minor that i could not recommend this clinic more.The clinic staff was always extremely welcoming and lovely. We appreciated every one of them. The weaknesses include billing issues that we are still trying to resolve, months after we have finished treatment. The clinic at Tribeca is great. I never had to wait too long for blood drawing or ultrasound. The space is new and really nice/clean. The front desk staff basically knows your name from the first time you go, which is also great and makes you feel safe. The clinic was very professional and helpful.  It was always easy to set up appointments.   They were always punctual and diligent. Everyone at the clinic treats you with the utmost compassion and makes you feel like a person and  not a number.  I loved the location, cleanliness, front desk staff and Amanda! At times it felt like a cattle call but that's to be expected at a fertility clinic in NYC.  I looked forward to my appointments even when they were very early in the morning. I did not like that there wasn't weekend monitoring at the downtown location. Convenience, efficiency, great for working moms-to-be, completely transparent, professional, clean, knowledgeable.  Weill Cornell was recommended to me by a friend and I am so glad that I went there.  From day one I was sure that we would be successful with Dr. Pereira New, clean, well run and organized. It gets very busy but I don't think they can be blamed for that, I think it's amazing that the doctors and staff work so hard to help so many as quickly as possible.We loved the facilities, very clean and modern. I would definitely recommend the location in Tribeca and Upper East to a friend. 
Also, the hospitals where they perform the surgeries were very high end. Cycles monitoring and blood work were scheduled and available everyday from 6:30-8:30 amThe front desk staff were not always the most friendly, but I know they were checking in hundreds of women every morning. Everything else was always very smooth. Aside from a few times when I had a long wait, usually I was able to see the doctor within 5-10 minutes and appointments were very quick. Only great things to say. They were always accommodating with appointments, minimal wait time and it was a new and clean office.  The staff was friendly and knew their patients.  They always called within the same day with results and follow up information.  Transparent in their policies; communicative; very responsive to questions, calls, and requests; easy to schedule; nice staff. If I had to say a weakness, sometimes I had to wait for bloodwork. My doctor was always on time though. Very well organized, which was always surprising to me given how busy the waiting room could get. If you arrive early enough you don't have to wait. However, there were days I rolled out of bed on the later side and still never waited more than 20 minutes.If you are willing to be at the office right at 6:30, there is almost no wait time. I made it my priority to always be in by 7am, and never had an issue being late to work.Weill Cornell's monitoring hours was from 6:30 am-8 am so it was convenient for me. I will still be late for work since I start 7 am but I will just have to come to the clinic at 6:30 or earlier. It is a well oiled machined will lots of people taking blood so we move quickly. Dr. Schattman will also try to see me during monitoring hours for the ultrasounds which I liked since it also gives me opportunity to ask him questions. Most times the wait is over an hour, though recently it has been under 15 minutes. Basically very variable.It was a cattle call with a line around the corner. I regularly waited at least an hour, and once was forgotten in an examining room waiting for an ultrasound.Monitoring appointments were very efficient. You have a window of time they do ""morning monitoring"" and you don't have to wait very long once you arrive. Once you are pregnant, the 2-3 ultrasounds you have to have are via appointment after monitoring hours.In the Tribeca office it is a very pleasant experience even when crowded -- and it's never that bad. I don't think I have waited longer than 30 min to be seen and sometimes i get seen within 10 min.The clinic has the flow down for monitoring appointments and is run efficiently however, there can be long waits due to the number of patients if you decide to go at ""peak time"".  It is best to go when monitoring hours open or if it works for you, to their Tribeca office.100% a cattle call. See above. I walked in one saturday and there were literally 75- 100 people waiting to be seen. It is the worst model for monitoring. Often times lots of people waiting during morning monitoring hours. Generally didn’t wait more than 20-30 minutes. One side of waiting room is for scheduled doctor appts, other side is for monitoring. I liked that the monitoring hours was daily. Some clinics close on Sunday but this clinic is open Monday-Sunday. It can get busy at their Upper East Side Location, but if you don’t want to wait, then you can arrive early and avoid any wait time.Monitoring appointments were extremely efficient - as long as you got there before 8 AM you would be in and out within 15 minutes. I hear if you go past 8 AM it can be a bit of a longer wait, so I definitely recommend getting there early. During the week I always went to the Tribeca office to see Dr. Reichman for monitoring, so he could be the one performing my ultrasounds and looking at my endometrial lining. 
On the weekends, I went to the Upper East Side office. Although busier, I never waited more than 10 minutes for blood work and ultraound.monitoring always takes about 30-45 minutes, but it was efficient and predicable.  The Tribeca office is very efficient. We rarely had to wait very long. Blood work was very efficient as well. I liked the way Monitoring worked.  Tribeca office is so easy ( if you live downtown). It's a nice, quiet office building. Fewer patients compared to UES and the wait it not long. Including my 10 minute commute to office, I could leave my apt, go to monitoring and be home in 50min-1hr. 
I went to UES on weekend and it was busier and the wait was longer, plus it had the ""hospital"" feel, but I loved the Phlebotomists on UES. Monitoring hours was a well-run cattle call although sometimes waiting for an ultrasound could take a while.Monitoring hours ran like a well-oiled machine. I also got to see Dr Pereira for every single ultrasound monitoring (except a couple occasions when he was out of town) instead of being bounced around to different doctors every day, which was nice for continuity purposes.Morning monitoring starts at 6:30am, however you can arrive prior to that to sign in, which is helpful if it's important for you to be in and out quickly. The waiting room is spacious and has plenty of chairs.  Generally for AM bloodwork and US I am there for ~45min. Monitoring was extremely efficient! I would arrive when the office opened at 6:30am and I would consistently be out and on my way to work by 6:45am even with both blood-work and ultrasound!Some days were very busy and four of us would be called at a time and placed into rooms one by one. Other times, it was not that busy and one 1 or 2 would be called at a time. Sometimes you do bloodwork first, sometimes ultrasound first. There is a window from 6:30-8:30 am to get the monitoring done, so you show up and check in with the front desk sometime between those hours. cattle call but efficient. I found that getting there early was always best (and the nurses tipped me off to this), so waiting wasn't too much of an issue. The clinic was well-run, super organized and had an overall welcoming environment. Already stated above, but the Mt. Kisco office would get crowded during monitoring appointments, but it was more of a personal feel getting to see Dr. Elias (being able to ask your own DR questions).  NYC office was always packed, but they always moved pretty quick.Cornell is a well oiled machine. They are efficient and organized. However, they are extremely busy so a wait time is expected. I was there over a Monday holiday weekend, and my wait times exceeded 1 hour and there were no chairs left.
The monitoring appointments were mostly organized, except for the very long waiting process (sometimes 1 1/2 hours).  The monitoring hours were a little early, but I understand why they needed to be, so that they can have your blood work results back by that afternoon. It was convenient. Hours start at 6:45 and end at 8:30 so it did not interrupt my work schedule.  The earlier the arrival, the less I had to wait. There were often many people there (especially on the weekend, where we had to go to the main central location), which again makes me feel like a number. Monitoring hours are in the early morning and I would make sure to arrive pretty close to when they opened. A typical wait for me was 10-15 minutes tops, they work quite efficiently there.It is well oiled machine.  
Quite organized. Sometimes it's really crowded and you have to wait a little but it's really not that long. Doctors are very professional during ultrasound and nurses very caring for bloodworks. I typically was one of the first people to monitoring in Tribeca and it was quite an efficient operation. I also always saw Dr. Reichman there. The weekends/holidays at the Upper East side could feel a bit more overwhelming but were still organized. It gets pretty busy just before monitoring hours end so I would recommend showing up on the early side.  You won't need to wait very long at all.I made sure to arrive no later then 7:30AM as typically the closer you got to 8AM the longer the wait times. If I arrived by 7:30AM I was able to have my ultra sound and blood work to make it back up to midtown by 8:30AM. For IUIs I would have to make an appointment. There was sometimes a wait but never too long. For IVF it was during monitoring hours, and the wait time was very variable. Sometimes the appointments available were a little earlier or later than I would have liked but it was never too difficult. The upper east side location, where I'd have to go on weekends, was more crowded and had more of a feeling of a huge line.It was a combination of efficiency and a ton of women just waiting. Some days you would have a scheduled time, other was “just come between 7-830”. Weekend at the uptown office were always packed. Earlier the better! The clinic has a good system for monitoring appointments where patients checked in for the appointments in the morning 7 days a week.  I had to get used to in the beginning but soon it became a routine.  Monitoring in Westchester is pretty quick, as it’s a small satellite office. Monitoring in NYC also is generally pretty quick, as they have a large nursing staff. There are a lot more patients in the main NYC office, but the waiting area is comfortable. Monitoring is very early (6:30-8:30 in the city and 7:30-9 in Westchester). The wait time wasn’t exaggerated but it is a different doctor each time.Cattle call on UES, but very efficiently run if you weren’t at the start of your cycle.  Tribeca civilized and well run, never waited there more than 20 minutes. It was pretty well oiled, I think. Fairly efficient, but impersonal when the monitoring MD is not your own.What I do now is schedule an actual appointment, show up then and get seen within 15 minutes of that appointment. 

At the same time and what I used to do was show up anywhere from 6:30 to 9 am and sign in and wait in the waiting room to first get called for bloodwork and then ultrasound. The MD you see for the scan can be any of the doctors in the practice. Their system is automated, so there is a computer system that tells the tech who the next patient they are taking for blood or ultrasound is and what room to put them in. This keeps things moving assuming patients are not missing in the bathroom or grabbing coffee outside at the cart on the sidewalk. Sometimes there can be close to 100 patients waiting to be seen though, which can make the wait take several hours. Monitoring at Tribecca was a well-oiled machine - I was always in and out in less than 30 minutes and often less than 15. On the UES (weekends), it felt a bit more like a cattle call - so many people in the waiting room and often long waits.Not a cattle call. It was a well-oiled machine.  You walk in, sign in, and then sit down until they call you back. Honestly, I was almost always out of there within 20 minutes. The only time I wasn't was when my veins were not cooperating and it would take a couple people to find a vein. Timing was convenient - early morning before work. Wait times were not an issue. Equally, I called once to say I was running late due to a subway breakdown and they calmly assured me I would be seen no problem when I would get there. If I had too many questions for a morning monitoring appointment, Dr. Reichman would arrange to see my husband and I later that day. NYC Upoer east side was a cattle call - I only went there on weekends and would sometimes have to wait 2 hours With every seat taken in their extremely large waiting room. Mt Kisco Office was much better, much more personable with sometimes no wait, and never more than 45 Min wait. The monitoring hours were in the mornings.  I went in and then headed to work.  They were efficient and I never waited very long to be seen or to have blood taken.  They have a nice waiting room and very friendly front desk staff.Very efficient and smoothAlways go between 6:30-7:30am to avoid waiting and crowds.  Front desk demeanor at the Tribeca location was always very pleasant.  Tribeca office a much nicer experience than UES office. A well oiled machine. At the Tribeca office, I usually arrived between 7:45am and 8:10am and I never waited more than 15 minutes. Usually it was 5 minutes or less. At the York Ave. office, I usually arrived around 7 to 7:30 and the wait was also minimal. I learned my lesson that if you arrive after 8am at York Ave. you may need to wait a long time.There was a set time for monitoring and bloodwork.  You learn quickly what times to go in and to avoid due to ""morning traffic"".  It was fine and the timing was ok that I got to work on time.  Busy but efficient at 1305 York ave officeIt was a cattle call and sometimes chaotic. I feel like there has to be a way to automate this more. Operational strategy wasn't superb.I often tried to get there early to avoid the ""crowd"" if I got there before 7:30am I usually did not have a long wait. If I went in later sometimes I would have to wait longer. Easy 
Some days you waited longer than others but dr Elias and team always did their best to keep it moving. I felt like it was a well oiled machine, I chose to go early and never really had to wait more that 15-20min at the most.It can be busy, but it was organized. The Tribeca office isn't as crazy as was UES office. On weekends, I would recommend going right at 630am to the UES (since Tribeca is closed) so you can be in and out. Otherwise, given the amount of women being monitored, you can be there for hours. Tribeca was always quick, organized, and efficient.Morning monitoring takes a long time. I would get there sometimes 45 minutes prior to opening (6:30) so that I could be first and make it to work by 7:30. If you arrive after 6:30 AM, you might be there for an hour. Always had huge lines but most of the time pretty efficient unless you neeed yo speak with a nurse- like at the beginning of the cycle and then can spent hours waiting :((The monitoring hours are very efficient, although the later you come, the longer you will wait-- so if you wanted to be seen quickly, it required that you come earlier.  Even during peak times, the longest I was in the clinic during monitoring was probably half an hour.Monitoring hours are very busy, come early or else at 9am you could have a decent wait. I always went right at opening so I did not have to wait. I needed to be there early to make it to work on time. The line was very long on weekends and later in the morning, this was not an issue for me though because I was there at the earliest possible minute.The UES location was very busy in the mornings and on weekends.  The Tribeca location ran very well and efficiently.It's a zoo, but it is well run.It was an efficiently run window, but there are a lot of women. I tended to go early (like 6:30am) to avoid the 8:30 glut where waits tend to be longer. If I was going in for monitoring at Mt. Kisco, I would get there about 30-45 minutes before they opened so that I could swipe in as early as possible. I work at a school and I'm supposed to be in at 8:15, so I needed to go in early; however, on a day when I didn't have to work I went in later and the wait was not bad at all. So if I had more flexibility, I wouldn't have to have gotten there so early. The monitoring on the UES felt much more ""factory-like"", however, I never had to wait all that long there either.I would describe monitoring hours like a well-oiled machine. There was only one instance when there was a line for check-in, and the office should better explain how to use the kiosk to check in without cards. Once you are checked in, however, you don't wait more than 15 mins to get blood drawn and another 15 before your U/S.I arrive 30 minutes before monitoring opened. There was always a line but arriving early I was usually finished within 30 minutes of clinic opening. Pretty painless at Tribeca office. Usually in and out in 30 mins. There was one day I waited over an hour for bloodwork, but I think this was due to a snowstorm that had impacted morning monitoring the day prior.All monitoring is 630-830 am and I was told the afternoon before whether to come in next day so that's a pain schedule wise but they tell you that in advance. But you're not waiting long. It can feel impersonal because it's a well oiled machine with so many women but they manage it very professionally cattle call but well oiled in getting people in and out. they are good at speed; bad at bedside. over worked. Come early.... It's a well-oiled machine.  The earlier you get there the less wait there is.  It's extremely organized. Monitoring appointments are very busy and the waiting room is full most days. The waiting is the worst, and some days it can be up to an hour.  This is the number one thing I would change about the experience and wish it could feel less like a cattle call.  Super efficient. I do not live close to the clinic in Manhattan (I am about 2 hours away) so it was a pain sometimes getting there in the morning before 8:30. However, I never had to wait long to see someone (less than 15 minutes) and was always in and out. Everyone super nice and professional. Usually there are between 75-100 people waiting. The Mount Kisco location is closer to my house, but unfortunately not as efficient. I think they only have 1-2 nurses there, and usually only 5-10 people waiting, but much longer wait times (usually 30 minutes or more).Busy cattle call. Takes an hour sometimes. Monitoring was from 6:30-8:30am 7 days a week. The waits could be like 1/2 hour but I did notice that once I switched from IUI to IVF the did move me along faster in the morning. They are efficient and quick it's just very high volume of women. Monitoring takes place between 7-8:30am. If you come at 7am, you'll be in and out in 20 minutes. If you come at 8:15, you'll be there for 2 hours. For the most part, it's an efficient system at the Tribeca office. There were some mornings when it would take a long time, but there was always a reason - they were short-staffed or the computers had gone down. If I had an appointment (which I recommend, even for monitoring hours), I was always seen quickly with no issues.I went out of my way to get there very early in the morning to minimize wait time to 20-3min.  Otherwise waits were anywhere from 30min to 2hrs.  Going to the satellite clinic in Tribeca was extremely helpful as it was closer to me and less crowded.There were always tons of people in the waiting room.  However, monitoring was a very efficient process.Yes, it is a cattle call with hundreds of women waiting for blood draws and ultrasound. There were a handful of times I waited an hour to get my blood drawn. Once I waited over an hour and had to leave to get to work. I did not have blood drawn or tested that day and no one seemed to noticed I missed it.I could go in for monitoring in the mornings. The process was efficient. All I had to do was check in at the front office, and I would be called within 10 minutes. Cornell had also issued a card, which we could swipe to check in, and that was super easy. it was a very busy room however they moved it along pretty quickly. Some morning you wait an hour some just 10 min, no way to tell so you have to come prepared with patience. You can go anytime between the monitoring hours. The later you go, the more people are in line ahead of you, and the longer it takes to get out. If I went as early as possible it would be about 30 minutes. But I had to take a train an hour each way so they were very early mornings, and I still got to work late.Tons of patients, however, wait time was not too long.monitoring hours were from 6:30am - 9am. I had flexibility with my schedule so that allowed me to go later.  the wait was about 20-30 minutes usually, with busy days up to an hour.  i would prefer more flexible hours.  the volume of patients here is so high that there are women waiting in line as early as 6am.  The nurses call out your name when it's your turn, but the waiting area is so big, sometimes you can't hear them. And sometimes I was afraid to use the restroom in fear that I'd miss them calling my name. Get there early to avoid long waitsThere were set hours every morning that you would show up, first come first served so some days took longer than others. You'd sit in a large waiting area that was most of the time full, sometimes with limited seating. It was convenient because the hours were so early before I had to be at work.Monitoring at Cornell is very busy. If you get there right when it opens you can usually be in and out in 20 minutes. If you get there towards the end you can wait for upwards of an hour. That said, they are upfront about this and encourage people to get there early. Once you are seen everything runs smoothly. Monitoring appointments were rather efficient. I have never been in the office for more than 45 minutes, including appointment time, despite the occasional heavy crowd. No matter how high the volume of people is, the staff is always polite; as soon as they call your name, you are greeted with ""How are you?"" or ""Nice to see you again."" Monitoring hours were never painful. I live all the way uptown and couldn't be late to school, so I wold make sure to get there early. I was usually in and out quickly and at work on time after each visit. I also always saw Dr. Reichman at my appointments, which helped ease my anxiety and feel confident that he was giving me the best treatment possible. I had traveled for this cycle, so I was at the will of the clinic regardless of wait times. I would typically check in early and be done by 9 am. there were always a ton of women in the waiting room and all seemed to move pretty quickly. IVF monitoring hours are ""monitoring hours.""  TI or IUI monitoring hours are (with the exception of weekends) all with your dedicated RE, and specifically scheduled.  It is a very large waiting room and they call out names every 30 seconds or so.  Get there early and your wait is usually less than getting there in the middle of the monitoring hours.  Getting there on the later end of the window could also work sometimes.  The waiting is comfortable, though most people are understandably pretty stressed out.The clinic monitors their patients early in the morning. Due to the number of patients the waiting time can be very long depending on the time you arrive - the earlier the shorter waiting time  It was an efficient well oiled machine .  One thing I noticed it was different from the other clinic I attended is that they would call you up for monitoring by first and last name.  The other clinic would just use first names presumably for anonymity.  I found that kind of stupid because of course you could see the person, so if you know them you know that they're there for infertility.  But I also found the use of first names only at the other office in the monitoring hours to be subtly infantilizing.  It did mean at Cornell that I noticed a colleague was there and I might not of noticed that she was there if she hadn't been called up to the desk by first and last name.  But I didn't think this was a big deal since obviously were all in the same situation so it's not like I'm going to go gossiping to our mutual colleagues that she was at my infertility clinic, thus outing myself as a fellow infertile.I was working full time, so I went as early as possible. I was always one of the first 10 there so I was seen very quickly and had no trouble making it into work on time.Both a cattle call but well oiled machine. They have timers outside each door and they set it for 7 minutes.Mixed bag. Some doctors were great. And a few (like Kligman) just literally monitored you like a body with a uterus. Cattle call, but comfortable. Much more efficient than time slot appointments would have been. There were definitely a lot of patients during monitoring hours... but I understand. We're all there for the same purpose. There were often a lot of people there, but I was seen in a logical “first come, first serve” fashion. See above. Busy! But much shorter line with early hours. It was a cattle call and umpersonable.  Often you would wait for over an hour.   However after a few rounds I knew certain nurses who would help rush me through if I was in a rush.  There was a time window for monitoring. You would then be called in the order in which you checked in. At the Westchester office, it was pretty straight forward. There were monitoring hours and you would wait in a first come first basis. It was never very busy. This is definitely not the same for the main office in NYC.it was morning monitoring. if you got there early it wasnt a long wait. if you got there after 8am it was longer... It was very convenient, especially because you could go in for monitoring at their downtown location or their uptown locations. Very rushed. Sometimes long waits. Just took a very very long time and felt like I was a number to them. One in a million. Very efficient and I got to see my doctor nearly every day at this clinic. well oiled machine
give yourself a hour to get in and out for the visit / sono / blood workPerfect not long waits, however be aware you will mostly be monitored by different doctorsSome days were busier than other but generally very organized with friendly staff.Monitoring is OK. It is a huge practice so you could wait for a while unless you go very early or vet late.Overall the monitoring is efficient. Some nurses had a hard time to draw the blood due to my small veins.  Sometimes lots of people were waiting during the monitoring hours. Sometimes a long wait but sometimes not. Definitely felt like a factory. Super efficient. Was in and out in 30 minutes. Had blood work and ultrasound, one quickly after the other. The garden city office was great and I was always seen quickly.Monitoring is very efficient.  You come sign in during the window.  They call you by when you signed in.  You are in and out very quickly.Reasonable wait time pretty well run and most of my monitoring are pretty smooth and on time. Excellent, well-oiled machineit is a cattle call.  Sometimes 10 minutes and othertimes 2 hours.  Very organizedThis clinic is too lenient with monitoring and it's a disaster with that many patients.  I would stop walk in since everyone waits for the last possible moment and start using appointments (or the illusion of appointments). Monitoring is empty til 7:30 then gets overcrowded. It was very busy, but they were fast. One would need to learn busier times to avoid wait, but for the most part it was very efficient. They were also ok to bring my older child if needed (which I know is not allowed in some clinics) - I avoided in respect to others, but I did have to take my child sometimes.The Weill Cornell Tribeca office is a an efficient, well-oiled machine. As a result, they are in demand and have a large clientele. Monitoring hours can get busy. They move through patients efficiently, but the earlier you go, the quicker you'll be done and out the door. I was going to downtown location around 8am and the wait was sometimes long, but I didn’t mind. If you are not able to wait, highly recommending to go before 7am, as there is almost no one there. The uptown location on a weekend is a different story, it is super crowded, I tried to go at opening bell. When Dr. Reichman was doing the monitoring or retrievals on a weekend, he would tell me at what time to go uptown to make sure I meet him. While the office was generally super busy during monitoring hours and the wait could be longer than ideal, it was all managed quite well and the actual monitoring was really quick.If we needed to see Dr Pereira immediately without an existing appointment he would schedule us within monitoring hours in order to accommodate us - which was so appreciated. Sometimes there would be a wait, but we found Dr Pereira very punctual - the wait was more for the blood tests.Monitoring appts, as well as most other appts. are all done first thing in the morning.  Monitoring is very frequent.  It is very convenient for the working woman.  You can get all your monitoring done and report to work without a problem. Mostly efficient and convenient to my schedule (6:45-8:30 am). There were a few (mostly rare) occasions when it felt like a cattle call, long-ish wait, then rushed.We never had to wait more than 10-15 minutes at the Tribeca office. The monitoring hours were very convenient for our work scheduleoverall great. ultrasounds were relatively painless and happened quickly (as opposed to some other places I went..)See previous comment",8.800000000000027,8.40000000000005,"Very much like a factory - tons of people in waiting room. I had previously been at RMA and RMA had someone who helped with financial coordination a bit more, but Weill has that as well, however they have you call your insurance and confirm everything personally which took some time. There was one lady who made fun of me for going to the clinic as I was told I should by dr G. for my trigger injection. This is the best clinic and best experience for me. I also felt like the wait times were much less at Tribeca, I don't think I ever went more than 10-15 minutes past my appointment time before being taken back. The nursing staff at the Tribeca office is warm and caring. They were personable even though they see tons of women each day!The office is very welcoming and informative. On weekends and holidays, I had to travel to the upper east side of Manhattan to be seen in the main hospital. And I can imagine you might be surprised by the amount of people in the waiting room, but they have a great system in place and you never have to wait too long. The clinic is very organized and provides all necessary information. sometimes the waiting room is so full that there aren't available seats!They were more like educators and coordinators. When I went for the ""teach"" class where they show you how to inject yourself with Gonal-F and HCG, the nurses were spot on when I said I was a single mother by choice and immediately tailored how to inject HCG to me--injecting in the front of my thigh (as opposed to the tush) and writing a prescription for a shorter needleCornell has a great reputation - but all the doctors are not created equal. I had to advocate for myself and make sure the direction was proper. But they were so organized and I never felt I had to wait too long even though there were hundred of woman there The nurse always returns your phone call and is thorough and clear and doesn’t rush you off the phone. Overall, I would say the clinic was very organized, clean, and as nice of an environment as you could expect for a medical fertility clinic. You will always see your doctor for checkups. They are friendly and take their time with you. The clinic is very well-run and organized. The office and equipment are fairly new and in great condition. Go to Cornell for their lab - we got much better fertilization rate;  They have a lot of patients cycle through so it's not as personal as a private clinic. Wait times can be up to an hour but for the most part were very quick and I felt the clinic did all possible to mitigate waiting. The staff is friendly and knows your name. I didn't feel like my IVF cycle would get messed up because of human error given how often they do them. The front desk team is lovely, energetic and kind. The wait is very long between arrival and the procedure and they mislead you on how long the wait will be. Egg retrievals and transfers are done by the doc on-call that day. We have rarely sat at the reception not knowing when our turn will come, overall a great experience right from Dr. Reichman to Hannah to Amanda and othersBeing one of the best clinics, it's also one of the busiest. When Dr. Melnick wasn't available, I knew I was in good hands with the rest of the Cornell doctors and staff. Over course of my treatment I really got to know some of the nurses and phlebotomists as well as attending and learned that if you request a certain doctor or attending- most of the time they will see you for your scans and that way there is a feel of some continuity through the treatment. Weill Cornell is well organized ""factory"" for IVF-- this didn't bother me much because most of the tip clinics in NYC are this way, and the quality of the lab/embryologist and doctors is what you are going there for. Yes - the waiting room is filled with patients. Other strength is I love that all blood test results are same day and I never waited too long there. There seems to be a lack of continuity of care, and that they don't care about whether IUI cycles succeed because they don't report those to the CDC.The Tribeca office is small and it was nice to always see Dr. Reichman for monitoring hours. I think it is the best clinic in NYC.It’s a large place, but it feels small because the team seems to remember you and your case. As a patient spending tons of money, I want to have a say in who is actually performing the procedures One of the best in the country. I have nothing but great things to say about the clinic. I did not like that there wasn't weekend monitoring at the downtown location. Very efficient and I got to see my doctor nearly every day at this clinic. Monitoring is empty til 7:30 then gets overcrowded."
32,Weill Cornell Medical College,protocol,"I had two unsuccessful IUIs before moving on to IVF.  My first retrieval resulted in 26 eggs that became 13 embryos.  Due to my age and good test results Dr. Spandorfer did not recommend PGS testing.  We did one fresh transfer which resulted in a miscarriage and then 3 frozen transfers before getting pregnant.  Each time we did natural FET cycles.  

I'm now trying for my second and after doing 2 natural FET cycles from frozen embryos from my 1st cycle, I did another retrieval that yielded 31 eggs and resulted in 17 embryos.  This time we did PGS testing and have 7 high quality embryos. We have transferred 4 of those in 3 different FETs, 2 natural and 1 medicated cycle and have yet to be successful.  For IUIs I was on lextrozole + trigger shot, and then letrozole+menopur+trigger. For IVF it was a combination of menopur and Gonal-F. She had me take 100 mgs of clomid on cycle days 4-8, trigger shot on day 12 and IUI on day 13. I will take progesterone suppositories day 17 until negative pregnancy test (or continue on progesterone if pregnant.) Currently waiting for the results.  Fresh cycle: Antagonist protocol with follistim and menopur, followed by ganirelix as trigger date approached. Stimmed for approximately 10 days. Resulted in 14 eggs retrieved, 11 mature, 11 fertilized with ICSI, 1 blastocyst transferred on day 5. Resulted in positive pregnancy test but subsequent 1st trimester miscarriage. 
Frozen cycle: Programmed (due to luteal phase defect/low progesterone in monitoring cycle). Birth control for 3 weeks to begin, layering in lupron injections and estrogen patches, followed by Progesterone in Oil injections. Currently 5 months pregnant from this cycle. My issue was diminished ovarian reserve and being a non responder to the treatment. So we kept trying ... when I didn’t  produce more than 1-2
Follicles, he said that he’d be willing to go for single egg retrieval. We kept
On going and eventually Went for 2 follicle retrieval, and I hadtwo 3-day embryos
Transferred
But it didn’t take, possibly because I had to get treated for a severe yeast infection during that cycle, after the embryo transfer. We kept on going, had endometrial co-culture and eventually got to 3 follicles, 3 embryos transferred, and a singleton pregnancy.  We did clomid and iui for 3 cycles and planned to do gonal-f injections if those cycles didn’t work. They didn’t so we did one cycle of the injections and got pregnant, we heard a heartbeat but then at 8 weeks it was gone. We ended up doing a d&c. We decided to go straight to IVF after that being our 3rd loss.I was diagnosed with low progesterone. I was prescribed a low dose of progesterone. On my first cycle taking the progesterone I became  pregnant. I called his office to arrange a good test. They called me back the next day. After I did the blood (3 days after initial positive result), they congratulated me on being pregnant but told me that my progesterone was low and that I should have been on a higher dose and to start taking more. I already knew it was too late at this point. I told the nurse I thought the HCG levels were too low and she told me to wait another 5 days. I bled 4 days later-without any contact from Dr. Kligmann at any stage of the process. I was also taking a prescription medication at the time related to an autoimmune disorder that he assured me was have to use during the trying to convince period. I have since found out that this drug has been shown (by a number of publications in reputable journals using large study groups) that this medication increases your risk of spontaneous miscarriage significantly. I was never made aware of this by Dr. Kligmann. 5 IUI with one chemical pregnancy IVF: Excellent results with gonal f / menopur stim cycle. FET with estrogen patches and PIO which resulted in an 8 week miscarriage So, the one thing I was not wild about: we ended up with 2 embryos and this was our first IVF. We debated transferring them both, because we were not sure we would go through it all again. But, we really didn't want twins. Dr. Spandorfer told me that at my age (40) the likelihood of twins was very low. Yada, yada, yada, I  have 4.5 month old boy girl twins. Of course I love them and are thrilled, but it was a lot to take in and on.Fsh + AntagonistWe did a few cycles of clomid followed by two IUI'sHe proposed IUI not because we needed it but to increase chances of a positive pregnancy test. He offered IVF as an option, not because I couldn’t get pregnant naturally but so that we could test the embryos to avoid additional miscarriages. He was extremely thorough and well thought out in his plans for treatment. High dosages of medication while stimming, aware of changes in mood, communicated all with doctor and clinic. We were all on the same page as far as protocol. I did well with Lupron flare protocol.I did several IUIs and Clomid cycles. However, I ultimately underwent surgery to treat my endometriosis and a timed, unmedicated IUI that led to success. He did recommend surgery from the beginning, but I was first reluctant. He never pushed it, which I was thankful for, though I probably should have listened to him sooner. I started the cycle with 100mg of Clomid for 5 days. On day 4 I added 150iu Gonal and 150iu Menopur. Menopur was increased to 225iu after a few days (this was my request cause i felt i wasn’t responding well enough). The last 5 days before the retrieval I added Cetrotide.
Since I had a failed transfer at another clinic with a PGS normal 6AA embryo, dr P suggested a fresh transfer for me. He explained that sometimes it’s better to do a day 3 transfer cause some embryos don’t like the lab and there’s a chance that my embryo was rejected by my immune system so an “untouched” embryo may be better for me.  We weren't getting the cycles and blood work back correctly as high as we wanted so he kept changing the drugs until they were perfect. He did not want to waste 2 AA embryos!Since I am fairly young, had gotten pregnant once before, and testing showed no concerns with my health or my husband's, we started with timed intercourse then moved on to try two IUIs. We attempted a third IUI with Clomid but canceled once Dr Reichman saw I was ovulating on my left side where my fallopian tube had been removed. I ended up getting pregnant naturally but it resulted in another miscarriage, after which we finally took Dr Reichman's advice and turned to IVF. He was confident that my recurring losses were due to genetically abnormal embryos so he recommended PGS testing, which was the best call - we should have listened sooner. For my retreival we used Gonal-F, Menepur and Ganirelix and I was monitored very closely throughout the whole cycle. Dr Reichman got us great results, but unfortunately after PGS we had high attrition and were left with only 2 normal embryos. He recommended we move forward with another retrieval which wasn't what we planned, but we talked it through and he felt it would serve us better in the long run to start with more embryos so we could alleviate some pressure, and he was right. We got amazing results from my second retreival (same protocol) and we were able to move forward with a transfer soon after (natrual cycle with a frozen day 5 embryo), which was successful.We did 2 retrievals and one (successful!) frozen embryo transfer. The drugs we used were Gonal F, Ganirilex, and Menopur. We did PGS testing on our embryos. 
These were the same drugs that I used at a previous clinic with two other Drs, but Dr Reichman seemed more up to date than the other Drs were with various testing methods, clinical trials, etc. The treatment with Dr Reichman felt more cutting edge. He is very informed, he listens to your goals and puts together a great state-of-the-art plan just for you. 
We dove straight into IVF due to my diminished ovarian reserve. Dr. Reichman had pitched starting with IUI/letrozole, but he supported my more aggressive choice. I insisted on a natural start, resulting in 8 retrieved, 5 fertilized, and 4 frozen. We did not PGS test. The second cycle, he proposed using BCP. I was afraid of being oversuppressed and did not want to try this modification, but he assured me it would give good results. Unfortunately, I developed a lead follicle and he canceled that cycle. The third cycle, he proposed estrogen priming. I also fought him on this. Although I had 7 follicles going into retrieval, only 2 were retrieved. Both were alive at day 6, frozen, and confirmed to be PGS normal. 

I took some time off after the last cycle to undergo several back to back surgeries. In January of 2019, I insisted Dr. Reichman raise a request to the embryology lab for them to transfer the second-best graded frozen embryo in my batch. That FET resulted in my current pregnancy - I am due in three weeks.

I don't know that protocol Dr. Schattman used but he started me with Estrogen patches (after a positive ovulation using ovulation predictor kit) changing it every 2 days, till the 4th patch and getting my period. He then gave me letrozole for 5 days together with follistim/gonal-f and menopur. After a few days on those (I forgot exactly), I needed to get ganirelix to prevent ""maturing"" of my eggs. I had 1-2 that is growing faster than the rest. Then they gave me a Lupron trigger prior to egg retrieval. I have about 24 eggs retrieved with 3 embryos making it to freezing. I had one blastocyst transferred in October 2018 but failed and 2 morulas in April 2018 which also failed. 1. Egg retrieval using an estrogen priming protocol (20 retrieved, 11 mature, 8 fertilized, 4 blastocysts, PGS testing 1 normal). 2. Same protocol for round 2, cycle cancelled due to poor response. 3. Will begin shortly, estrogen priming with microdose lupron flare to see if it controls eggs better.3 IUI with Clomid, no success. One IVF cycle with estrogen priming and high doses of Follistim and Menopur, canceled due to nonresponse. One IVF cycle with estrogen priming, Clomid, and low doses of Follistim and Menopur, resulting in 3 day 3 fresh embryos transferred, no success. One IVF with estrogen priming, Clomid, low doses of Follistim and Menopur, plus endometrial co-culture, which was painful and not covered by insurance, 4 day 3 fresh embryos transferred, no success. One IVF with estrogen priming and Lupron flare (my request), 2 day 3 fresh embryos transferred, no success.I was on Gonal-F, Menopur, and Cetrotide, with an HCG trigger shot before the egg retrieval. I can't remember the exact dosages but he had me on a low dose of Gonal-F. I only had 5 antral follicles. We retrieved 5 eggs, all 5 fertilized, 3 made it to PGS testing and all 3 were PGS normal! We did not expect this and were thrilled, as my last miscarriage was confirmed due to chromosome issues.2 stimulation cycles. Both times mostly 150 menapure, 300 gonal f, then leuprolide added in. Egg retrieval and fertilization with ICSI using fresh sample. Waited the 5 days to see which embryos survived and did genetic testing on those that did. Cycle 1 - 10 eggs retrieved, 8 mature, 6 fertilized, 4 embryos genetically tested, 1 recommended for transfer. Cycle 2 - 7 eggs retrieved, 6 mature, 3 fertilized, 2 genetically tested - awaiting results. Still have not yet done an embryo transfer. Cycle 1: estrogen priming/antagonist protocol- 300 units Gonal F and 150 units Menopur;  eggs retrieved: 3
Cycle 2: low dose medication protcol with clomid-&gt;  (150 units Gonal F and 75 units Menopur;  meds were eventually bumped up due to lack of response)  we tried this approach given my body will never produce a large amount of follicles and I had been told by other parties that this is a good approach for poor responders/diminished ovarian reserve patients.  This protocol unfortunately did not work at all and I was left stimming for approx. 18 days without any follicles growing past 10mm and cycle was then cancelled.
Cycle 3:  returned to original protocol- estrogen priming/antagonist protocol- 300 units Gonal F and 150 units Menopur;  eggs retrieved: 1It was lose dose- i think it was 25 clomid on cycle days 3-7 and then 125 follistim. He likes double ganirelix on theses low dose cycles, but I thouht it may have been over-suppressive so i actually just did one and a half ganirelix instead of 2X a day. Dr. Rosenwaks informed us from the beginning that I may not get very many eggs from the retrieval because of low AMH/ high FSH levels, indicative of somewhat diminished ovarian reserve. I had a day 2 start after being on estrogen patches to suppress my eggs from having ones grow faster than the others because of my high FSH. I stimulated for 12 days on Follistim 300 units, Ganirelix cycle days 9 to 13, HCG trigger 10,000 units day 14. My egg retrieval yielded 4 mature eggs, ICSI, resulting in 3 day 5 blastocyst embryos. We transferred 1 and achieved positive pregnancy test. I was also taking intramuscular progesterone injections until miscarriage. Due to my diagnosis of POF, Dr. Kang started me off immediately with trying to level my hormones. She put me on a low-dose 0.05 mg of estradiol to help with hot flashes. I was given thyroid medication 0.05 mg to help my thyroid. I was given progesterone during my first IUI. I had already undergone 1 retrieval with another doctor, but after 4 transfers we never received a positive pregnancy. Therefore, we underwent  an egg retrieval cycle with Dr. Reichman. Unlike my previous retrieval Dr. Reichman was very careful in the medication treatment protocol. He changed the dosage daily based on results from my blood test. My previous Dr. put me on a standard medication protocol but Dr. Reichman closely monitored the cycle and changed the medication dosage as he saw fit. As a result of the low medication dosage and his close monitoring, I did not hyper-stimulate which I had done before. Gonal-F, Menopur, Ganirelix and then a trigger shot. Progesterone inserts following transfer and until I was 8 1/2 weeks pregnant. For the egg retrieval we used gonal-F and menopur, adding cetrotide in. Lupro and HCG trigger. 
For the transfer we used vaginal viagra, estrogen patches and PIO. Having irregular cycles, I started with a few rounds of clomid with timed inter course. I had 1 success but it was ultimately an early MC due to an implantation issue. She caught it right away. We moved on to IUI with clomid for first round second round (successful) gonal F shots with IUI. I had a uterine polyp diagnosed based on my HSG. So i had surgery (hysteroscopy) for removal, by Dr S and he was great, surgery was efficient and painless.  
Then i had 4 medicated IUIs with clomid that were unsuccessful (trigger shot was given to me 24 hours before the IUI).  Then i had egg retrieval, i was on a number of injectable hormone medications, estrogen patches, and progesterone oil injections.  I had 10 eggs retrieved, 8 were mature, 7 were fertilized, and 2 made it to the blastocyst (day 5) stage. I had both embryos transferred fresh on day 5.  This didnt result in pregnancy but i hope to try again (i waited for new insurance benefits to kick in and now i am waiting for the pandemic to end).  I found out a few months into my fertility journey that I had PCOS and needed to see a R.E. Luckily after HSG and sperm testing everything looked good on our end and we started letrozole. We tried naturally the first month. The next 4 months we tried with an IUI (we think one month we were a little too late based on my work travel :/).  We also use an estrogen patch to help with the growth of my lining.  We were hesitant to just do clomid to start because of my lining issues but we wanted to try a mix of letrozole and clomid to see if that would bear fruit.  The first attempt of trying to medicine we saw no progress but we tried it again (this was our last ditch attempt to get pregnant before IVF) and I am thrilled and it worked! I am just shy of 13 weeks pregnant. 

I cannot say it enough, there is NO other doctor I would have rather gone on this journey with.  Dr. P and his entire team were amazing, he is the best doctor and person out there!! We skipped right to IVF by choice. I was already well over 40 and didn't want to waste time on IUI or other less invasive methods. We did injectables hormones with daily monitoring, so dosages could be adjusted. I am a high egg producer so we triggered with a lupron and not HCG to prevent over stimulation. We used a natural cycle for our FET - which is preferable for many reasons now that we know how important the chemical secretions are during natural ovulation for pregnancy. Everything was up to date with the current research and with health and success in mind. We did PGS testing by choice since we'd previously had a baby with chromosomal abnormalities and wanted to avoid that outcome. We produced 5 genetically normal embryos from our first cycle, we froze them and transferred one. Our first transfer was a success, and the whole process was efficient and no BS.  First we did the antagonist protocol with estrogen priming. 150 menopur with 300 gonal-f then added antagonist. When that didn't work we did micro-flaire. Hi rationale was these are the most commonly used protocols. He did not tailor things to me AT ALL. Our IVF protocols included: estrogen patches, tailored doses ranging from 150-400 units of follistin, 75-150 units of menopur, anatagonist (ganirellix), leupron trigger, daily morning blood draws to tailor the dosages. We required 4 cycles due to poor egg quality.I used a combination of Gonal-F and Menopur for all my IVF rounds followed by Cetrotide with an HCG trigger shot.Natural timing, clomid 50 with iui, estrogen patches with natural, climbs 150 with iui. We went to Dr Reichman in the middle of an IUI cycle that we started with RMA. He was fine with taking us mid cycle. Because he saw us at each appointment (the RMA doctor didn’t see us for months) and because he did the ultrasounds, he was able to be smarter about the trigger date. When that did not work, he identified a polyp, and we removed it within a few weeks. The surgery was at Cornell’s new outpatient surgery center, and it was a great experience. Then we moved quickly into our first IVF cycle. We did the standard protocol (menopur, Goyal f, trigger shot). While it looked good initially, my estrogen levels did not rise as expected. Dr Reichman recommended cancelling to save money as we had limited insurance, but when our numbers looked a little better the next day we decided to go forward with it. He recommended genetic testing of the embryos, and we are glad we did because none of our four embryos were normal. We then quickly moved to a second cycle, in which Dr Reichman changed our medication. He used Lupron, which is used for people like me with poor egg quality. This cycle looked a lot better. We ended up with three genetically normal embryos. We tried a natural transfer cycle but again my hormones did not cooperate. Then we did a semi medicated cycle in which we used letrozole to ensure ovulation and then the progesterone suppositories. We then proceeded to transfer 1, and are now 10 weeks pregnant! Dr Reichman went out of his way to do our retrieval and transfer even when he wasn’t the scheduled doctor that day. It really meant a lot to see him in that room! Gonal F for several days, then I added Menapur and Centrotide for several more days. Trigger was Lupron and HCG. 
They retrieved 7 eggs, all were mature and frozen. Roughly wahat I can interpret from my records:

Cycle #1- 450 Follistim, 150 Menopur- 13 days to yield 5 eggs, 5 mature and none made it to Day 5
Cycle #2- 150/225 Follistim, 75/150 Menopur- 16 days to yield 11 eggs, 8 mature and none made it to Day 5
Cycle #3- 225/300 Follistim/75/150 Menopur- 18 days  to yield 5 eggs, 4 mature-- only 1 viable for Day 3 transfer.I was initially on a very standard protocol, albeit at the highest doses of menopur and gonal-f.  I will be on a new protocol with twice daily injections (still at max dose), micro dose lupron, and estrogen priming the second time around.We did four IUIs (three with Clomid/Letrozole) that did not result in pregnancy. We then moved onto IVF and transferred a PGS tested embryo via unmedicated FET. Unfortunately it did not take, so we did a hysteroscopy to rule out uterine issues. We did a second egg retrieval and medicated FET with a PGS tested embryo, which resulted in our current pregnancy.The IVF cycle was with gonal-F, menopur, and cetrotide. My trigger shot was initially going to be with Novarel but the team became concerned about high risk for OHSS so Dr Rosenwaks switched me to a dual-trigger to reduce my risk. I ended up with 18 eggs retrieved, 16 mature, 15 fertilized, 12 made it to blastocyst.Follistim, Menopur, Cetrotide, Lupron, Pregnyl, Endometrin
Results were excellent!
13 eggs retrieved
8 mature eggs
8 fertilized
7 day 5 embryos
4 PGS normal embryosFirst cycle - Follistim, Menopur, Ganirelix added in towards the end as the antagonist. Hcg trigger shot was 10,000 units. 14 eggs retrieved, 10 mature, 9 fertilized with ICSI. 1 early blastocyst transferred day 5, negative pregnancy test. Others were multinucleated and did not even approach the blastocyst stage. Trigger shot was done a little early based previous failed cycles with a different clinic, which produced no blastocysts between 2 cycles. 

Second cycle - clomid for five days total, after three days started follistim and menopur. Added cetrotide in after a few days. Hcg was 10000 units again. Had egg retrieval today, sounds like 10 eggs but won’t know until tomorrow how many, maturity, fertilization results. Not sure why the clomid first, other than I was using all donated medications and this is very inexpensive.  I am a good responder to stim so he used the same protocol for all three rounds: 225 gonal F/ 150 Menopur then added grlx use 5000 IU HCG trigger
We have a 2.5yr old who was conceived naturally. After trying for 6+ months for a second child we saw Dr Reichman. Given my history he suggested IUI/clomid. We did 2 rounds with no success. He read my disappointment and we agreed together to do IVF. During my first cycle, though 23 eggs were retrieved the fertilization rate was low and ultimately there were no genetically healthy embryos. I was devastated and Dr Reichman was attuned and empathic and we moved forward and he has plans to make adjustments during next cycle of IVF in order to address the issues w fertilization. Second cycle was a success- 30-something eggs, 15 fertilized and 3 genetically healthy embryos.  Over the course of seven months, we did five IUIs with no luck, moving on to IVF in June of 2018. It was a bit of a rollercoaster those seven months — taking meds for two weeks then doing the procedure, then waiting the ten days....and every time is wasn't the answer we wanted. But Dr. Reichman stayed positive. I remember every time I got my period after a failed IUI I would go to see him and his first response would something warm and encouraging. 

After our 5th failed IUI we decided to do IVF and I was actually really relieved and excited for it. Dr. Reichman carefully explained what IVF would entail and WCM offered a helpful course, so we began the process with all of our questions answered, ready to go. All in, the 10 days  or so of medication and daily monitoring wasn't so bad. Mostly it was enormously disruptive to my schedule but I didn't experience any pain or mishaps. 

We got 25 eggs which was a huge success, and ended up with 6 embryo. And as luck would have it, Dr. Reichman was able to do my transfer which made me really happy. That first transfer was successful, and I don't think I've ever been more excited than when I got the call confirming my bloodwork. Dr. Elias has prescribed a HSG to confirmed discussed diagnosis. Based on the results a Hysteroscopy is possible. 1 clomid cycle and TI, 5 IUI cycles of 100mg Clomid (1 was 150mg Clomid).  We were going to move forward with IVF after 4th IUI but we missed deadline due to time of year. For IVF: 150iu Gonal F, Menopour 75, Cetrotide. 17 eggs retrieved, 14 mature, 12 fertilized with ICSI, 10 made it to blastocyst.  Fresh cycle ended in a CP, Frozen was un-medicated with 1 BL and it was a success.2 IUIs, first cycle with Clomid and second with Letrozole. Second cycle elicited a larger egg count, but ultimately, both cycles did not produce a pregnancy. For IVF, we did a frozen transfer to allow for timing flexibility on the transfer (to evaluate the lining of my uterus) and the option to genetic test the embryos. Got 12 oocytes, which led to 10 mature eggs. 8 fertilized, and 6 were viable after genetic testing. Meds prescribed pre-retrieval were Gonal F, Menopur, and Cetrotide. Did the trigger shot the night before the retrieval. Followed the transfer with progesterone inserts. When I saw Dr Melnick I was 1 year into TTC with 1 miscarriage (first month trying) because my labs / test showed no reasons why I couldn't get pregnant again we started with natural cycle IUI.  The first cycle was negative and then we tried clomid + IUI for 3 rounds which resulted in 2 chemical pregnancies and 1 full miscarriage.  At that point I was certain nothing would work however Dr. Melnick suggested IVF with PGS testing (which was confirmed recommendation by 2 other second opinions).  We started IVF a few months later and had a very successful round with 23 eggs resulting in 12 embryos, 6 of which tested PGS normal.  Because of my history, Dr Melnick had me take baby aspirin and increased doses of Progesterone during my transfer and early pregnancy.  I had a healthy baby boy and am now starting to think about round #2!We attempted three IUI, first two with Clomid and third with Letrozole.
We monitored frequently (expensively) and I gave blood and had an ultrasound for consecutive days prior to procedure. Each time I recieved conflicting recommendations for when to have intercourse following the IUI. Each IUI attempt was unsuccessful and if there was any suggestion of explaination, I never heard it.I do not ovulate on my own due to PCOS. Dr. Reichman started me out on 2.5mg of letrozole to help me ovulate. He said that women with PCOS often respond better to letrozole than clomid.  I did not respond to that dosage, so the next month he increased it to 5mg. I responded to that dosage and continued to use it for 3-4 cycles combined with regular monitoring, trigger shot and timed intercourse. Those cycles were met with negative pregnancy tests, so Dr. Reichman did a procedure to test my Fallopian tubes to make sure they were open. They were clear so, we moved on to 2 cycles of letrozole and IUI. Our plan was to do one more cycle with IUI and then move on to IVF because my insurance would pay for it and my husband and I did not want to wait.  Since it was our last IUI cycle Dr. Reichman though I should try clomid rather than letrozole to see if it yielded different results. I did not respond to clomid, so I went back on letrozole and did one last IUI. This cycle worked and I am now pregnant!Antagonist protocol with estrogen patch. I had a history of asynchronous follicle development, so Dr. Davis chose this protocol. I had some of the best quality embryos to date, but unfortunately it did not result in pregnancy. He did recommend a protocol that they do at Cornell where they do an endometrial biopsy and grow your embryos on your own endometrial cells - which requires extra visits.
Estrogen priming antagonist protocol with 150 Gonal-F, 150 Menopur and Cetrotide.  Trigger with HCG/Lupron.  8 mature eggs retrieved, 6 embryos, and 5 day 5 blasts.  Shockingly positive results for my age and have to acknowledge the excellent work of Dr. Elias, his team, and the lab.  All were aneuploidy and unfortunately in this case, I was a statistic of my age group.  However, Dr. Elias still had a very positive outlook given the results and I appreciate that he had developed a strategy for the next IVF round during our follow up after the genetic results.I had a successful (yet complicated pregnancy) IUI cycle using Follistim and Ovidrel I. 2016-17. When I returned for continued treatment we attempted first to use clomid and letrozole to lower the chance of multiples. I didn’t respond to those so now I’m back to using Gonal F. So far, I’ve been responding but unsuccessful. timed conception, letrozole. I would say that Dr. Chung started me with the basic protocol and modified it, when he saw that it wasn't working.  With each round that did not succeed we would trouble-shoot to see how we could do things differently in order to increase our chances for success.  Dr. Chung even conferred with my gynecologist several times, in order for me to get the optimal results out of a hysteroscopy, performed by my gynecologist.  First cycle was clomid 50mg only but no timed intercourse or IUI. My husband had a viral infection and Dr. Pfeiffer was not sure if his sperm would be okay to use for the IUI.  Second cycle was clomid 50mg again with an IUI (this is the cycle I saw Dr. Pfeiffer throughout). Third cycle was clomid 50mg with an IUI. My follicles were very small and I was already surging when I was told to go in for my IUI the next day. Fourth cycle was clomid 100mg with timed intercourse because the IUI was not scheduled on time. The two follicles were small (13-14) and I was again already surging when I was to schedule the IUI the following day.  All four cycles resulted in negative pregnancy tests. We only got as far as letrozole and timed intercourse with him. He also missed my ovulation twice. For my first round, I used Gonal F 300 and night, then added Menopur 75IU  and Cetrotide (can't remember specifics). I only had four follicles from.  5 eggs were retrieved.  Only on embryo made.  Sent for genetic testing.  Embryo was not recommended for transfer (can't remember reasoning). 

For my second round (just started tonight), I am using Micro Lupron twice daily and adding Menopur 150IU and Gonal F 300 in the evening. fFirst I just did letrozole and since i have PCOS I reacted really well to it and began ovulating on the first try. Did this for a couple months. Dr. Reichman says normal couples TTC have a 1/5 chance of getting pregnant every time so he thought we should do that for 5-6 months. 7th month we did IUI after finding out that my husband had low sperm count, although he probably wouldve waited to do another cycle or 2 without IUI if we hadnt done semen analysis of my husband. Then we did IUI for 6 cycles. last 2 IUI's I was on clomid instead of letrozole so I would ovulate more than one egg and have a better chance of conceiving After he diagnosed me with mild PCOS, he recommended Clomid as a starting point as it appeared I only needed help ovulating more regularly based on bloodwork. He didn't push me to get other tests done right away (other than genetic screening) as he could sense I was hesitant, but after my husband decided to get a SA and it came back with a lower than average count, he recommended IUI to improve our chances of success. After the first round of Clomid didn't result in pregnancy, he recommended an HSG to make sure we weren't facing any additional obstacles, and he also recommended back to back IUIs for the 2nd round of Clomid. I got pregnant on that 2nd round, but if I hadn't we would have had an appointment to discuss our next steps and I believe he would have recommended moving on from Clomid after the 3rd round. Estrogen patch for a week before period
150 menopur + 300 FSH first few days, then added Cetrotide, HCG trigger shotI have had 7 rounds of Clomid and 4 IUI’s. My body responded well the first month to Clomid (I believe it was 50mg), but the second month only 1 or 2 follicles so the third cycle the prescription was increased to two tablets. This worked well for the last 5 cycles. Everything she prescribed made a lot of sense. Our insurance does not cover IVF - and, if it did we probably would have tried IVF after 2 IUI’s. She told us that the percentage of IUI working goes down each time, but she worked with us with what made sense financially. Because our insurance deductible was paid, we continued with IUI’s and Clomid through the rest of the calendar year. Now we are gearing up for IVF in this new year.First cycle, I went in for baseline bloodwork & ultrasound on Day 2, then took 100 mg Clomid/day for Days 2-6, monitoring bloodwork & ultrasound Days 12, 13 & 15, and trigger shot on Day 15 with IUI next morning (22 hours after trigger; 2.25 hours post collection).  Had 3 mature follicles (16, 20, & 21) on day of trigger.  Did not work and Dr. Kang said afterward that clomid had resulted in thinning of the uterine lining (endometrial stripe was 6.8 when triggered), so we would try letrozole/femara next round.

Second cycle did baseline bloodwork & ultrasound on Day 4, with 5 mg letrozole/day for Days 4-8, monitoring bloodwork & ultrasound Days 11 & 15, and trigger shot on Day 15 with double IUI next 2 mornings (26 hours after trigger, 1.5 hours post collection, & 51 hours after trigger, 2 hours post collection).  Had only 2 mature follicles (21 & 14) on letrozole but better uterine lining (9.4), but given my age if this cycle doesn't work she recommended going back to clomid to increase our odds with more follicles.I started low stimulation strategy with starting with estrogen patch, cromid, 175 follistim, 75 menopure. And then I got 5 eggs retrieved 2 fertilized.  Next cycle, he wanted to push a bit, and same except 225 follistim.  And we got 7 eggs and 2 fertilized.  He thinks that’s good result even only 2 fertilized.  The 3rd cycle, we kept the same as 2nd cycle.  We got 5 eggs but no fertilized.  I try to figure out his analysis for that now.  I don't have any trouble to conceive, but my husband has. On the first IVF round, we didn't find any sperm to try a embryo transfer. Later, he got in touch with my husband's doctor and find some new way to create sperm. So we got one embryo to transfer. Didn't get pregnant. During next years, we had the chance to have some more embryo to transfer, I did two transfer of two embryo (day 3 each) . Didn't get pregnant either. Now I think he wants to change something, I will have to see with him next time. Dr. Reichman determined that I had Asherman's syndrome and performed surgery to remove the excessive scar tissue that developed as the result of a D+C by another doctor. Surgery was the strategy because it was the only solution to this particular issue. I did not need additional fertility treatment following the procedure.No explainable infertility so we tried IUI before going to IVF. After 2 rounds a uterine polyp developed. Dr Elias recommended surgery to remove. I wanted to try one more IUI. That didn’t work so we moved forward with the surgery. After removal, I got pregnant the next IUI. I was never pressured to do IVF. Had a successful pregnancy after 4 IUIs. I did not react well to clomid and had to take injections. After thoroughly reviewing my medical background and after an examination, he was adamant about making a few adjustments to my lifestyle which may increase my chances of getting pregnant.  After being on medication for 4 cycles with another doctor and being told by that doctor to do IVF, i knew it wasn't right for me, so I wanted to get a second opinion from Dr. Reichman.  Dr. Reichman didn't put me on any medication, i changed a few lifestyle habits and got pregnant without unnecessary means.  He was right all along. Gonal F and Menopur for first several days of cycle. Cetrotide was introduced at around day 6 of cycle. Gonal F dose started out at 150 and dropped to zero at the end of the cycle.My insurance policy required 6 cycles of IUI before IVF was required and Dr. P tried his best to make IUI work for me, which it did! He would change my dosage and when I take clomid based on how my body reacted the cycle before to optimize our chances. For my first cycle we used estrogen priming, followed by follistim and menopur on relatively low doses then ganarellex for the last several days with and HCG trigger. We did two IUIs with clomid (each negative result) and one IVF transfer (successful).  Dr. Reichman advised that IUI was unlikely to work for us (unexplained infertility) and so recommended we try that no more than 3 times.  He was very confident IVF would work (and it did).From March-May we met fairly regularly to track ovulation to have planned intercourse. Throughout this process it was determined we had unexplained infertility so we began shots for our egg retrieval and embryo transfer in late May. To prepare for the egg retrieval we used Follistum, Menopur, and Ganirellix. After our egg retrieval I took a z-pac and Medrol.  Once the embryo transfer was complete we started with the Progesterone shots. I went through 4 rounds of clomid with timed intercourse. On the fifth cycle, Dr. Reichman gave us the option of continuing with timed intercourse or undergoing IUI. He explained IUI would slightly increase the probability of conception but it wasn't 100% necessary to proceed if we wanted to continue trying with just clomid and timed intercourse. We decided to proceed with IUI and got pregnant that cycleDon't remember that much but I the only thing I remember is that he favored low dosages and was very cautious about not overcooking the eggsWe are still in the process, but so far we have used letrozole with a trigger shot (ovidriel).  Dr. Pereira recommended letrozole in light of clinical studies that have shown better outcomes for women with PCOS.  We were not successful with just this course of action and Dr. Pereira recommended moving to IUI to account for low sperm motility. The first cycle we did with him the meds were not working, he took me aside and said, let's try again next month and try iui instead, bc the insurance will only cover one cycle. The next cycle we upped the hormones and added lupron, also this cycle, he preferred we wait another day to get more eggs ready, he told me his idea and his concerns, it resulted in 11 eggs and 3 day 5-6 embryos. Than mid cycle, one of the other doctors saw something in my uterus, Dr Goldschlag recommended we take it out bc of the strategic location, we did. I got pregnant naturally right after, he took care of me, but I had a miscarriage, we did a transfer right after which resulted in a beautiful boy. We started doing IUI with clomid and progesterone suppositories and went that route six times until we decided to start with IVF. I am currently undergoing my first cycle and have started with 150 IU of Menopur and 225IU of GonalF.All three times we used an antagonist strategy:
first cycle: 300 IU Gonal-F / 150 IU Menopur / Cetrotide. 15 eggs retrieved; 12 mature; 12 fertilized by ICSI; 6 day-5 blastocysts (preceded by 27 day menstrual cycle); PGS results all abnormal
second cycle: 300 IU Gonal-F / 150 IU Menopur / Cetrotide. 14 eggs retrieved; 9 mature; 5 fertilized by ICSI; 2 day-5 blastocysts (preceded by 21 day menstrual cycle); no PGS testing; implanted August 2019; currently 13 weeks pregnant
third cycle: 375 IU Gonal-F / 75 IU Menopur / Cetrotide ; 15 eggs retrieved; 14 mature; 10 fertilized by ICSI; 3 day-5 blastocysts (preceded by 25 day menstrual cycle); PGS results all abnormal

I (not Dr. Reichman) attribute the difference in yield between the first and second cycles to the extremely shortened menstrual cycle. My second cycle was done immediately after my first cycle; there were two months between my second and third.5 unsuccessful IUIs: 3 with clomid, one with letrozole that gave me an adverse reaction, and one with a higher dose of clomid that then caused me to have ovarian cysts so we stopped using that drug. Before any IUIs, she removed a uterine polyp she found. Then after those didn't work, my husband had a varicocele repair (minor male factor). She was then ok with us trying on our own for 3 months. After that the plan was to do 3 more IUIs, but we never did the third one because at that point I'd had negative reactions to both clomid and letrozole. 
IVF: low dose of follistim, menopur, and ganirelix. Lupron and hCG trigger. 33 eggs retrieved, many (I think 23) embryos produced using ICSI, one transferred, and 7 of good enough quality to freeze at day 5 or 6.When we first started together I had already been diagnosed with PCOS. The treatment was timed intercourse with Clomid, which we did 2 cycles and then moved to Clomid with IUI for 2 cycles and 1 with Letrozole. After 3 failed IUIs, Dr. Pfeifer moved us quickly to an IVF protocol controlling the start date with BC then started with Follistim (started with 150, reduced to 125, and fluctuated based on BW), added in Menopur and Cetrotide on day 5 of the shots. Trigger used was Lupron and HCG. We got 4 embryos from this cycle, 12  eggs retrieved, fertilization rate not ideal. We did a day 5 fresh transfer with 1 embryo and froze the other 3. The fresh transfer didn’t take, so we moved to transfer 1 frozen, this also didn’t work. Based on the results from IVF round 1 and the transfers, the recommendation was to try and bank more embryos, Dr. Pfeifer moved us to an increased dose of Gonal-F 225 adding in Menopur and Cetrotide on day 4, Lupron and HCG trigger on day 9. We got 26 eggs, 14 mature but 0 fertilizer and I had OHS. We regrouped after I recovered and decided to transfer both of my remaining embryos via a programmed cycle (using estrogen patches and adding progesterone shots). I did get pregnant with one baby from this cycle, but lost the baby at 8 weeks after hearing the heart beat at 7weeks. We took a 4 month break after that and started again with a cycle ( 75 Gonal and menopur at the same time, adding Cetrotide on day 5) Trigger on day 10 with Lupron and HCG. We got 10 eggs, 4 mature one day 5 embryo which we genetically tested. Recommend for testing came from the miscarriage and the lack of fertilization in the previous cycles. The embryo was not recommended for transfer. Because my labs were good, my age is ""young"" for the clinic, and I had given birth less than two years prior, she wanted to be very conservative and initially recommended IUIs without medication because she didn't want me to end up with twins. Neither was successful, so I then tried a third IUI with Clomid, which was also unsuccessful.
I went to a usual IFV cycle with regular monitoring.  I used Follistim, Menopour, and Ganorelic until the egg retrieval.  I used Novarel for egg triggering and afterword Progestorne.  Dr. Davis monitored our case though we did not speak to him everyday.  Egg retrieval was successful but we did not have mature embryos except 2 embryos used in the embryo transfer procedure.  The IVF treatment was unsuccessful but Dr.Davis offered additional procedures to increase the chance of success next time.The first two cycles of IUI were natural cycles.  Dr Periera recommended that because we only had male favor infertility secondary to chemotherapy and already had a daughter conceived nautwlly from prior to chemo.  However, my husbands samples always fell below the amount/motility parameters and I believe that is why I did not get pregnant.  The third round of IUI we tried clomid and a trigger shot which did produce 2 follicles.  But again, my husband’s sample fell below.We did 4 rounds of IVF, first 3 with the estrogen priming antagonist protocol (Menopur, Follistim, Ganirelix). For the fourth cycle, we added clomid for the first 5 days. I responded best on the first cycle (3 eggs), poor response the next 2 (one egg each), and a little better on the fourth (2 eggs). We did get pregnant from our very first cycle (transferred 2 day 3s, one stuck), but ended in miscarriage at 8 weeks from trisomy 15. Second cycle was a chemical, third I had a positive hpt but negative beta (likely another chemical), fourth cycle a BFN. A few weeks after our 4th cycle, we managed to get pregnant on our own and I’m currently 8 weeks along. I feel as though maybe the fertility treatments may have helped.150 Follistim, 150 Menopur for 3 days
125 Follistim, 150 Menopur, Cetrotide for  4 days
50 Follistim, 150 Menopur, Cetrotide for 2 days.
Trigger Shot, 80 units of Lupron, 1500 of NovarelAfter we were evaluated and I had done a hysteroscopy to remove a small polyp; Dr. Goldschlag advises we could start with IUI or IVF. We decided to do a medicated IUI which all resulted in negative results. 

We then moved forward with our first IVF in April 2018. We were excited when it resulted in a pregnancy but then it resulted in a miscarriage at 8 weeks. Dr. Goldschlag gave me the option of miscarrying naturally and we proceeded with a second IVF cycle in September 2018 that resulted in a negative pregnancy test.300 Gonal F, 150 menopur, Cetrotide.  We did PGS testing given my age. Estrogen priming the second round. First round, 8 eggs retrieved, 4 fertilized with icsi, 3 made it to day 5 (blastocyst), all anaploid.  Second round 10 retriever, 8 mature, 3 fertilized with icsi, 2 made it to day 5 (blastocyst), one mosaic and one anaploid. Menopur/gonal F and cetrotide with an hcg and leuprolide dual trigger. The egg transfer was frozen (due to possible polyp recurrence) and the FET cycle was natural. Then only progesterone suppositories for 6 weeks. Clomid for 5 days  (I'm 42, low AMH) and IUI.  HSG after 4th IUI.IVF #1:

Day 1-6:  225 gonal f, 150 menopur
Day 7:  225 gonal f, 150 menopur, 2.5 cetrotide
Day 8-9: 175 gonal f, 150 menopur, 2.5 cetrotide
Day 10: 175 gonal f, 150 menopur, 2.5 cetrotide 
Day 11 150 gonal f, 150 menopure, ganirelix

Day 14: 22 eggs retrieved.  
10 mature.  1 fertilized.  No embryos.

Day 12: Trigger thurs 1/24 9:30pm Lupron 4mg Hcg 2500
Retrieval 26 eggs 
0 of 24 mature eggs fertilized  As an Orthodox Jew, Cornell has a specific protocol they use to help push off the egg retrieval until a little farther on in the cycle (called the Mikva Protocol), to help shorten the period and keep any spotting at bay. 

Started with estrogen patches for a few days, then added a Ganirelix shot for three days, then started Menopure and GonalF, then added the Ganirelix back in, then triggered with HCG. My dosages were incredibly low bc of my VERY high AMH levels. First cycle was extended (I dont think the dosages were high enough and I was injecting them incorrectly so I wasnt getting the full dose). 

Second cycle was the same overall, but higher dosages and I had better quality eggs (more mature) than the first cycle. (Cycle failed due to Male factor component)

First IUI with clomid - did not respond well to Clomid, poor follicle and lining
Second IUI with Letrazol - started with 5mg a day for 5 days, three days off, then bumped up to 7.5 mg a day for 5 days. Went in and had 2 beautiful 24mm follicles (one on each ovary) and lining was almost 9mm. Triggered with 10kHCG and IUI the following day. I did four unmedicated IUI's with an HCG trigger shot using donor sperm. During monitoring for the 2nd IUI, Dr. Reichman noticed on the ultrasound that I had a potential mild hydrosalpinx, which had not shown clearly on the HSG I had done. We had a long appointment to discuss options and decided to do four IUI's and then move on to IVF. Dr. Reichman gave the option of surgery for the hydro, but said it was not required in my case.

I did an IVF cycle with 8 days of stims (Menopur, Follistim, and starting on day 4, ganerelix as an antagonist). My body was very sensitive to the stims and my estrogen shot up, so Dr. Reichman had me on very low doses throughout and had to adjust my dosage more frequently than usual. Because of my high estrogen and large number of follicles, we used a Lupron trigger instead of HCG. Specific dosages are below.
CD 2 - 125 follistim, 75 menopur
CD 3 - 125 follistim, 75 menopur
CD 4 - 75 follistim, 75 menopur
CD 5 - 50 follistim, 75 menopur, 1 ganerelix
CD 6 - 50 follistim, 75 menopur, 1 ganerelix
CD 7 - 50 follistim, 75 menopur, 1 ganerelix
CD 8 - 92 follistim, 75 menopur, 1 ganerelix
CD 9 - 42 follistim, 75 menopur, 1 ganerelix
CD 10 - 1 ganerelix, lupron trigger
CD 11 - no medication
CD 12 - egg retrieval - 24 eggs retrieved, 18 mature, 15 fertilized, 11 5-day blasts for PGS-testing, 4 PGS-normal embryos, 3 mosaic embryosFirst time i got pregnant in 2016 after a natural cycle iui with estrogen priming for an ivf cycle i did not need to start because i was pregnant. I then did 3 natural cycle iuis (because it was successful the first time). Started Estrogen priming for ivf but had to Stop protocol Because i had a positive pregnancy test. Turned out it was a chemical pregnancy. Starting ivf next cycle.For us, our infertility was male factor with no issues on my side. Because of this, and my risk of OHSS, Dr. Pfeifer took a more conservative approach to the stim meds. I never did more than 150 units of follistim per day, and then I also had menopur and cetrotide. And then progesterone in oil going into transfer.  They retrieved 13 eggs, 9 mature, 8 fertilized. By Day 3, they were concerned none would make it to day 5 in the lab so we transferred fresh at day 3. Neither took.  I had 2 embryos make it to freeze. The first transfer was positive but ended in miscarriage. Second transfer was positive but ended as a chemical pregnancy. We will be going for a 2nd egg retrieval in 2019 and I know she is going to up the meds a bit to try to get more eggs. We will do a day 5 fresh transfer (my decision, not the doctor's) and then PGS test the rest of the embryos that make it to freeze.  His treatment made sure my body is in the best condition it can be to to conceive before proceeding with further fertility treatment.  Since I have hypothyroid, he had to make sure it is at optimal level.  He has also surgical removed a polyp in my uterus,  which has been blocking egg implantation.  I have now done 1 round of IUI, but has failed.  I will continue 2 more rounds of IUI before moving onto to IVF.  Our first round was just Clomid, taking 50mg per day. My body responded too well to the medication and we had to cancel due to three matured follicles. The second round, we reduced the dosage of Clomid to two days of 50mg then three days of 25mg. My body did not respond enough, after the 5 days of Clomid, we didn't have any mature follicles. At that point, we added in daily Menopur injections. We did about 10 days of injections, at differing dosages, which Dr. Reichman adjusted day to day. We had two mature follicles, which was great, but unfortunately my estrogen had dropped to basically zero over 24 hours between injections. We decided to trigger ovulation and see what happens. Unfortunately due to my low estrogen the cycle did not work. We are now starting a third cycle of Menopur injections and hoping we can get my body to ovulate with the perfect amount of follicles. If that doesn't work, we will move onto IVF.Gonal-F 900 IU

2 clomid cycles with timed inter course. 1 clomid cycle with IUI.  1 ivf with estrogen prime, menopur, gonal-f, cetrotide - produced 9 eggs, 4 fertilized, day 3 fresh transfer of 3 embryos (bfn) and the other 2 embryos didn’t make it to feeeze. We saw Dr. Reichman after completing four cycles with another doctor.  On the surface, Dr. Reichman kept the same protocol, as I had a good response to the drugs: 5 days of .5mg of letrozole, an HCG trigger shot, and an IUI.  My monitoring appointments at CRM, however, were much more frequent.  I believe we had four or five ultrasounds before Dr. Reichman decided I was ready for the trigger shot, which ultimately took place a few days later in my cycle than previous treatment.  This meant my uterine lining was thicker than it had ever been, and we had one great sized follicle plus another potentially mature one.  He also timed the IUI differently than my previous one - this IUI took place about 28 hours after the trigger shot.I learned to my surprise that I had a low egg reserve for my age.  I would like to have multiple children and Dr. Reichman proposed doing IVF as soon as possible, genetically testing, and freezing the embryos.  This proved to be a good option for me.  I am pregnant now and have embryos stored as well.  I am hopeful that I will get to have multiple children as I wanted.  I took Follistem, Menupur and Ganirelux.Low dosage gonal F and Menopur followed by cetrotide with HCG and Pregnyl trigger. Few months of Clomid with trigger shot, then Letrozole with trigger shot (no IUI).
Very low dose follistim, menopur, ganirelix for egg retrievals with all Lupron trigger to avoid OHSS. 
Letrozole to prep for FET followed by 10 weeks of progesterone suppositories.IVF#1: For my first round of IVF, my protocol was 325 to 400 iu Gonal-F for the first 5 days, then 250iu Gonal F, 150iu Menopur and 1 vial Cetrotide for the next 5 days, and HCG trigger on day 11. I only developed 5 follicles, mostly on my left side, which was not as good a response as we thought I’d have. However, Dr. Chung did my retrieval and we were able to get 7 eggs. All 7 eggs were mature, 5 fertilized and we transferred 4 embryos on day 3 by Dr. Schattman. Dr. Pfeifer said that most of the embryos had fragmentation, so it would be best to transfer them on day 3 since it didn’t look like they’d survive to day five. The four that were transferred were one 10 cell, and three 8 cell. One of them was grade 1.5 (which is the highest) and the other 3 were grade 3 which are “so-so” quality. The cycle failed and I spoke to Dr. Pfeifer about what we could do to improve the next cycle. She said it was remarkable that all of my eggs were mature, even though I had some follicles under size 10 and 11 and that she’d trigger me earlier next time, with a lead follicle between the size of 16 to 17, since my eggs appear to mature at a smaller follicle size. She said she also would have me start Menopur sooner. She explained that they aim to have 90% of the eggs be mature. She said this could help with the egg quality because if you are triggered too late the quality could decline. Later on in my research, I learned that there are studies proving that older women usually do much better when they are triggered at a smaller follicle size. IVF#2: I started taking micronized DHEA (25mg 3x a day) along with other supplements 2 to 3 months before my 2nd IVF. I also saw a fertility acupuncturist 1 to 2x a week who prescribed me custom herbs to take before and after ovulation, did yoga regularly, and I tried to cut down on exposure to bpa/phthalates/fragrances, the use of household plastics and plastic food containers/water bottles. I had a better response for IVF #2. My protocol was 300iu Gonal-F and 150iu Menopur daily, with Cetrotide added mid-cycle. When I triggered, I had 9 follicles (6 on the right and 3 on the left) – which was 4 more than I had with IVF #1. On the morning of my trigger my follicles on the right were size 17.8, 16.8, 16.6, 15, 14, 11.4, and on the left they were size 15.3, 14 and 14 and my E2 was 1944. However, only 7 eggs were retrieved by Dr. Kang. 5 of the eggs were mature and 4 fertilized but they didn’t have the fragmentation that embryos had during my first cycle. All four were transferred on Day 3 and Dr. Pfeifer did my transfer. We were hopeful, since all 4 embryos were graded 1.5, which is the highest grade, but I didn’t get pregnant. I met with Dr. Pfeifer and I asked her a lot of questions, such as should I be tested for natural killer cells, should we test for dna fragmentation, are there any other tests I should do and should I try an ultrasound guided transfer. She said she didn’t believe in natural killer cells and didn’t think any other tests were needed. She said she didn’t think an ultrasound guided transfer would make a difference, but we could do it next time. Also, she said she was happy with how my second cycle went and would keep my protocol the same, except she would have me use the Estrogen patch before my next cycle. IVF#3: I had my 3rd cycle of IVF two months after my second cycle and it was the best so far. The number of eggs retrieved doubled, and the number of fertilized eggs tripled compared to my previous cycle. My protocol was the same as IVF#2 except I took the estrogen patch 6 days before I started stims, changing it every other day. My AFC on day 1 of my period was 12, with 6 follicles on the left and 6 on the right. After 10 days of stims, the morning of my trigger I had 9 follicles, 4 on the right (size 16.3, 16.2, 14.5, 12.5) and 5 on the left (size 17.6, 16.8, 15.2, 17.5, 14.6). My lining was 11-12 and E2 was 2440. I was triggered with 5,000 HCG. Dr. Kligman did my retrieval and 16 eggs were retrieved, 13 were mature and 12 fertilized. This was amazing considering I never had more than 7 eggs retrieved or 4 eggs fertilize. Dr. Pfeifer was surprised with the results since my response was significantly better with virtually the same protocol. This was the first time I had enough eggs to push to day 5. On day 5, I transferred 2 blastocysts grade 3AB and 2.5AB via a fresh ultrasound guided transfer by Dr. Chung, with a visiting doctor from Taiwan present. On day 6, I was told I had four extra blasts which were PGS tested. Two weeks later I was told that 2 were normal and one was mosaic, and I had the option of knowing the genders. Unfortunately, the fresh transfer was not successful but I am feeling hopeful after my recent follow up appointment with Dr. Pfeifer. She said she expects a 60% success rate for each frozen embryo and would recommend a single embryo transfer, and she is encouraging me to do a number of tests that should improve my chances for success. I did a lot of research on questions to ask and tests to do after a failed IVF cycle. I asked if I should do a saline sonogram (to check for fibroids), hysteroscopy, endometrial biopsy/scratch, endometrial receptivity array, and be tested for an infection or blood clotting disorders. Dr. Pfeifer said I should do an saline sonogram (between day 6 and day 10 of my cycle) and depending on the results, we would or would not do a hysteroscopy. She discussed the endometrial biopsy/scratch and endometrial receptivity array and said that it could possibly aid in implantation. However, since I had irregular cycles in the past, I would need to do a mock cycle with estrogen and progesterone prior to doing this test, so I'd have to wait another month before I could do this test since I need to start taking the estrogen on day 2 of my period. She didn't think I was not getting pregnant because of an infection since my white blood cell counts are normal, but she agreed to have my blood tested for clotting issues. She was so pleased with my improvement in more than doubling the number of eggs retrieved and the significant improvement in egg quality that she took notes as I shared with her what I did differently. I told her that I continued with acupuncture and yoga which I strongly believe contributed to stress reduction, and that my husband also made positive changes in lifestyle and also took supplements which I found supportive. I shared with her a very long list of supplements that I had been taking after the first failed cycle, including 500mg of Ubiquinol, 100mg of Pycnogenol, 75mg of DHEA and several others. I stopped taking certain supplements during stims and in the two week wait. I continued to try to avoid exposure to bpa and other toxins. I started doing more cardio and meditation, changed my diet to include more protein and good fats and less carbs and less gluten when possible. I also incorporated more warm, cooked foods, especially vegetables and bone broths. I tried to keep my carb intake under 40% but it realistically ended up in the range of 35% to 45%. I cut out caffeine except for chocolate. I had dark chocolate frequently and I cut down on alcohol except for a few glasses of wine on a few occasions socially. Dr. Pfeifer believes that diet, exercise and sleep are all very important to one's overall health and she encouraged me to keep doing what I am doing.My cycle hasn't started yet, but I have been prescribed:
estrogen patches for before my period to suppress my ovaries 
Gonal
menopur
HCG
Leuprolide 
z pack
CetrotideI was put on the estrogen patch to help my ovulation window be extended during the diagnostic tests and processes. There hasn't been much other treatment involved as we quickly learned my husband has male infertility and the only option for us would be IVF which isa journey we have not yet embarked on.1. Both IUI used Clomid and HCG shot - negative pregnancy results
2. IVF Cycle 1 & 2 use the same protocol except cycle 2 had 1 day less on hormones
Gonal-F - Total 900IU - 4 pens: 450mg for 4/5 days then decrease as close to retreival
Centrotide - 6 Kits
Menopur - 10 vials
Chorionix Gonad (HCG shot)
3. IVF Cycle 1 resulted in 2 frozen transfers (1 embryo at a time), both transfer took Progesterone vaginal inserts - both transfer resulted in negative pregnancy
4. IVF Cycle 2 was a Day 3 fresh transfer so took Progesterone oil.  Transferred 3 embryos, pregnant with 2 and miscarried at 8 weeks
We started with IUI first, On my second IUI cycle i was pregnant with multiples but miscarried 8 weeks later. The Dr was very hopeful that of we did more IUI's we might have another chance. I took clomid every cycle. Finally after the 6th cycle we decided the next step would be ivf. The Dr explained the entire process, medications and adjusted during the cycle if needed. Daily monitoring at the office was required to see how well i was progressing. I am currently in the 2ww. If the Dr doesn't reach you his nursing staff always do. We used an antagonist protocol for IVF stimulation followed by a natural FET. My fresh transfer failed. I took 1 month off then I got pregnant with my first frozen embryo transfer. Really cannot remember at this point. However, I always did natural cycles (ie. no progesterone shots) prior to transfer.I am not sure what the protocol was called, I know he told me, I just can't remember. My body responds well to the meds, (gonal-f, Menopur, Progestrone, Estrogen patches) he had me come in everyday because my follicles were growing quickly. We lowered my dosages accordingly throughout stimulation. Because of our age, and no found issues he kept the ivf cycle very simple. We did not want to do a lot of add ons (testing, assisted hatching, etc) as our insurance doesn't cover anything and he was great about not pushing those on us. He did strongly encourage us to only transfer one embryo, which I was fine with! Our cycle with him was very different in the fact that we did less medicine, and stimulated for a shorter amount of time then we did with our Utah Doctor. This was intentional as he believed they over stimulated me and left my eggs in too long. It was overall a way better cycle, and I appreciated his approach to our treatment. She diagnosed me as a having a ""smidge of PCOS"" as well as unexplained infertility. I did appreciate she taking all precautions before going through with any treatments (in my case there was some suspicion that my uterus bicornuate uterus so she recommended I go through an MRI to confirm. Also when I reported feeling extremely emotional when she prescribed clomid she switched me over to letrozole, which worked much better. She listed to my life situation and recommended an altered plan to proceed with IVF while my life (work and school responsibilities) got sorted out. My only kind of negative comment about the treatment strategy would be her lack of enthusiasm towards supplements. After doing some additional research I asked her thoughts on adding CoQ10, she was very unenthusiastic and said it couldn't hurt, but she also said that the vitamin/supplement industry is a multi-million dollar industry, etc. when I inquired about vitamin E and melatonin. I was a little taken aback, but respect her feelings.  1st round - femara 5mg 5 days, femara 7.5 mg 5 days - 1 17mm follicle - negative pregnancy test
2nd round - femara 5mg 5 days, femara 7.5 mg 5 days  - ovidrel - 1 17 mm follicle negative pregnancy. 
3rd round - femara 7.5mg 5 days, menopur 125mm 8-10 days, ovidrel - positive pregnancy. progesterone suppository for 5 weeks until progesterone levels were consistently high! My protocol for IVF started with estrogen patch and on day 2 injections of 225 Gonal F with 150 menopur with adding cetrotide half way through.  He retrieved 12 or 13 eggs and 7 or 8 were mature and fertilized via ICSI.  We transferred 3, none were viable enough to freeze and we were pregnant!  2 years later we went back for #2 with exact same protocol, one left to freeze which unfortunately ended up in a miscarriage at 7.5 weeks.  We will be continuing to try with Dr Elias when he says we can!I have DOR (mild) and my husband and a motility issue. We chose to do IVF given I am 31 and wanted to ensure we could have more children. The dr. Told us our best chances were Ivf with ICSI which is what we we did.I don't really know how to recall most of this, other than I always was prepped with an estrogen patch and then was dosed for about 2 weeks. I was slow to grow so it always took longer. I used 75 Menopur, 250 gonal f, and 1 syringe cetrotide primarily and then usually used HCG as my trigger. When I first met Dr. Reichman, I explained him that my travel schedule may not allow me more than 3 trials and I was fine with going IVF route the first time itself, but Dr. Reichman after carefully reviewing my medical history advised me to try IUI. He clearly explained me the probability of success and time commitment it would require. Before the actual IUI procedure he timed the trigger shot very well such that it worked as per his suggested date and time of the procedureHe uses an estrogen patch prior to he initiation of a cycle in an attempt to keep eggs growing at a similar rate and retrieve more mature eggs. He did a double trigger (lupron/ovidrel or lupron/bHCG) and also at times extends your trigger-retrieval interval to 37 hours based on recent evidence that 1-2 hours of extra in vivo time will better mature eggs. Coming from a bad experience, I just feel refresh with her and I understand my options better than the last experience. One thing I will never forget that she said to me was ""have confidence in your body"".  By the time I saw her, I had given up on my body's ability to produce anything. Now my view of my body is so positive. I had Multiple protocols with various success but Antagonist protocol seemed to work best for me. Gonal-F, Menopur and Cetrotide with an HcG trigger-- close monitoring to guard against the onset of OHSS.Came to him with two prior IVF cycles with complete arrest of embryos by day 5 and no transfers

Cycle 1: birth control start, 75 U menopure, cetrotide and gonal F started on cycle day 5, gonal F low dose and dose progressively decreased. 15 eggs, 13 mature, 10 fertilize, 3 transferred on day 3, remaining embryos arrested by day 5. No pregnancy

Cycle 2: endometrial biopsy for co-culture, estrogen patch start, gonal F only, cetrotide and menopure added on day 5, gonal F dosage progressively decrease. 18 eggs, 16 mature, 14 fertilized (all co-cultured), 3 transferred on day 3, remaining embryos arrested by day 5. no pregnancyAfter two natural miscarriages, we decided to move on to ivf. Low dosage stimulation with drugs resulted in 10+ eggs harvested. Several healthy embryos where formed and implanted one (frozen cycle). Very lucky first embryo took and resulted in healthy pregnancy. Dr Rosenwaks definitely wanted to start as least invasive as possible, we started with a very low dose of clomid for stimulation and an IUI. His ultimate goal is a healthy singleton pregnancy. The first clomid + iui produced a chemical pregnancy...though I was devastated, he was thrilled because it proved I could get pregnant. We attempted the same a 2nd round and it was a negative test. After that, I pleaded to start IVF because I knew that would more likely be successful and I was impatient. He was on board and he gave me extremely low doses of the stimulation drugs to prevent on complications. He is very cautious. My first IVF cycle was very successful--I have a healthy singleton live birth and 5 frozen day 5 embryos that are reported ""excellent quality.""Dr. Reichman noticed I had scar tissue blocking my fallopian tubes so he removed that, followed by IVF transfer, 5 day frozen embryo.  He also recommended genetic testing after I suffered from 2 miscarriages at age 38.  IVF was successful on the first try.He wanted to do a fresh transfer instead of a frozen one and wanted to transfer at 3 day since this was the old fashioned way.  He thought the freeze and thaw and additional PGD testing on an older woman’s embryos might be too aggressive.  He said we didn’t need to cherry pick at my age.  We used the same treatment protocol I had used with my previous doctor using menopur and Gonal f.  I started out with fewer eggs this cycle and he thought my ovaries maybe had a diminished response after having had four cycles previously.  Even though we had fewer eggs than I had had in my previous cycles and I was reluctant to continue with the cycle he thought we should proceed.  I took clomid, 50mg at for the first round and then for my 2nd and 3rd I was bumped up to 100mg since I responded fairly well. Unfortunately with unexplained infertility there was not too much for the doctor to do.

The 1st and 2nd resulted in a negative beta, and my 3rd produced a chemical pregnancy.Follistim/Gonal-F, Menopur, Ganirelex + hCG triggerI did 3 cycles with Owen Davis. 2 IVF cycles and 1 IUI. For the IUI I was just on clomid &gt; 2 follicles &gt; negative pregnancy test. For the first IVF cycle I was on Menopur and Follistim - 4 follicles, retrieved 4 eggs, 1 fertilized, transferred 1 &gt; negative pregnancy test. For the second IVF cycle I was on a microflare lupron protocol - 4 follicles, retrieved 2 eggs, 2 fertilized, transferred both &gt; positive pregnancy test but miscarried around 8 weeks.Egg freezing: Antagonist protocol
IUI #1: Natural
IUI #2: With Clomid
IVF #1: Antagonist protocol
IVF #2: Antagonist protocolI don’t remember the specifics too well, but we decided up front that, given my age and desire for multiple children, we would commit to at least two egg retrieval cycles and freeze them all (following PGS) before attempting any transfers.  I did those cycles back to back, and the protocol was slightly adjusted for the second based on the first cycle’s results.

I immediately began my transfer cycles after my 2 retrieval cycles, and unfortunately the first two transfers didn’t take (they were natural transfers - single embryo). For the third transfer (also single embryo), we adjusted the protocol slightly by using estrogen patches and including an HCG trigger shot just before the transfer. That was the ultimately successful transfer.My protocols remained fairly similar each time, as I was responding well to meds.

For all IUIs, I was on either menopur or follistim - &gt; 5th IUI resulted in a successful pregnancy.

I think I described them above. I only had bloodwork and an HSG. IVF was recommended but I chose not to proceed.I used 225 UI of Follistim and 150 of Menopur and then added in Ganirelix towards the end of my stim cycle. I was given Lupron and HCG as my trigger and then I opted to use Crinone instead of Progesterone in Oil after my transfer, as I was very anxious about additional shots. When Clomid + TI didn't work, we moved to Clomid + IUI. We found that when I was on Clomid 100mg, I produced the same number of eggs as when I was on Clomid 50mg. For my 3rd IUI cycle, I was taking 150 Gonal-f injectables, which was also unsuccessful. My first IVF cycle, I was taking 300 Gonal-f + 150 menopur, which resulted in only 2 follicles and a canceled IVF. We ended up doing another IUI instead, which was also unsuccessful. For my second IVF cycle, my dosage was reduced to 225 Gonal-F, and 75 menopur, later adding cetrotide before retrieval. I produced 4 follicles, 3 mature, 1 immature, with 2 fertilizing, but only 1 making it to transfer.Two egg retrials using Gonal, menopur and cetrotide. Medicated antagaonist Egg transfer.The first IVF cycle, we used injectables (Follistim, Ganirelix, and Menopur). The second cycle we were able to use what we learned from a failed frozen cycle to modify my protocol to produce better results. During IVF round 2, we went with a lower initial dose and continued that dose for a majority of the time, which while it sounds counter-intuitive, produced almost double the number of eggs retrieved (16). It was somewhat discouraging to find out that only half of the eggs were ""mature"", but we had two 8 and 7 cell embryos transferred and another which made it to Day 5/6 to freeze, which ended up being the one that worked.IVF + ICSI - We had male factor infertility with low morphology so he felt that ICSI was necessary to get the best quality sperm.  I believe my IVF injections were given to me in low, steady dosages so as to improve the quality of my eggs for retrieval. We successfully fertilized 11 embryos (out of 15 eggs) and 5 made it to Day 5. For our fresh transfer of 1 embryo, we were not successful. For our second transfer - a frozen cycle - I was put on birth control, lupron, estrogen patches and progesterone in oil. We transfered 2 frozen embryos and were not successful.
For our 3rd transfer - another frozen cycle - we did the same process and transfered 2 embryos. We are currently 6 weeks 4 days pregnant with 1. Our first ever positive in 2.5+ years. The only change this cycle was I had a hysteroscopy and lining scratch the month prior. We are just beginning my IUI cycle. It's going to be an IUI with Clomid. I do not yet know the dose.

The pretesting has involved:
A complete work up of blood tests 
2 semen analysis for my husband
Several vaginal ultrasounds
An HSG ( no balloon method)
A saline ultrasound 

We didn't get that far- he was only interested in having me come in every week to do a sonogram, take blood, and charge me $1000's of dollars while at the same time acting like I was getting on his nerves and wasting his time.

I went to another doctor aftwerwards who somehow managed to see me less often and got much more approved on my insurance.  We used a combo of follistim, menopur - then added ganirelix for a few days and triggered with a combo of hcg and Lupron (one night only). He did the retrieval himself which produced 19 eggs (in a 40 year old!) and 6 usable day 5 blasts. Only thing I feel they could have better prepared me for was the bloat getting worse post retrieval otherwise quite thorough. Also did one natural drug free frozen transfer since then- transferred one embryo which worked but ended in an 8 week miscarriage. I was grateful they were willing to do a drug free transfer and totally natural. Much easier. My first 3 IUIs were with Clomid. I produced 1or 2 mature follicles each time. My 4th IUI was an injectible cycle using Menopur and I had 3 mature follicles. My first IVF cycle involved Menopur, Gonal-F and Cetrotide. Dr. Elias thought I had 5 mature follicles, but on retrieval day, they were only able to get 3 because the other 2 were too immature and wouldn't have made it. All 3 eggs fertilized, but 1 developed abnormal cells and was not viable. The other 2 were graded as a 1.5 and a 2 and were transferred on day 3. My second IVF cycle involved Lupron, Menopur and Gonal-F. I did not respond well to this protocol and an ultrasound and MRI revealed a large tumor on my sacrum which led to my cycle being canceled. The tumor has been removed and I am now recovering from surgery and hope to resume IVF in May.I haven't yet started my IVF cycle but the protocol the Dr. is recommending is 225-400 FSH plus Menopur with Ganirelix.With my first pregnancy, the follicle size got to 24mm.  This is larger than it needed to be to move to the trigger shot.  However, this resulted in a viable pregnancy.   So he used this same method for all my Clomid cycles lat year (6 of them).  Two resulted in pregnancies.  Neither was viable, however.300 gonal f; 150 menapur; week 2 add cetratide. I produced only 3 follicles, 1 fert, 1 late fert, 2 transferred, chemical pregnancy;  the protocol was never altered, and I was never given estrogen levels or told follicle #s unless I asked or asked to see chart. IVF- We used estrogen priming, followed by Menopur 150, Follistim 300 + ganirelix added during the cycle.  With my diagnosis being diminished ovarian reserve, we only got 5 eggs of which all were mature but only 4 fertilized (via ICSI).  2 were implanted on day 3, none made it to freeze.  We ultimately had a positive pregnancy test with 1 yolk sac, but unfortunately had a miscarriage at 7 weeks.  Our next cycle is in the works and we are not sure of the protocol yet. Co-culture, Estrogen priming & 450 Gonal-f & and 150 menopur to stimulate follicle growth; cetrotide to prevent ovulation; HCG to trigger. I had 1 successful pregnancy from this protocol.

Co-culture, 150 Gonal-f & 75 menopur; cetrotide to prevent ovulation; HCG trigger. I had more follicles on this low dose protocol and had a chemical pregnancy. On our initial round of IVF, I was 32 and had no identified issues - our issue was male infertility - so was a fairly straightforward situation as these things go.  We used ICSI and ended up with 8 day 5 blasts - we put one in and we have our daughter and froze the remaining 7.  They were not PGS tested as that was fairly new at the time.  All of my FETs are being done on a medicated cycle using Lupron, estrogen and progesterone.  We have opted for a single embryo transfer in each case (he has suggested we move to two, which we are considering).  After trying to conceive for 1.5 years, by husband and I decide to see Dr. Goldschlag. After he first consultation and follow-up, Dr. Goldschlag determined that my ovulation was not occurring regularly. He asked me to come in for an ultrasound and determined that I had not yet ovulated. Based on the size of my follicles he gave us an approximate time frame for when ovulation might occur and we should try to conceive naturally. We did just that and we were successful. However, just a few weeks later I miscarried.  We now know that we can conceive naturally. However, du to my irregular cycles, my husband and I would like to conceive again asap. Therefore, Dr. Goldschlag recommended  that once my next cycle begins, our next step will be to start clomid and IUI.I started a protocol of 300 cc follistim, 150 menopur for the first 12 days of my cycle - around day 8 as I was getting ready for the retrieval, he prescribed ganirelix to prevent me from ovulating. I was monitored every day or every other day with blood work and then ultrasounds. I did not have any side effects, which I am so grateful for. I was triggered on day 13 and retrieved on day 15, closely following my natural cycle. Dr. Davis retrieved 14 eggs, 11 of which were mature. Of the 11, 8 fertilized with ICSI, and 5 went on to be blastocysts. I transferred a single embryo on day 5 - prior to the retrieval we discussed my desire to transfer just 1 embryo if possible. I was thrilled to get a positive blood pregnancy test on day 28, and now have an additional 4 embryos frozen for future use. Dr. Davis did not recommend genetic testing in my case because of family history and age; he explained that it was an additional step to freeze and unfreeze the embryos and that in my circumstances, the risks were not worth doing it.Round 1 ivf - freeze all, pgs. Then FET with two embryos. Resulted in miscarriage at 8 weeks. 

Round 2 ivf - clomed priming protocol. Day 3 fresh transfer. Live birth. We had unexplained infertility which is so vague and annoying that its even a ""diagnosis"". I did the HSG scan, blood work, genetic testing and my husband did seamen analysis - all came back good. We then did two rounds on clomid, with IUIs - one with trigger shot - and one round of letrezol with IUI. All were unsuccessful. I went for daily monitoring and blood during all three cycles. When we moved to IVF I had more ultrasounds, and then moved to injectables: Gonal F,  Menapur, Gonarelex with a trigger shot. I also took some antibiotics. We opted for ICSI, and the embryos were transferred day 3. We started with injectables for IUI's since I was 36 when we started. Goldschlag suggested we not waste any time since my husband and I had been trying on our own for a year. I felt he took the time to really look for any causes -he saw a slightly misshapen uterus and then sent me for an MRI which helped to rule out some factors. We did 3 IUIs with injectables and then moved on to IVF at Goldschlag's recommendation. We did our egg retrieval and have transferred one bastocyst and are currently in the dreaded TWW. I started with natural IUIs because I have regular cycles and had good ovarian reserve etc. My ""advanced"" age is a factor we considered throughout as well as being single. 

I tried IUIs three times and all failed. I used donor sperm so my egg quality was seen as a factor. I had a blocked Fallopian tube as well, but after repeating the test, it eventually opened. To help with egg quality, she recommended I try CoQ10.

We were going to try a medicated IUI, but based on my attempts, my age and egg quality, we went to IVF after failed IUI #3. I am just starting that cycle but it is much more complicated. 1 IUI - Clomid, Trigger Shot (negative pregnancy test) 
2 IUI - Clomid, Trigger Shot (negative pregnancy test) 
3 IUI - Clomid, Trigger Shot (negative pregnancy test) 
1 IVF - Follistim, Menopur, Ganirelix, Pregnyl, Progesterone injections (11 eggs, 9 embryos, 7 5-day Blasts, 2 transferred fresh - resulting in chemical pregnancy, 3 frozen) I had one unmedicated IUI, two medicated IUIs (with chlomid and an ovulation trigger), and then IVF using Follistim, Menopur, Ganirelyx, estrogen patches and progesterone.First I was on estrodial and progesterone for a few months in an attempt to restart ovulation naturally. Then I tried clomid, but that didn't produce ovulation. Since I wasn't responding, we canceled that cycle and I took medicine to bring on a bleed so we could start again with the next cycle. Then I started taking the nightly hormone injections, and finally my hormone levels started to rise and my follicle started to grow. I went to the clinic every other day to keep an eye on its growth. When the time was right, I gave myself the trigger shot injection. Then we did an IUI. Frozen embryo transfer over fresh - better success rates.
PGS testing - Dr Davis was neutral about this.  After several unsuccessful cycles, I did not want to lose time in case of a miscarriage.  I requested testing eventually and he did not disagree.  In retrospect, I would have started with PGS testing right away.  After batching 3 retrieval cycles with 54 eggs retrieved, only 2 were genetically normal.  Transferred 1 of the 2 and achieved pregnancy.
Meds: Follistim, ganirelex, menopur.
Medicated embryo transfer cycle: Didn't want to leave anything to chance.


3 IUIs with clomid. I know I used A LOT of drugs! I think I was taking like 450 units of Follistim daily, and 150 menopur daily  and I stimulated for 10 days each time. But I am older, so maybe needed more drugs. Either way, it worked the first time at age 41/42. So I guess he knew what he was doing.She felt that my first cycle was too long.  She shortened the second cycle.  After I reacted poorly to the second cycle as well, she put me on a low dose protocol.  On a low dose protocol, I had 13 eggs retrieved.  7 were mature.  4 fertilized.  3 were good quality.  They transferred 3 embryos on day 3, each of the three cycles.  Each cycle was better than the preceding cycle, in terms of egg quality.  Apparently, the meds were damaging the eggs.  According to Dr. Kang this is due to poor egg quality.  None of my remaining embryos made it to freezing.  None of the transfers resulted in pregnancy.  Cycle #1 - Micro-dose Lupron 2x daily 20units = 40 units daily until trigger
Result - canceled after 10 days because no response
Cycle #2 - Estrogen priming with patch commencing one week after ovulation; Gonal F 300u and Menopur 150u daily; Cetrotide 
Result - three eggs, 2 retrieved, 1 fertilized, D3 transfer; 8 cell no fragmentation; BFN
Cycle #3 - same protocol as cycle #2
Result - 4 eggs, 4 retrieved, 1 immature, 2 fertilized, D3 transfer; 8 and 6 cell; BFN
I met Dr Pfeifer in 2016, and the first thing she wanted me to focus on reducing my pre-diabetic numbers to normal. I was suggested to go for additional help from a endocrinologist. Then in 2017, Dr Pfeifer discovered I had uterine polyps and asked me to go for a surgery. In 2018, I had my egg retrieval after my insulin numbers were stabilized and then in October 2018, I had my egg transfer. To sum up, Dr Pfeifer in the two years that I have known her, tried to remove every possible hurdle that would have prevented me from having a successful IVF cycle.All I remember was we used lower doses of meds which resulted in 4-5 very good embryos each IVF cycle. My first dr/hospital used very high meds and only produced 1-2 eggs both times. Dr Davis took the time to see what was best for my body as opposed to some cookie cutter protocol. I don't recall his rationale. I am young and healthy, with no known fertility problems so I believe he gave me the lowest dose for injections. I had menopur, an HCG trigger shot, ganirelix and follistim. I would get a call almost daily from a nurse (throughout the cycle) to change dosage as needed.39yo, dimished ovarian reserve, 6 failed IUI cycles at age 33 with another doctor, 1 miscarriage (natural pregnancy) at 7 weeks at age 36, 2 cycles IVF at 39 yo,1 live birth of singleton girl at 39 yo

Birth control 
Lupron
Gonal-F
ProgesteroneFollistim (300iu) daily and 150 Menopur,  HCG trigger shot. Then progesterone shots after retrieval.  We transferred 2 Day 3 embryos since they didn't look like they were going to make it to Day 5, so Dr Chung suggested we transfer at Day 3, hoping the embryos would be happier in the uterine environment since they weren't development as quickly as they should.  Sadly, the embryos did not implant.  The original goal was to do PGS testing on Day 5 embryos, but that didn't work out.He first did an IUI with me because I didn't ovulate on my own. This resulted in an ectopic pregnancy. He then told me I had a 25% chance of having another ectopic pregnancy so I switched to IVF. After 1 cycle I switched clinicsFor the first 2 cycles with IUI, I think because of my advanced age I was on injectable fertility drugs vs oral. The first cycle was one IUI but the second cycle I did back to back day IUIs with 2 different sperm donors. Dr Kang recommended trying this in case there was an issue with the sperm, kind of a ""why not"" to cover all bases, though if it worked I wouldn't know who was the donor. If I remember correctly I took birth control pills for a little while to reset my ovaries before starting the next cycle. Had about a month off I think before starting injectables again for the IVF. With that cycle also gave daily progesterone injections after the transfer and for several weeks once I knew I was pregnant. I only had 4 embryos make it to day 3 so didn't have options of testing/sexing them. Utilized ICSI and transferred all 4. I think I was given <10% chance of getting pregnant, and of that <10%, <10% chance of having twins. I delivered fraternal b/g twins Nov 2016.Due to my age, 41, he recommended a low dose IVF protocol. Due to low ovarian reserve and a low retrieval rate, we did ICSI as recommended. Originally, we were planning on freezing embryos from several retrievals, but because my fibroid started growing larger during several IVF cycles,Dr. Reichman recommended switching to a fresh transfer, which we did. We converted several IVF cycles to IUI to try to balance our financial issues and insurance coverage with the prospect of a good IVF cycle. We first did a priming cycle using estrogen patches (to repress activity in the hopes that it would help stimulate for the following month).

On day 2 of the following cycle I began IVF injections. For 4 days I took 150IU Menopur and150IU Gonal F. On the 5th day we added a Ganirelix injection (to make sure one egg did not become overly dominant and cause ovulation) and that continued through the 9th day. On the 10th day of injections (Day 11 of my cycle) I took 40 units of Lupron and 5,000 units of HCG (to ensure ovulation).

The egg retrieval took place on day 13. 21 eggs were collected, 15 of those were mature and all 15 were successfully fertilized with ICSI (ICSI aids in the fertilization process and often produces better results than just laying the sperm on the eggs). 

We then waited 5 days to see how many embryos survived so we could send them in for PGS testing. It is necessary to wait until the embryos grow to a certain amount of cells so they can be biopsied. 

We then waited 2 weeks for the PGS results (1 out of 12 embryos can back unaffected with out genetic issue). 

On my next cycle Dr. Schattman did a natural frozen embryo transfer, he explained that in the absence of any other fertility issues natural transfers tend to have the best odds. I had a positive pregnancy test 6 days after my transfer which resulted in one live birth of a healthy baby boy. 



My egg retriAs a means to address what she decided was poor egg quality, my treatments aimed to produce superovulation, thus increasing the possibility of releasing a healthy egg. I released multiple eggs with each treatment, and only had one pregnancy--a chemical pregnancy--resulting on the 5th cycle of treatment. This, after having gotten pregnant naturally relatively easily prior to seeing her. We did 3 IUI cycles though we know it was a low probability of working. Dr. Reichman honored my desire to try every approach necessary even when we knew ultimately IVF was most likely the best route, He was supportive to my choices but made his opinion known. IVF using ICSI was inevitably the successful approach. He monitored my medications closely and, in my opinion, successfully with minimal issues. I did experience abdominal pain due to swollen ovaries for nearly a month after retrieval, but with 22 eggs retrieved, all mature, I imagine it's all normal. As our issues was male factor infertility, I was not put on any additional medications through IUI or IVF.I previously froze eggs at another practice using the same follistim/gonal f/menopur combo protocol from a day 2 start.  However, Dr Rosenwaks took a more judicious approach to medicating me, which made the process much easier and produced exactly the result he wanted (15 eggs retrieved, 12 isci embryos, 10 day 5 blastocysts, 5 embryos normal after pre genetic testing). Because I was not overstimulated by Dr Rosenwaks, the entire retrieval process was easier and recovery was much faster. Suggestions to begin a synthroid regimen helped regulate my TSH levels (important for the embryo). Estrogen patches helped regulate hormones during the menses before the cycle and after the transfer. Daily injections of Ganirelix and Menopur helped the eggs grow and multiply faster. HCG ccntrolled the release. All throughout this process regular sonograms and blood tests ensured that I my hormones and ""levels"" were at at a level optimal for success.Dr. Schlegel can schedule a phone consultation and review records/labs regarding male factor infertility regardless of continuing treatment with him. 
We were traveling for our treatment and first met him for a pre-op examination and final consultation. Dr. Schlegel was to perform a micro-TESE timed with an antagonist protocol IVF cycle with WCMC. Our TESE was actually cancelled because they found sperm on our operative day. Dr. Schlegel's office was probably more informative about the timing of the egg retrieval than the IVF staff. We have continued to stay in touch with him for additional consults after failed cycles and may see him again in the future should we decide to pursue TESE/IVF.Because I had success at my old clinic with IUI, Dr. Pfeifer recommended that we try three cycles of IUI with medication and trigger shot before discussing IVF.  She ran the IUI cycle concurrently with some tests I needed to have (a saline sonogram, AMH levels, day 4 bloods).  I took 100 mg of Clomid from days 4-8, then went in for a saline sonogram (not the normal course of action in an IUI, but they had to make sure my uterus was clear of scar tissue from my previous c-section) on Day 10.  At Day 10 they noted that my follicles were large, but my lining had some catching up to do.  I went back in for monitoring on day 11, they drew blood, saw my lining had grown a bit more and my follicles had gotten bigger.  I was called that day and directed to take an Ovidrel trigger shot on the evening of day 11.  I had an IUI on the morning of day 13.  Two weeks later, I had beta blood levels drawn and got a positive.  Dr. Pfeifer had me come in for two ultrasounds - one to confirm an intrauterine pregnancy at 5 weeks, and another to confirm viability (fetal heartbeat) around 7 weeks.He first started with an ultrasound and found that I had many follicles. He knew that it would probably be likely we would get a sufficient amount of eggs during retrieval. He also knew I had become pregnant naturally 3 times in the previous year. So he prescribed the lowest dosage of injectables for my protocol and a natural transfer, which was successful, I am now 15 weeks pregnant.Some surgery to remove fibroids. Then We used IUI with donor sperm. 3 tries to get pregnant over the course of 6 months (timing is tricky!!). Miscarriage at 12 weeks. Then 3 months of not trying while we regrouped. Then 2 rounds of IUI again and that 5th time worked!She talked about doing IVF at each meeting.  She wouldn't give IUI a chance even when there was no medical basis for assuming IUIs would fail and IVFs would succeed.  All my IUIs and IVFs with her failed, even though she told me I had a 50% chance for a take-home baby with my IVFs.  She was amazed at the number of eggs retrieved and the visual quality of the embryos, and yet did not bother to explain or phone with a theory as to why my IVFs failed.  She doesn't feel accountable or responsible to the patient after pushing me to do IVF for so long, to have good prospects, and then no pregnancy / very early miscarriage.  I went in to freeze my eggs. It turned out that I had a very low AMH. At the time I had been on birth control for over 15 years. Dr. Reichman suggested that I go of for a month and then retest my AHM. I did and it went up so we moved ahead. I was prescribed 150 of Menopur and 200 of Gonal. My Menopur stayed the same and my Gonal went up to 300 throughout my treatment. I also used 1 Ganirelex and a trigger shot. After my procedure, which yielded 10 eggs and 7 that they were able to freeze, I felt concerned that maybe I should have waited a little longer to see if my AMH went up more. Dr. Reichman could tell that it was really bothering me. He suggested that I get it tested after about 3 months. I did and It actually went up significantly. Unfortunately, my insurance did not cover the procedure, and being a teacher, I couldn't afford to do another cycle. I wish I had waited a little longer, but this is not a situation that can be predicted.  We did a course of meds to help me have a period (I forget the name) and then metrozole + metformin (25mg?). The logic for metrozole over Clomid came from studies that were showing better results in women with an elevated BMI. Dr. Davis used a basic protocol for me, with Menopur and Gonal-F to stimulate, followed by another drug to suppress ovulation starting halfway through, followed by a single trigger shot.antagonist protocol (?) Follistim, Menopur, Ganirelix. 2 weeks of suppression with OCPs. We started with a Clomid 100mg+TI cycle, as I'd done one unmonitored Clomid cycle with my OB and apparently not ovulated (PCOS), and my husband's MFI wasn't so pronounced as to make TI a complete waste of time.  It took that cycle to discover I needed a trigger to ovulate, and we repeated Clomid 100mg+TI the next cycle, when I successfully ovulated.  The following cycle we stepped up to IUI.  Our 3rd cycle with Dr. Spandorfer I didn't respond to the initial dose of 100mg so was bumped up to 200mg (I think?) and did ovulate, again IUI.  In December, continuing with 200mg/IUI I had visual disturbances on the Clomid, which Dr. Spandorfer took very seriously, and gave me the IVF talk. Due to my very high AMH, he was not open to doing injects IUIs with me, so we went to IVF+ICSI after our final IUI cycle was a bust.  We did a standard antagonist protocol with ICSI.  Started at 125iu FSH, went down after bloodwork monitoring, then back up, then down again, added in 1 vial Menopur/day after about 5-6 days, along with Ganirelix.  Triggered with 5,000iu hCG.  23 retrieved, all 23 mature, which I think says something very impressive about Dr. Spandorfer's management of my crazy PCOS ovaries.  16 fertilized with ICSI (which is around the 70% fert rate ""they"" look for with ICSI).  I developed mild OHSS ahead of the transfer, but Dr. Spandorfer had me come in for close monitoring to ensure the transfer would be safe.  We did a 5dt of one blastocyst (Dr. Chung did it - he was lovely and very encouraging) and were able to freeze an additional 7.   I realized I was successfully pregnant when my OHSS returned (moderate this time - incredibly unpleasant).  The upside of the OHSS was that I got a bunch of early ultrasounds to confirm an intrauterine pregnancy by 4 weeks 6 days, onward. I was released to the care of my OB by 7+ weeks, and the result is my almost 4-month-old daughter who's sleeping in her crib as I type this.  If we decide to try for a second, we'll go back to Dr. Spandorfer, even though he's not on our insurance any longer.Dr. Spandorfer has developed the co-culture protocol which takes cells from the mother's uterus to create a customized culture in which to grow the embryo.  I thought that was neat.  We tried that with him and a variety of different protocols (lupron, estrogen patch, etc.).For the iui I had used clomid and then they performed the insemination.
Ivf- birth control pills, low dosage of menopur and follistim. He added ganerelix when my eggs started to getting mature.
Follow the retrieval I started the pio shots.
For the frozen cycles I used birth control pills, lupron, estrogen patches and pio shots I'm a bit hazy on the protocol specifics.  I remember estrogen priming high doses of Gonal-F and something else I can't remember.  None of the DHEA or anything else that I've heard some doctors use for diminished  ovarian reserve cases.We used birth control to start my cycle, then 2 different kinds of injectables before the retrieval.  Following the retrieval I was on progesterone injections until I was about 7 weeks pregnant.We tried IUI three times, which I feel was a waste of time. It rarely works but I think the insurance companies require it before they allow IVF. He gave me very low dose drugs the first IVF round so I only made 3 eggs. Wish we would have  made more to have something to freeze. For the second round it felt like starting all over. This time he gave me higher drugs and I made 13 eggs and was able to freeze 2. So when the second round didn't work we had two left to do a Frozen Embryo Transfer round. That worked and we had our son!Ugh. Sorry - don't remember. Dr. D told me it was extremely unlikely (maybe a 1% chance) that I would be able to conceive with my own eggs but that he was willing to try.  

We did one or two unmedicated IUIs (with 1 chemical pregnancy), 4-6 medicated IUIs (with various doses of Clomid, an HCG trigger, and IM Progesterone after; 1 chemical pregnancy), and 7 or 8 IVF cycles (with various doses of Menopur and Follistim +/- Ganirelix; best cycle, which was early on, got 8 follicles otherwise 1-3; did 2-3 retrievals and only 1 transfer that didn't work).  

He then told me that since I was now over 45 and had even worse ovarian function, getting pregnant with my own eggs would now be virtually impossible, and I should consider adoption or donor eggs.  

I agreed to move to donor eggs, but said that while we were doing all we needed to do to make that happen, I wanted to go back to doing unmedicated IUIs on every possible cycle I could, so as not to waste even a single, potentially good egg while waiting.  He agreed to do it because I insisted, but swore it would never work.  The second one resulted in a normal healthy son.  He repeated the pregnancy test before calling me with the positive result because he didn’t believe it!Starting off: age 34, obstructive male factor & two failures at an Ohio clinic. (Sperm was frozen when I was 32 & we had a fixed number of vials that were shipped from Ohio to NYC; my husband could not tolerate another operation.) We did vanilla long Lupron, moderate stims, endometrial co-culture, success. Came back at age 37 & tried same long Lupron protocol; low response but did make it to transfer, negative. Then microdose Lupron; cycle cancelled for lack of response. Then estrogen priming & giant stim dose; still endometrial co-culture; success.I went through 3 different protocols:
1st & 2nd- Gonal F/Follistim; Menopur; Ganirelix
1st resulted in pregnancy
2nd resulted in more eggs. the first transfer, no pregnancy
3rd still had 2 frozen embryos and implanted both... no pregnancy again.
Upon suffering from secondary infertility, Dr. goldschlag oversaw my fertility treatment through: IUI, IVF, PGS testing. HSG, treatment of ectopic pregnancy. Fluid aspiration. Uterine biopsy. Fresh embryo transfer, frozen embryo transfer. Reconstructive c-section scar surgery. Hysteroscopy.I started with Dr. Spandorfer after unexplained infertility. My initial mark-up showed open tubes and normal range hormone levels except AMH which was slightly low for my age. We did 3 unsuccessful IUIs and then moved to IVF. Antagonist protocol with a fresh transfer. We did 3 retrievals with pgs and icsi, one natural frozen transfer and one medicated frozen transfer, all under Dr. Reichman’s direction Within minutes of my first sonogram, he noticed I had a uterine septum--something 3 obgyns and 1 other fertility doctor had missed. He immediately put me at ease that it was easy to fix and I shouldn't have any issues getting pregnant afterward. Sure enough, I got pregnant a few months later. He also put me on Letrozole to shorten my long cycle.I transferred embryos from another clinic to Dr. Pfeifer in order to do a FET.  All we needed to do was build up my lining; however, my body refused to respond to the estrogen.  So we tried various methods of getting estrogen into my body - patches, pills, suppositories - until one worked.  We didn't build much of a lining but Dr. Pfeifer thought it was worth then trying a transfer (I have a bunch of embryos) - and I ended up getting pregnant with that transfer.  We did two IUI's with follistim which resulted in negative pregnancy tests. We just completed our first IVF cycle. I think we did a pretty typical protocol with drugs. He said it was better than expected but unfortunately did not end in a pregnancy. Vericocele repair via surgery at first. Followed by Clomid for 2-3 months prior to egg retrieval. Stand by TESE, which was ultimately not needed. He only tried conventional IUIs and conventional medicated IUIs with injections to retrieve eggs as per my suggestion.  We are on our way to proceeding full on IVF next cycle if this cycle doesn't work.I was told to go straight to IVF since I have a low Amh.  I chose to do 2 IUIs first and I found Dr Melnick to be supportive of my decision and encouraging.  I am now going to try a cycle of IVF and she seems genuinely eager to do it and hopeful it will work.  Estrogen patches and clomid leading up to treatment. Follistim, Menopur and Ganirelix. 

My first transfer I took all the meds as prescribed (progesterone injections and vivelle patches) and had a negative beta. The second transfer, I was advised to take a baby aspirin and I received a positive beta. Now, I'm being referred to a hematologist before another transfer as Dr. Kang feels there may be an issue with adequate blood flow to the developing fetus. I feel as though each step gets me closer to a successful pregnancy.Menepur, follistim, gonal f, ganirelex and poi .  No Lupton.  For fet  we did estrogen patches and poi.  I was a slow responder to IVF. I produced 11 eggs, 9 of which fertilized but was on drugs for 15-16 days. The embryo quality was poor. I transferred 2 day 3 embryos and the rest didn't make it to blast stage. He kept my doses low and slow so there was never an issue with over stimulation. I felt the process was taking longer then it should’ve but he seemed to know the exact right moment for the trigger and played around with dosages to receive the results he was looking for.IVF with single embryo transfer followed by multiple frozen transfers. While my egg retrieval was very successful with multiple good quality blasts, all transfers failed. I had one antagonist protocol. All i really remember from that cycle was a high dosage of stims. the next cycle was a low dose clomid cycle. and the third cycle was a low dose clomid cycle with estrogen during the tww. he suggested a hysteroscopy in between cycle 2 and 3 and there was a polyp removed. I don't remember the details on this. Natural cycle IUIs, medicated IUIs, IVF, ICSI, batching, PGS, frozen transfer. PGS with frozen transfer was ultimately successful. Sorry I don't really remember.I did three rounds of Clomid and two rounds of Gonal-F. I was 37 to 39 at the timeI did 1 medicated iui which was u successful after that we moved to ivf with icsi. We did a 5 day fresh transfer with remaining embryos pgs tested. I was on estrogen primed anatogonist protocolI don't really remember the protocol. The last treatment I had was in September. I am now in the process of a donor egg cycle due to DOR.My wife first attempted with Clomid only for approximatley 3-4 months followed by 4-5 months of IUI. We are now going for IVF starting in March.Dr. Kang used a minimum protocol for us, which is what we had in mind and what we had hoped for. We are prepping for an IVF and in the meanwhile we tried an IUI.Dr Reichman recommended PGS testing at the first retrieval, which I was not sure about but it was the right call since 50% of my embryos ended up being abnormal. IVF
day 3 embryo transfer - he wasn't sure the embryos would grow to day 5
2 embryo transfer to increased the chance of success Ivf with ICSI and PGDHigh gonal F; we did 5 rounds.  First 4 not so successful.  Embryos frozen at day 3 for the first four rounds. Last (5th) round we got 23 eggs and 17 embryos grew to day 6.  8 are PGD tested that were normal and I asked the sex of those.  We will use those first.He used 300 gonalf and 150 menapour.We started with Letrozole 2.5mg and timed intercourse with frequent ultrasounds. I didn't respond to Letrozole 2.5mg, but I did respond to 5mg. I recieved an HCG shot and got pregnant with timed intercouse. I was told to try 6 rounds of IUI first because he doctor didn’t see a medical reason why I shouldn’t get pregnant. After those six rounds, we will now reconsider the best option, IUI with clomid or IVF. Not sure.I don’t remember but I know I took a lot of progesterone for a long time because mine was low. There were many. Estrogen patches, progesterone, injectibles, surgeries We tried estrogen priming, low dose stimulation, microdose flare. Used Gonal F, menupour, Cetrotide and HCG. For low dose IVF used clomid. Most times 3 day fresh transfer. Estrogen patch then ganorelix antagonist and follstim/menopur. Dual trigger shot for retrieval.  Daily titration of medication.Egg retrieval gonal f, menopur and cetrotide. Fresh transfer: progesterone. BFN. FET 1. Natural cycle c progestrone suppositories. BFP, but miscarriage at 6 weeks. FET 2 natural cycle w progesterone injections 1cc, baby aspirin and folic acid. BFN. IVF for fertility preservation prior to chemo and IUI with clomid post cancer treatment. The plan was to proceed without medication, especially after tests showed that my body was functioning exceptionally. If the first IUI was unsuccessful, I would have a D&C, proceed with medication. The D&C was due to build up in keep uterus (at least that was my understanding). Also, I have a fibroid he was concerned marginally with. IVF would be our last ditch effort.I was instructed to cut back on working out and gain a few pounds. 5 months of blood work and monitoring. 3 months of trigger shots and clomid. Successfully conceived on 3rd try without further intervention. my first cycle was a fresh cycle, transfer at day 3 of 2 embryos- didn't work. My second was a frozen on a natural cycle and it worked but no heart beat at 8 weeks. Had a D&C and then  testing in November. STarted a new retrieval in January and did retrieval on 2-1 then a ""scraping"" on 2-7. The embryos were transferred on a frozen natural cycle and it worked!I had 2 rounds of Chlomid and Ovidrel (trigger shot). After measuring eggs every other day she used Ovidrel 2days before the IUI. first 1 resulted in pregnancy but 6 week MC. 2nd time resulted in pregnancy so far this one is healthy.My husband was put on Clomid. He completed a bunch of Seman Analysis. Finally he was put on another drug to reduce his estrogen levels. He will be completing a TESE soon.Estrogen Patch Prime. Clomid + 150 Menopure and 150 Follistim. Used micro dose Lupron approach for a number of cycles and last cycle used estrogen priming and clomid. Used gonal f, menopur, ganirelix. They also as a Center believe in doing IM progesterone injections relative to a suppository. Gonal f 150 first two nights, then 100, then 75, last 3 nights at 50. 
Menopur 75 every night 
Ganilrelex started on night 4
Responded well. I was diagnosed with egg quality issues so after a failed clomid cycle I went straight to injectables. When that didn't not work twice I went onto ivf...I thought it was a little extreme but while I took a month off I got pregnant with a chemical pregnancy and decided right then that I agreed with dr.kAng and went thru with ivf.We used an antagonist protocol with 20 eggs retrieved,  16 mature, 12 fertilized, 5 day 5 embryos (my previous doc said my embryos would not make it to day 5)Clomid (1st round IUI). Clomid and Gonal F / Follistim (2nd round IUI). Both were negative cycles.Good ovarian reserve detected; antagonist protocol. ICSI identified for next cycle due to MFII have been through so many IVF cycles that is hard to remember what he did. I know it was called estrogen priming where I wore a patch after my period. I also remember that he did give me as many drugs as my STL doctors. I felt the best will on his protocol.I don't remember that well - I was also getting IVIG, steroid, and other treatment separately via Dr Jonathan Scher who had diagnosed me with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and with recurrent miscarriages.We did 2 fresh donor egg transfers and 1 frozen.  The fresh were both day 3 transfers because the embryos did not look good. None of the cycles worked.  He also advised to do a hysteroscopy.  It was fruitless and didn't yield any information at all. I don't remember specifics, but he was much more professional and exacting and scientific than our previous doctor. He's not going to be your best friend, but he was kind and compassionate, and he was excellent at his work and took it very seriously. 450ml Follistim + micro dose of LupronI don’t remember exactly I don’t remember. I was on a lot of medicine for a long time bc I am a poor responder.  2 fresh cycles resulted in 3 kids. My protocol is pretty high dosage on medication, yet still low count of egg counts at the end of the cycle. Don't recallFollistim + MenopurWe used IUIBcp, Menepur, follistim/final f, ganirelix, hug trigger.  Our only issue was egg quality.  the levels were very low for age.  I had my right fallopian tube removed due to a hydrosalpinx, went on 50 mg and then 100 mg of clomid, injectable and two IUIs. Menepur, follistim, ganirelex, poi.  

Donor cycle:  estrogen patches and poi.  I was timid, so we started with the least invasive treatment options and worked our way from there as my comfort level grew. Dr. Reichman never pressured me and always made sure I understood my options and had all of the facts.I was a poor responder to the I VF drugs. Dr. Davis put me on a protocol for poor responders  which resulted in my nine-year-old son Max Lupron for mini cycle. 
Menopur for regular cycleEStrogen priming protocol with low stims, estrogen priming with clomidIui w clomid and letrozole. Then retrieval w gonolith and menopur after ocp. Transfer w ocp, lupron, the  estrogen patch and progesterone.Patch, gonal, menopur and ganerelix We did them ALL.    You name it, we tried it.I only saw Dr. Pfeifer for a consultation. I intend to go through an egg freezing cycle however the clinic closed temporarily because of Covid-19 before I got the chance to. Dr. Pereria's prescribed doses of letrozole and timed intercourse led to pregnancy our first cycle with him.Medications prescribed: Menopur, Gonal-F, CetrotideFollistim, Menopur, Ganirelix, estrogen priming. I'm over 40 so the doses were high. I got pregnant but miscarried. He used the antagonist protocol (similar to my previous clinic), but he added some progesterone shots and changed the medication dosage depending on my results (which did not happen before)Diagnosed with Diminished Ovarian Reserve. 
Protocol 1: 375 Gonal-f, 150 Menopur, Lupron and Cetrotide before HCG trigger 
Protocol 2: Microdose Lupron 20 units AM/PM,  300 Gonal-f, 150 Menopur, HCG triggerI received a cycle of hormone injections and then when ready I had an IUI.So I were I took the pills for 5 days which did not give me any side effect. I got the trigger injection and also no side effect. He recommended that I have an HSG (special X-ray) done. The radiologist said the report as normal however Dr. Elias disagreed. I went ahead with his recommendation to do a laparoscopy and sure enough my left Fallopian tube was blocked and needed to be removed. After failed IUIs I went through one round of IVF. I do one transfer which didn’t work and I have two eggs frozen. Last month I actually got pregnant on my own but unfortunately it was not a normal pregnancy. I am continuing treatment with Dr. Elias. I did estrogen patches due to my FSH of 7. Once I started stimulation my dose was 300 fsh and 150 menopur with antagonist.  I did ISCI and PGS. I had 10 eggs retrieved, 7 fertilized and made it to blastocyst stage, 3 were PGS normal Given the age, he told us we needed to try IVF as soon as possible and had Genetic testing. After second cycle was done, reconsidering some embryos were gone while waiting genetic testing, we changed plan to fresh transfer and finally made it.
I did three IUI cycles I believe with clomid. Another cycle just clomid and sex. After negative results I had to have a laparoscopy and my fallopian tube removed. Then IVF was suggested and due to insurance reasons i had to switch practices. Conservative with rushing to IVF. Doesn’t push patients to go that route until it’s needed.Don’t remember When I first started seeing him, Dr. Pereira had me begin with a lower dose of letrozole to jump-start ovulation. As it did not work in the first cycle, he increased the dosage and began prescribing trigger shots as well. When this treatment did not work after 3 cycles, he moved me to a combination of Clomid and letrozole, which did help me to ovulate. After ovulating twice without a pregnancy, Dr. Pereira suggested I try an IUI as well, and I got pregnant on the first try. With a history of PCOS and after 3 failed IUI attempts , were not sure if we should directly jump to IVF. Due to the huge costs associated we wanted to give TI/IUI few tries and Dr Pereira completely supported this decision. We were put on a 7 day Letrozole cycle and were regularly called in for monitoring cycles. Once the egg was of a suitable size we used to self-administer Ovidrel injections as advised by the doctor or nurse. The 3rd cycle TI cyle yielded a positive result.We did three rounds of IVF. Admittedly, the details are a bit foggy, but each round involved injections of Gonal-G, menopur and cetrotide.  Our doses changed according to the results of my bloodwork and the number and size of developing follicles revealed in sonograms. I distinctly remember delaying the start of a cycle based on a sonogram following my most recent period. Dr. Reichman didn't feel the timing was right and chose to push to the next month, which ended up being a much better month follicle-wise. Each round is a learning experience and our results improved every cycle. 

Our first frozen embryo transfer did not take. For our second transfer, Dr. Reichman decided to do a ""programmed transfer"" where we would manipulate my hormones. While my progesterone levels had historically been fine, he chose to prescribe nightly progesterone shots five days before the transfer, 10 days following the transfer (until the results of the pregnancy test), and since we are pregnant, through the first trimester. This was done as a precautionary measure to support the lining of the uterus (until the placenta takes over and produces its own hormones). Additionally, I have worn estrogen patches throughout this time since my estrogen has been consistently low. As my estrogen has increased, the number of patches has decreased in the last week.  Dr. Pereira recommended I try medication that would cause superovluation to give us a better chance at conceiving naturally.  I ended up reacting very strongly to Clomid and ovulated very quickly and developed an ovarian cyst.  We switched to Letrozole, and I did get pregnant that month, but that resulted in a chemical pregnancy and the discovery of a uterine polyp.  After removing the polyp, we tried another round of Letrozole, and were able to conceive naturally that cycle.I had been on birth control pills for 10 or so years without a break and without a proper heavy period. When I stopped the pill, I had 2 periods across 8 months, that's when I decided to go see Dr Pereira. He immediately put me on clomid to wake up my ovaries. His plan included 2 cycles of clomid with timed intercourse, if that didn't work then move on to IUI. That's exactly what we did. The IUI treatments included an ovidrel trigger shot administered by the nurse. I got pregnant after the 2nd IUI. Due to my diminished ovarian reserve and unsuccessful IUI at another clinic, we went straight to IVF. We did 2 back to back retrievals to make sure we have enough embryos, always using ICSI and microfluidics. 1st retrieval - 4 eggs, 3 mature, 3 fertilized, 2 made it to Day 5 and came back PGD normal. 2nd retrieval - 5 eggs, 5 mature, 5 fertilized, 4 made it do Day 5 and PGD normal. Then we did 3 back to back single embryo transfers. 1st natural FET - negative, 2nd natural FET - chemical, 3rd programmed FET - chemical. Dr. Reichman was surprised we didn’t have successful pregnancy yet, so he completely switched the approach. We did another IVF (10 eggs, 10 mature, 9 fertilized) and did a fresh transfer of 2 8-cell embryos on Day 3. It was a negative again, so he did a hysteroscopy to rule out uterine factor. We then proceeded to another IVF, this time using testicular sperm to circumvent the male factor. We had 7 eggs, 5 mature, 3 fertilized, 2 made it to day 3, we did a fresh transfer of 2 embryos (8-cell and 6-cell) on Day 3, which ultimately succeeded. I am now 8 weeks pregnant with singleton, and so far it seems viable and strong pregnancy. I used Gonal F and other meds as prescribed by Dr. Reichman.  We used PGD and did a thorough assessment of the embryos as recommended by Dr. Reichman and the CRM Staff.  We used the ICSI procedure as well.  I had a high probability of a male child afflicted with the Fabry's disease - hence we took all the necessary steps to make sure that the result is a healthy baby.As I had gotten pregnant two times previously on my own before visiting Cornell (and lost them), he started me out by putting me on Progesterone supplements post ovulation surge. I became pregnant naturally after my first cycle under his care and all was going well until week 9, when a heartbeat could no longer be detected. After testing it was determined that the fetus likely died due to a blood clot as it was 'normal' and I have Factor V Leiden blood clotting disorder. It was decided at that point that I would give myself daily Enoxaparin Sodium injections starting with my next positive pregnancy test. We decided to try IUI to increase our pregnancy success rate and got pregnant. Unfortunately I lost that pregnancy too at about 6 weeks though giving myself injections (on top of Progesterone supplements). Not wanting to deal with a 5th pregnancy loss that could potentially be due to an abnormal embryo, my husband decided to take aggressive action with IVF. We became pregnant with our first transfer of one embryo and I am currently 16 weeks pregnant and will be giving myself daily 40mg injections of Enoxaparin Sodium through my pregnancy. He kept tweaking until it worked. I know the progesterone was one of our biggest and unexplained issues. He boosted my own progesterone during the successful cycle to assist with the injectables.In my case, my eggs were poor quality.  Which Dr. Reichman mentioned, could be a possibility, during our first consult with him.  He recommended Genetic Testing.  We knew I could conceive but we couldn't control which egg was being fertilized.  By having the eggs Genetically tested, we were able to transfer the healthiest egg.  So I took injections for a few weeks, went for the egg retrieval, waited for the lab tests, had the genetic testing done, and finally had the egg transfer.  I am now almost 2mo pregnant and all is going well.  During IVF, Dr. Reichman ordered a protocol of almost-daily monitoring (usually ultrasound and bloodwork). He was erring on the side of caution, which was a comfort, as I was at risk for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). He prescribed low dosages of Gonal-F and Menopur, increased dosage, then lowered dosage by 10-15 units according to my bloodwork each day. I injected the trigger shot on day 14. Fourteen eggs were retrieved two days later. Five embryos were cryopreserved, one was a fresh transfer on day 5. The embryo successfully implanted. 
He was very careful with my dosages to avoid OHSS and clearly explained the risks and possibilities. One round of Clomid unsuccessful 
No IUI
One successful round of IVF with ICSI resulting in a singleton pregnancy I got lucky with the first one.  We just did clomid and my partner couldnt do the iui and it happened to work!We first underwent a uterine septum repair and polypectomy. Then, we underwent 8 IUI cycles, 3 of which we used clomid. Eventually, we underwent one cycle of IVF and one subsequent embryo transfer that was successful. I had 10 failed cycles with different medicines (clomid, injectibles etc.) when I switched to Reichman. While I was doing all of the necessary pre-op stuff for IVF we did one more Clomid + IUI that was unsuccessful. For the IVF we were doing a fresh transfer so he tried to get as many eggs as possible without hyper-stimulating when the egg was transferred. All went well and the transfer was successful. For IUI there were no treatments.  For IVF with donor egg/sperm, I was given estrogen patch and progesterone protocols.   I am currently 4 months pregnant with a little girl and extremely excited.Don't recallI feel very fortunate because I was able to conceive after my second cycle with Dr. P.  I came to him after trying for several months and doing 3 cycles of clomid with my OB/GYN.  I did 2 cycles of Letrozole/monitoring with Dr. Pereira and conceived the second one.  The nurses call with the analysis of your bloodwork to tell you the best time to have sex.  The level of detail is just amazing.Dr. P wanted to observe my eggs naturally for one cycle to see how large the follicle gets to better help us time the trigger for IVF.  During the monitoring he thought we mine as well try an IUI because our morphology issue was not as bad as we were originally told.  The IUI resulted in a positive and continuing pregnancy (currently 15W)When I first started seeing him I had been trying to conceive for about a year unsuccessfully at the age of 38. He explained basically everything about human reproduction and how age affects it, did base line testing and then discussed a strategy with me. Timed intercourse did not yield a positive pregnancy test the first cycle so, as we had discussed when I first consulted with him, for the second cycle he prescribed clomid. With timed intercourse I conceived on the second cycle with Dr. Pereira. We started step by step and little by little, from a natural conception/cycle, then taking medication (Clomid), after that and HSG procedure, then surgery to see inside my body possible infertility problems, in my case, I had Endometriosis, the we IUI (4 rounds), and finally I got pregnant.   At the very beginning I had a laparoscopic procedure to check if the uterus & the tubes were fine.  I was diagnosed with endometriosis and some were removed from my uterus. But it was sneaking through my right tube to the rectum. Then he suggested to do a cycle before removing the infected tube and the rectum endometriosis. I had a successful cycle with two eggs since am also having a very low AMH. I had an egg retrieval and embryo freezing. Then i had another procedure to remove the right side tube and the endometriosis on my rectum. After that i had a hormonal cycle using estrogen patches and lupron to minimize the effect of the remaining microscopic pelvic endometriosis getting ready for the embryo transfer. Lastly i had a successful transfer with 1 embryo. After that (estrogen patches and progesterone injections until present).Dr. Pereira tracked my cycle through blood tests and ultrasounds. I had a hysteroscopy to remove my uterine fibroid. Letrozole 5-7days a month to induce ovulation and a trigger shot prior to IUI to release the egg. Diagnosis followed by natural conception based on his recommendation of the timing for intercourse. Dr. Spandorfer recommended eSET but after a few failed transfers he supported our decision to transfer two embryos.My husband was previously divorced with two children from previous marriage.  Dr Schattman felt that at my age of 36 we have time to conceive again.  He felt divorce rates are significant when twins are present and was clear in stating he wants a healthy baby, healthy environment and healthy marriage for us,  which how could one argue with that philosophy.  Dr. Reichman recommended single embryo transfers.Age based recommendations consistent with guidelines. Willing to to transfer 2 in age &lt;35 after long conversation Very important to do just one. He is highly against multiples at least for my case. I already have one child through natural child birth. Due to my many failed pregnancies, we transferred 3 embryos during a fresh transfer.Our twin birth was the very best thing that could have happened in our family. It was the ideal outcome. I do worry that our children are part of a specific trend, from a specific time in history, and that may negatively impact them in some way that I cannot yet predict. Because we did PGS testing, Dr. Reichman strongly encouraged the transfer of one embryo at a time.Due to my age, he only recommends one. We discussed all the pros and cons of single or multiple embryo transfers and she made sure we had all our questions answered and help us make informed decisionsSince my ovarian reserve was low, everything was about getting a few really quality eggs and then using them wisely.  We were preparing to do a frozen embryo transfer but my uterine lining was thin as we were getting closer to the transfer date.  Together with Dr. Pereira, we made the decision to skip the cycle in an effort to not waste a good embryo, adjust protocol for my next cycle and then transfer.Initially, we discussed pros cons of transferring single vs multiple embryos and i decided to only transfer one embryo. However, when the day 5 came and showed i had two blastocysts, Dr S said the best chance at pregnancy (or delivering a baby, I’m not sure which outcome we discussed- maybe it was both) would be to transfer both embryos, and I went with transferring both after weighing the pros and cons.  Dr.Reichman advocated a single embryo transfer for myself I believe partly because of my age. I'm not sure how he deals with this with other patients but this is definitely something to discuss with him in the beginning stages of the processI used a donor egg and due to her young age she had great results with good quality embryos so Dr Reichman advised on a single embryo transfer. Also due to my age and health risks involved. If I had been younger or the embryos of poorer quality he would have considered transferring two embryos. This was all discussed with me and agreed upon. Dr. Pereira recommended single embryo transfer for PGT embryos.He was very committed to eSET and was concerned about the risks associated with multiples pregnancy.I have not done the transfer yet but he suggested a single embryo transfer whereas i want multiple embryo. He said it is entirely up to him Dr. Reichman prefers to do single embryo transfers if you elect to do PGS testing. At first I was hesitant because I just wanted to be pregnant, but in hindsight this approach is for the best. We talked through the risks of a twin pregnancy and I am very thankful to Dr. Reichman to be currently pregnant with just one healthy baby. Dr. Reichman was a big proponent of only transferring a single embryo after PGS testing.  He explained the risks of transferring multiple embryos and together we decided to only transfer one at a time.For my age, the prefers to do multiple which is what we wanted to do going into this We didn't have a choice in our first transfer because only on egg made it to day 5. Dr. Kang recommend transferring 3 embroys for our second transfer. This was due to my age and underlying health conditions. It gave us the best possible chance and ended up in the birth of our son.  We froze embryos.With a pgs embryo transfer, Dr Davis would not risk a multiple pregnancy and I did not want that.multiple embryo transfer- we transferred 2 after many failed attempts and have twins!He was more open to multiples than I was but didn’t push them or really even recommend them to meTransfer many embryo Dr Rosenwaks transferred the current amount of embryos that would take and produce a liable pregnancy. N/aHe explained the risks and rewards of each for a woman my age. His funny warning was with sending up 2 embryos, you can't return them if you get twins! haha!Dr. P will do single or multiple depending on factors but we did not do IVF with him in the end.I was planning to transfer two embryos. But the doctor advised me to transfer only one because of the endometriosis. He was very right about it.From the beginning of our fertility ""journey"" my husband and I have been pretty committed to the idea of doing a single embryo transfer with PGS. Dr Reichman supported this idea. I never inquired about transferring more than one embryo at a time. After two failed cycles I wanted to transfer two 5 day blastocyst but Dr. Pereira suggested we should just transfer one and we did the same. He really determines that based on how many children you want to have and how the process is going once the embryos start growing. He is not opposed to multiple embryo transfer. We wanted to avoid the risk of multiple pregnancy and this was discussed with him. Dr. Reichman knew from the start that I only wanted one additional child. So it was never a question if we would implant more than one.N/aeSET made absolute sense for my situation and his rationale behind it was completely correct. Dr. Elias explained that due to a number of factors including advanced maternal age as well as other medical issues I would be prudent to only transfer one embryo for not only a positive outcome for pregnancy but to my long term health. Thought it was smart and strategic that we transferred one, given my age, the number of viable embryos we had, and the potential risks posed with multiples. Dr Melnick did not suggest multiple embryo transfers given that mine had been through PGSI haven’t yet done IVF but in consultation about it, i was told that it would depend on embryo quality. N/aHe will never implant more than one embryo at a time. Or at leas that is what he said. He is extremely conservative. I haven’t really gotten to a conversation with her about this yet. She said that it’s most efficient for the clinic to fertilize all of the eggs that are extracted and freeze extras - but we didn’t talk about how many would be transferred.N/A - have not discussed since we are only doing IUI so far.Yes, he recommended 1 and I think that was the VERY best decision. I have had severe morning sickness and I can't imagine if I was carrying twins. Yes, he called me the day of the transfer and asked we reconsider transferring only one. We did.I have not had a transfer yet, but in my case Dr Melnick said she would only consider transferring two embryos at day three and that she would not consider transferring more than one at day 5.Since the embryos were genetically tested, we only did a single embryo transfer.Dr. Schattman allowed us to decide whether to transfer 1 vs. 2 embryos--he gave us the pros and cons and I appreciate that he gave us all the information we needed to make the decision. He was very realistic about our chances with 1,2, 3 embryos. He always made the decision to transfer 3 because of poor quality. We had the conversation that we would reduce if we had a triplet pregnancy. We could have also chosen to put in fewer embryos. Dr. Reichman suggested 1 embryo, frozen, non medicated transfer.Did not do this.No strong preference but based on my age and specific condition the recommendation was 3-4 embryos.I believe Dr. Reichman is pro eSET. Dr. Spandorfer left it entirely up to us how many embryos we would transfer, but we never considered more than 1 at a time. He pushed eSET for us since I am under 35, but after our first failed transfer he had no issues with us moving to 2 embryo transfers. He warned us of high risk pregnancies with multiple embryos.This has not yet been discussed because we are trying IUI first Based on our discussions and the fact that we are doing PGS testing, the current recommendation is to transfer one embryo.She was open to what we wanted and supported our decision to transfer two.We transferred 2 or 3 embryos each time. That was what I had anyone, so there was nothing to freeze.Based on embryo quality and my medical history, she transferred 3 embryos each cycle.  I felt this approach was appropriate.  He said that at my age (41 at the time) more embryos transferred was best and would increase my chances of getting pregnant. He did not recommend PGD, possibly because I didn’t have enough eggs to do that.She was hesitant about transferring multiple embryos due to the higher risk for multiple babies. We wanted to transfer 2 and she agreed knowing our history ofblosses. She made sure to explain all the risks and such but she was open to what we wanted. Due to my age, 41, and the fact that we didn't do PGS, Dr Reichman recommended transferring all 3 of the day 3 embryos we retrieved and fertilized. We never got enough for this to be an issue.  But I would never have transferred more than 2.Due to age and strength of embryos Dr reichman suggested an esetDoctors in general seem to view success as a single embryo transfer that results in a pregnancy due to the risks associated with being pregnant with multiples.None yet but from what I feel we will do a multiple fresh embryo transfer. My doctor recommended transferring two embryos because of both male and female infertility factors.Dr. Kang advised just one embryo at a time for me due to the percentages and risks associated with multiples. I trust in Dr. Kang's professional advice.He was only willing to put in 1 embryo as my age is young and it was our first transfer.Dr. Reichman did a single embryo transfer because I had a good quality 5 day blast. He was concerned about multiples as i have lupus. He was conservative but mindfulWe preformed multiple embryo transfer and it was earlier than expected.Dr Pereria encouraged me to do a fresh transfer of two 3 day embryos. He said the embryos help each other implant and since we had no genetic issues we should do a day 3 transfer vs day 5 because egg do better in the womb. It worked for us. He listened to my fears and hopes and what was happening to my body and we decided together. There was not a one size fits all rule that was just applied to me. Strongly preferred a single embryo due to risks for advanced maternal age and maternal / baby healthWe used IUIWe had twins , which we were more than happy to have,  if you don’t mind twins, We positively accept itWe did single transfer when it was off tested We decided to only transfer 1 embryo at a time - because we wanted the highest probability of success with our procedure the first time around.  And we are glad that our procedure worked in our favor.Since I had 1 PGS normal out of 3 embryos during that first cycle, we decided to transfer 3 embryos. This is also the clinics recommendation for non-tested embryos at my age I am glad we did single embryo transfer.Dr. Pereira preferred one embryo transfer but the week after retrieval we played it by ear and he gave us the choice of a day three or day five transfer. We do not have any comments. I got pregnant with a single embryo but in our case, I don't think that multiple embryos/pregnancy would have been a problem. Dr Reichman recommended transfering only one embryo, which we were completely aligned with.Dr. Reichman was adamant on single embryo transfer with me, citing my age and body type (slim/petite).Weill Cornell Reproductive team has a sheet where you can put it who many embryos to transfer. The recommend embryo transfer for my age was only 1 but my second transfer since the embryos are in the morula stage, Dr. Schattman decided two embryos transfer but it also failed. Dr. Davis was a strong proponent of fresh day 3 transfers, and one time we transferred 4 of them, which made me pretty nervous. He felt that embryos had a better chance of success in a woman's body than in a petri dish. I ultimately had success with a fresh day 3 transfer with another doctor.From my experience, I believe Dr. Reichman prefers single embryo transfer.For my first transfer, we transferred two embryos.  The doctor gave me the choice if I wanted to transfer 1 or 2 embryos.  He and the doctor performing the embryo transfer explained that there was an increased chance of twins by transferring 2 embryos.Dr. Rosenwaks highly prefers single embryo transfer for day 5 blastocysts for women under the age of 35.  I already planned on transferring one so he didn’t have to do any convincing or education on the importance of transferring one. Due to my age and embryo quality we decided to do a single embryo transfer, which was successful the first time. Dr. Reichman strongly recommended we only transfer one embryo, given that this was a fresh transfer and a multiple gestation would increase the risk of OHSS.We were using PGS tested embryos - so single is the only way to go. Twins would have increased the chance of harm to me or the babies. Given the quality of our embryo, we never even discussed using multiple embryos. Dr Pereira recommended transferring just one embryo due to my age, body size, and genetically normal embryo.Dr Rosenwaks is very direct that he only does eSET and does not do multiple embryo transfer due to the additional risks that it presents.Dr Reichman suggested a single embryo transfer for us and we were in agreement! I think he evaluates each patient individually to see what makes the most sense for each.Generally I think he prefers single embryo transfers, at least in younger patients. Other than that, we never had more than one so that wasn’t really applicable or discussed. I think Cornell does up to 2 for day 5 and 3-4 for day 3 (not 100% sure)Dr. Elias strongly recommended SET due to my age even after my fresh cycle ended in a CP.  I did not have strong preferences on the number of embryo transferred, and took his recommendations which were based on age and prior transfer history for me.
Dr. Chung was always direct in telling me his concerns regarding pregnancy of multiples  He gave me all of the statistics, but when push came to shove, he allowed me to put in two, even though he objected to it.  I initially asked Dr. Reichman for a multiple embryo transfer, I thought it would be fun to have twins, he explained the risks involved and as we were doing PGS testing on the embryos the chances of success of one implanting were higherI'm young (28) and when I started IVF with him I was 25, he insists of not putting a lot of embryo at the same time; he prefer to put one, or maximum two. For our scenario Dr. Pereira recommended a single egg transfer and to freeze the remaining embryos. Dr. Pereira decided this based on my health, our discussions about our future family plans, and to help minimize any risk.I felt very comfortable just transferring one embryo.Dr. Pfeifer cares so much for her patients that she overall preferred to transfer single embryos. We spoke several times about risks with multiples and weighed the options very carefully before putting my 2 embryos back. Our doctor suggested multiple embryo transfer to increase a chance of pregnancy thought he talked to us about a chance of getting twins and its risks.Dr. Goldschlag recommended to transfer one embryo if it made it to Day 5 and two embryos if we made it to Day 3 and given my age at the time.He preferred only one or two embryos at a time. Cornell itself gives a sheet on how many embryos to transfer based on age and if you're doing fresh or frozen.He preferred to transfer a single embryo for us, but we never had one to transfer.Dr. Reichman strongly advised a single embryo transfer given my age. I agreed with him.Dr. Pfeifer is very smart about it.  She prefers to transfer just one, but will allow 2 if you really want. She moreso bases it on age and circumstances. I'm under 35 so I only transfer 1. At 35, 2 would be okay.  I'm not sure, but I believe she does not recommend more than 2. Dr. Reichman strongly encouraged elective single embryo transfer. I was happy with this approach.Dr Elias said with my age, 42, he recommended day 3 transfer of 3-4 embryos to give me the best chance of pregnancy (embryos do better back in the body) and PGS testing on remaining embryos to freeze. For a 40 year old woman, she would recommend transferring up to 4 embryos for a fresh day 3 transfer (untested), up to 2 on a day 5 fresh transfer (untested), and 1 PGS-tested normal embryo for a frozen transfer.Because I have never been pregnant before, my hormones levels and reserve was good, my doctor suggested to transfer 1 embryo at a time.  Looking back, I would have transferred 2 (because that is all I had at the time).  I ended doing a fresh transfer with 3 embryos in my 2nd IVF cycle.  She counseled me on risk of multiples and recommended transferring one embryo based on my age and history. We agreed.He felt that multiple embryos was a good strategy for my first transfer as it increased the odds of success. However, after I failed to conceive, I requested that I not ""waste"" 2 embryos each time and would prefer to only transfer a single. He was completely open to that and subsequent transfers (2x) were successful.He strongly encouraged us to only transfer one due to our age, and embryo. I was fine with this!Both time Dr. Elias opted to transfer 3.  I took his advice both times.I He had a strong preference for 1 until our 5 or so cycle, at which time he said we should give it a try, given how much money and time and energy we have poured into. I understand his rationale for 1. 2 is much more complex and dangerous. We transferred 1 2 times, and 2 twice. I transferred 2 embryos. I don’t know what his policy is for other patients. I had done multiple transfers as recommended by my doctor since considering my age the chance of having multiples is pretty low. Due to my age less than 35 one embryo was transferred. One embryo took and resulted in single healthy pregnancy. Unless you are older or have several failed attempts I believe one is the best number. I know Dr Rosenwaks much prefers a single transfer as he feels that is safest for baby and mom. I pleaded for multiple and he was adamant for a single, and fortunately for me it worked out.Given my age, Owen Davis was willing to transfer as many as 8 3 day embryos.  He had had success in the past doing this.  I was willing to go ahead as well.  We implanted 3 of the embryos we retrieved an fertilized.  Because of my size and my weight, Dr. G strongly encouraged the transfer of single embryos only. He was concerned about potential risks of a pregnancy with multiples [as was I!]We opted to transfer one embryo as we were very concerned about having twins. We may eventually try two in our frozen transfers, but wanted to be conservative initially.Depends on your age. We would have liked to transfer 2, but I only have 1 viable to transfer on Day 3.We decided to transfer one embryo. Dr. kligman was respective of decision. In our case, she would have liked to have performed a day 5 transfer in March (IVF cycle #2), but wanted to wait and make the final decision once she saw what the embryos looked like on day 3. In the end, she ended up transferring two moderate quality embryos not knowing if the other six, slower developing embryos, would make it to Day 5. Only 1 of 6 was of good enough quality to freeze, so in hindsight was the right decision. Those two failed to implant, but we did an FET with our day 5 frozen embryo in June and that proved to be the lucky one!He much prefers eSET unless good reason for more- which I agree with. That said he's not one size fits all and will give you a reco with rationale rooted in your personal situation which I like.He wants you to have a healthy baby.  We came up with a plan together on how to proceed.It has been my experience that Dr. Kligman will recommend eSET in all cases other than when it is not the patient's desire or when eSET is not producing results.  He will always go over the statistics and recommendations with us pre-transfer to help us make an informed choice.  In my first consultation with Dr. Davis, I expressed to him that I wanted to transfer just 1 embryo if possible. He noted my wishes and said that realistically he could transfer either 1 or 2, but it depended on the embryos themselves: how many were fertilized, and how they looked on day 3 post-fertilization. This made sense, and post retrieval he and my nurse Katie kept me aware of how they were doing and how likely a day 5 transfer would be. Happily, 5 embryos made it to day 3 and looked good enough to wait until day 5 for a single embryo transfer.I always transfered two embroys. While some doctors would have advoses me to transfer more than one he made sure I understood the potential risk of twins. My husband and I really did not want to increase the chances for twins so we decided to go with one embryo. He strongly advised us to transfer two. He said that it could result in twins, singlet, or nothing, and that the only reason he wouldn't recommend this is if we were trying to avoid multiples. I felt that I was ""told"" how many embryos were being transferred, as opposed to having the option to disagree. This was my biggest issue with Weill Cornell.Dr Davis was fine with transferring 5 embryos without PGS testing.
Once PGS tested, he recommended eSET.
I thought this was appropriate based on my age group.Cornell recommended 3-4 eggs for my age group.Dr Pfeifer was very clear,because of my age, she would like to transfer a single embryo only. We agreed with this approach and are happy with the resultwe put back in all 4 embryos every time. I wish maybe we tried to freeze a couple but I did what he suggested as he felt it upped the odds of success.He educated us about risks of twins. He preferred singleton for us.Because of my history, age, low AMH, we transferred all 4 embryos (per doctors suggestion)My doctor stuck with the recommendation for my age which was 4 since I only had 4 anyway. She was hoping I'd have more than 4 so I could freeze some embyros. I have a feeling she may have transferred more if I had them and I consented since she really wanted this to work for me. They deferred to our preference. We had a different doctor for the transfer I think his name was Dr. Cho . I was in the surgery room and he said something like, ""Did Dr. Spandorfer talk to you about transferring one or two embryos?""  He hadn't and then Dr. Cho sort of talked us out of our preference for a single embryo transfer even though we absolutely positively did not want to have twins and felt very strongly about single embryo transfer .He advised me on the risk of multiples, but allowed me to make the decision on how many embryos to transfer.He was definitely in favor of eSET because of potential complications with carrying multiples. However, he was much more open to transferring two blasts when the first 2 eSET failed. No experience/no comment on this - I only had a single to transfer. He definitely prefers SET but pays attention the quality and my agewe did multiples.He prefers to transfer oneBased on my age we used multiple embryo transfer All of mine where single embryo transfers. FET were with PGS tested embryos he doesn’t recommend more than 1 w PGS.N/aDr recommend me to transfer all of my 3 embryo on day 3. He said even with all 3, the chances are very low.  So he didn't recommend me do the PGS testing. He thinks maybe embryo have better chance inside the body.With PGS he recommended oneI transferred 4 embryos, which is shocking for most people. Physicians are not required to take calculus or any real math classes to get into med school or during med school. I did take advanced calc, probability and statistics.  I calculated out the odds assuming each individual egg has a 15% chance of getting pregnant and even with 4 eggs, the odds are still under 50%. If you are over 40, don't waste time thinking you are going to have multiples cause statistically that's not going to happen.    Had a traumatic experience and would not transfer multiple embryos ever again - I know i was a true exception, but my recommendation is for people to be more conservative and save unnecessary complicated pregnanciesSince we were doing genetic testing and knew that we had genetically sound embryos prior to transferring, there was no incentive/logic to transferring multiple embryos. My understanding is that this is only done during a fresh transfer when embryos have not been genetically tested. In general, Dr. Reichman has preference for a single embryo transfer especially when embryos were tested. He does take into account individual circumstances and changes the approach accordingly.Dr Pereira felt strongly that I should only have 1 embryo transferred due to my history with miscarriages and wanting to mitigate risk. This was in line with what my husband and I wanted to do also.We absolutely felt educated on the trade offs between single and multiple embryo transfers. As our issue was not getting pregnant but staying pregnant we began by single only. Our successful pregnancy was our first multiple transfer that resulted in our daughter.In Dr. Reichman's opinion, I didn't need multiple embryo transfer.  I'm glad he chose the approach that he did.  It was perfect for my individual situation.  May not work for every patient but it worked for me and that's all that matters. Yes, Dr. Reichman strongly recommended a transfer of a single embryo and explained the risks of multiple embryo transfer to my health and the embryo's chances of survival. I completely trusted his judgment and rationale. I appreciated that he is mission-driven and practices extreme caution. He wants to be able to deliver a healthy (as safe as possible) pregnancy, not a risky one.He informed us of the benefits/risks and left the final decision up to us.I am under 35 so Dr. Reichman recommended a single transfer. We didn't even consider two... ",8.800000000000027,8.40000000000005,"I had two unsuccessful IUIs before moving on to IVF. I don't know that protocol Dr. Schattman used but he started me with Estrogen patches (after a positive ovulation using ovulation predictor kit) changing it every 2 days, till the 4th patch and getting my period. One IVF cycle with estrogen priming and high doses of Follistim and Menopur, canceled due to nonresponse. Followed the transfer with progesterone inserts. He didn't push me to get other tests done right away (other than genetic screening) as he could sense I was hesitant, but after my husband decided to get a SA and it came back with a lower than average count, he recommended IUI to improve our chances of success. After the first round of Clomid didn't result in pregnancy, he recommended an HSG to make sure we weren't facing any additional obstacles, and he also recommended back to back IUIs for the 2nd round of Clomid. After that the plan was to do 3 more IUIs, but we never did the third one because at that point I'd had negative reactions to both clomid and letrozole. 33 eggs retrieved, many (I think 23) embryos produced using ICSI, one transferred, and 7 of good enough quality to freeze at day 5 or 6.When we first started together I had already been diagnosed with PCOS. Dr. Goldschlag gave me the option of miscarrying naturally and we proceeded with a second IVF cycle in September 2018 that resulted in a negative pregnancy test.300 Gonal F, 150 menopur, Cetrotide. During monitoring for the 2nd IUI, Dr. Reichman noticed on the ultrasound that I had a potential mild hydrosalpinx, which had not shown clearly on the HSG I had done. 1 ivf with estrogen prime, menopur, gonal-f, cetrotide - produced 9 eggs, 4 fertilized, day 3 fresh transfer of 3 embryos (bfn) and the other 2 embryos didn’t make it to feeeze. For our fresh transfer of 1 embryo, we were not successful. This is larger than it needed to be to move to the trigger shot. She felt that my first cycle was too long. Dr Davis took the time to see what was best for my body as opposed to some cookie cutter protocol. Estrogen patch

2nd IVF Cycle 
4 eggs retrieved, 4 fertilized with ICSI, 4 transferred on day 3 (14 cell, 10 cell & (2) 8 cell). I only had 4 embryos make it to day 3 so didn't have options of testing/sexing them. We did 3 retrievals with pgs and icsi, one natural frozen transfer and one medicated frozen transfer, all under Dr. Reichman’s direction Within minutes of my first sonogram, he noticed I had a uterine septum--something 3 obgyns and 1 other fertility doctor had missed.

2 embryo transfer to increased the chance of success Ivf with ICSI and PGDHigh gonal F; we did 5 rounds. ICSI identified for next cycle due to MFII have been through so many IVF cycles that is hard to remember what he did. He was very committed to eSET and was concerned about the risks associated with multiples pregnancy. I have not done the transfer yet but he suggested a single embryo transfer whereas i want multiple embryo. P will do single or multiple depending on factors but we did not do IVF with him in the end. Schattman allowed us to decide whether to transfer 1 vs. 2 embryos--he gave us the pros and cons and I appreciate that he gave us all the information we needed to make the decision. Due to my age, 41, and the fact that we didn't do PGS, Dr Reichman recommended transferring all 3 of the day 3 embryos we retrieved and fertilized. Dr Rosenwaks is very direct that he only does eSET and does not do multiple embryo transfer due to the additional risks that it presents. In my first consultation with Dr. Davis, I expressed to him that I wanted to transfer just 1 embryo if possible."

The majority of the services I received were covered by insurance. 15k per cycledr. davis does not accept insurance for consultations and ultrasounds. it's important to know that after you have the consultation, if your insurance covers fertility treatment then your treatment will be billed under weil-cornell, not dr. davis - so the only thing you might have to pay out of pocket for is dr. davisIUI's were covered by insurance so we only paid copayMost was covered by my insurance - just had to pay deductible and co-pays.over $10,000. We are currently working through what the future holds. Our insurance currently covers 80/20 but we have paid thousands out of pocket. One round of IVF was around 11k. Meds were about 4.5kI have 0 fertility insurance Each IVF cycle with the genetic testing costs around 25k , medications includedCovered by insurance Covered by insurance.  Just paid copaysThe cost was not outrageous. It was comparable to most egg freezing clinics. Also, I feel safe with my eggs stored there.My insurance did not cover the cost of treatment, so we had to pay out of pocket.  With 3 IUI and 1 IVF, the out of pocket cost was approximately $40,000.  The office was upfront and clear about costs.Significant out of pocket costs. I had a $10k max from my insurance and i wxceeded that.  Please see my other comment, i will repeat here:

I pay my bills regularly every month in full, and have excellenr credit and money saved to ensure my bills are paid.  I was sent to a collection agency not once but TWICE for not paying my bill THAT I NEVER RECEIEVED.  This was quite frustrating especially when in process of buying house/cars and it potentially affecting credit scores.  

Also - 8 months after my failed IVF - i reveived a $3,000 check in the mail from Weill Cornell with no explanation. I assume i overpayed my services/benefits during my IVF (i must have spent $7k out of pocket) and this was reimbursement (so many months later).  The billing explanations is quite confusing and stressful all at once and I know its not the fault of Dr S....but collection agency?!??! Come on.  So far I've spend just under $70K on 8 rounds (with minimal amounts covered on my health care due to my age)I had good insurance coverage. I believe I spent apx $4k on copays for 2 retrievals, 3 transfers, and testing (including diagnostic surgery).  My main costs were associated with medications and elective PGS testing. I had insurance coverage at 100% as long as I stayed within the center of excellence. Dr. Pereira was in the center of excellence. My medication total came out to about $75 out of pocket for the egg retrieval. I also was responsible for $25 office visit copay. I would think the total was around $3K out of pocket.  My insurance covered the injectible medications and most of the monitoring appointments. It did not cover PGS testing or freezing of the embryos. I don’t recall the entire cost as some was covered by insurance and some was out of pocket.  As we all know, it is expensive. My insurance covers most testing and the IUI. I've paid $30 copays for some visits and for some of the drugs. I think I also paid for the trigger shot. That's the one thing I don't remember too well! The over charge and do not have professional billing staff. So far, I think we have spent around $25kPayments were required for the monitoring, egg retrieval, hospital fee for egg retrieval, ICSI, and transfers.  My insurance covered up to a certain amount and thereafter for the procedures the clinic required full payment in advance.An IVF treatment, retrieval and transfer (sans medication) cost approximately $18,000It was all out of pocket. For two cycles and two transfers (so far) it has cost about $40,000 I dontknow Insurance covered 100% of my two IUS. Tiny lab co-pays (eg $20). My only out of pocket expense was the Sperm itself and shipping it. My insurance covered the cost.Around $2000We've only done IUI's and our largest costs were on fertility medications.They took insurance It was about $10k with our first son but then insurance covered more so our twins were about $5k but that was 15 & 20 years ago.
You can’t put a price tag in the miracle of a child .... you just can’t.  10500 IVF  2000 icsi $45 co pay per visit$35 dollar with my insurance $15k per cycleI am probably one of the lucky few, where my insurance covered the bill. I just needed to pay an annual deductible of $200 and a $30 copay + $20 lab copay for each visit. Visits do add up though when you're coming in 2 -3 times a week for monitoring, but affordable considering what it could have been without coverage. I can't remember specific costs, but I do remember that Dr. Pereira was very considerate with billing when my insurance wasn't the best.Everything was not covered by my terrible insurance so it was out of pocket. He was very good at keeping procedures or ordering medicine only as necessary.My insurance covered the majority of the costs. 2 IUIs, 2 IVFs, 1 embryo transfer Total was between $40 to 50KstandardLuckily insurance covers some of my treatment, but the billing process is transparent. We paid largely out of pocket. For consults, 2 retrievals with PGS and ICSI, one transfer, etc I believe we paid about 45k. Cost was always made clear to us in advance and there were no surprises. Cost for the first IUI was $800. All medications up to and throughout the first are you why were approximately $200.I have great insurance so I only had to pay lab fees and co pays when pregnant. IVF was not included in our insurance plan so it was around for one cycle $15k + medicines with copay. I left my prior job and am currently paying for COBRA because the fertility benefits were better than my new job (non-existent!)  

IUI was $735 including male and female components.20k for each IVF cycle We were fortunate to have amazing insurance that covered most costs. It is very infrequent but we had unlimited lifetime fertility benefits. We did, however, have to pay out of pocket for the genetic testing of the embryos.My insurance through my employer offered a lifetime fertility maximum of $25,000, which only covered my first two rounds of IVF. So after those were unsuccessful, I paid out of pocket for my third and eventually successful IVF round, which came to about $25,000 which included the transfer costs. Cornell was very upfront about the costs prior to my out-of-pocket cycle and always available to answer any of my billing questions.400/ ultrasound 
I think it was $2000 for the iui Cost was as expected for fertility treatment in this area.  Unfortunately (specific to my situation) while Dr. Elias and monitoring at the Westchester office was covered by my insurance, Weill Cornell in Manhattan was not so I had to pay out of pocket for all IVF related treatments. Expensive but what I had not spent was promptly refunded when I had to cancel my egg retrieval.Dr. Elias does not accept my insurance plan so I was a self-pay patient. My plan does have out-of-network benefits, however, I was told that I had to pay upfront and then get a form that I could submit to my insurance for reimbursement. IUIs cost about $400 with our insurance, not sure about the actual cost. Our insurance didn’t pay for ivf, so we paid out of pocket. We did ICSI, genetic testing on the embryos, and a frozen transfer. Including the cost of meds, anesthesia for the retrieval, and the aforementioned choices, we spent about $25K on IVF.Insurance covered but roughly $20,000.  Dr Melnick takes Aetna but the Hospital sadly does notIUI was apx $5K per attempt, including monitoring.My insurance covered everything except for my copays. No insurance coverage unfortunately.  IVF Cycle Fee $9463, ICSI $2630, Freezing $1050, PGS $4850, Medication $4500, Hospital Fee $1000So far insurance has covered all of my procedures, and I’ve needed to pay a copay for each visit. I paid a copay, which I knew I had to. I paid a copay every time I saw Dr. Pereira because with my insurance, he is considered a specialist. I found Dr. Pereira because he was in network with my insurance, so besides copays, I paid nothing out of pocket. As for medications, I had one expensive medication, but I didn't have to take it every month, it was more of a one time prescription. All costs were paid by my insurance except some medication and copays. I paid for Clomid, Sperm wash, and IUI through insurance. 25k+ for IVF before medication, IUI 1.4k and trigger shots $100 if not covered by insurance.  normal co-pay for ultrasounds, price depends on your insurance. my insurance didnt cover IUI, so we paid $750 out of pocket every time. Also HSG was around $250 that we paid out of pocket, but depends on your insurance and fertility benefits. 4 rounds of IUI/ 1 cycle of IVF including genetic testing came out to be about $50k. I have Cigna and all of my procedures and appointments were 100% covered, except for genetic testing (that was around $350 - they have a deal worked out not to exceed that if your insurance doesn't cover), so I mostly just had a specialist co-pay each visit of $40. Since there are a lot of monitoring appointments, all in I'd say I was spending $200-250 a month on co-pays or so. I now am out-of-pocket that I’m starting the process for IVF and I just paid $600 for my sounding. The IUI procedures along with all the bloodwork and ultrasounds were paid by insurance and I saw some very bizarre negotiations between the clinic and the insurance so I don’t have straight numbers for them. All of my medications needed pre-authorization and I would pay out of pocket mainly due to timing for Clomid, which is quite inexpensive. Our insurance has a $30K lifetime max for infertility treatment so I've been tracking costs of everything really carefully.  Would recommend putting it in a spreadsheet right away because there will be A LOT of insurance claims and it can get very confusing.  Here's how it breaks down thus far (total for both husband & myself):
o Diagnosis (physician consult, bloodwork/ultrasound, semen analysis & HSG test) = Billed charges ~$5,700; after discounts our insurance paid ~ $3,200; our cost sharing (deductible & coinsurance) ~ $900.
o Genetic Testing (through Mt. Sinai Genomics/Sema4) = Billed charges ~$20,500; after discounts our insurance paid ~ $1,400; our cost sharing ~ $500
** I think the billing staff at CRM said if the genetic testing was not covered by insurance it would only cost a few hundred dollars each, so was completely shocked by the enormous amount billed to our insurance.  Wish they would have told us about that in advance (and fortunately our insurance confirmed genetic testing would not go toward our $30K lifetime maximum).**
o IUI cycle #1 (medical) = Billed charges ~$4,600; after discounts our insurance paid ~ $3,300; our cost sharing ~ $300; 
o IUI cycle #1 (Rx-clomid & ovidrel) =  after discounts our insurance paid ~ $70; our cost sharing ~ $130
o IUI cycle #2 (medical-estimate) = Billed charges ~$4,700; after discounts our insurance paid ~ $3,500; our cost sharing ~ $400; 
o IUI cycle #2 (Rx-letrozole & ovidrel) =  after discounts our insurance paid ~ $50; our cost sharing ~ $120I remember the co-pays were $50. The surgery was expensive because it was only partially covered by insurance. It was worth every penny.My insurance covered everything with the exception of a small co pay.I had pretty amazing fertility benefit, so had to just pay my co-pay ($15 / visit), which did add up because I ended up going 10-12 times / month for 6+ months. All of my husband's sperm exams and washing for IUI were out of pocket, so we had to pay around $200-$300 for each cycle. There were some tests that weren't covered that we had to pay out of pocket, but don't think we spent more than $3-$4K for the entire process.My insurance covered most of the costs of my care. The IUI was paid for 100%. In total for all office visits and my HSG procedure, we paid about $3000 out of pocketMy insurance with Cigna only covered $10,000 max for IVF and I paid close to $15,000 out of pocket Ongoing, but so far about $2,000We had insurance for some, it was not cheap either way. IVF medications- Approximately $6,000
IVF cycle- Approximately $15,000It was about $1,200 per IUI. My insurance should have covered my doctor visits and ultrasounds, but they took it out of my deductible.
It was covered by insurance.Egg Retrieval Cycle ~8K
Medications ~ 1.7 K ( was able to reduce by using unused, remaining meds from friends)
Hospital admitting fee ~ 1 K
Anesthesia $750
Total cost ~11.5kOne of the more expensive places in NYC.  Owen Davis charges for clomid monitoring, which seems semi-insane.  Around 1250 / IUIHe was out of pocket. So expensiveThe costs you are responsible for really depend on your insurance.  I had to cover cost of sperm washing for IUI, which was $375.  Other then that it was just co-pays.   The coordinator was very helpful in informing me what is covered.  And, if it is not covered giving me alternatives labs to use for some tests that are not covered.My insurance covers all infertility treatments, except IVF, so luckily everything up to now has been covered. My only costs are my regular copay for office visits and medication.My husband and I had recently moved and were waiting for our new insurance to kick in during our cycle with Dr. Reichman, so we paid entirely out of pocket.  Our costs were about $5500.  This included our initial consultation and baseline ultrasound, required blood work for myself and my husband (Hep B/C, HIV, mumps, etc.), three monitoring ultrasounds, the IUI, two pregnancy blood tests, and five OB ultrasounds.  Because we were paying out of pocket, Dr. Reichman charged us a reduced rate for everything outside of lab costs.  Should be around $10,000It is very expensive and insurances usually do not cover fertility associated treatmentsWe paid out of pocket for this cycle--as we had maxed out our insurance allowance of 25K. The medication was around 5K plus another 13K for the IVF cycle (including monitoring, hospital fees, ICSI, embryo freezing). For our frozen transfer, we spent another 4K for the actual monitoring, medication plus an ERA which Dr. Schattman wanted us to do before the transfer. IUI was covered under insurance but ivf fresh cycle ranged from $10-12,000. Additionals would be icsi ($2,500) or assisted egg hatching ($1,800), also PGS testing varied ($3,000-8,000)Davis doesn't take insurance so I had to pay for everything out of pocket and then hope to be reimbursed by my insurance company.  
I think our out of pocket costs were in the tens of thousands...  lost count. Luckily all of our IUI's were covered by my insurance. We did not proceed with IVF due to the issues we encountered, so we don't know what that would have cost us out of pocket. Medications, ultrasound, bloodwork. Most was covered by insurance. My insurance does not cover my treatment, so  I will be responsible to the bill.  Blood work and regular visits are covered.  I will be responsible to pay between $11000-$15000Consults with Dr. Davis are $600 out of pocket. The uterian sounding is also $600 out of pocket. We had a follow up consult with him that he did not charge for, he also does not charge for phone calls.
All cycle costs were covered/ cost based on my insurance which provided some coverage of fertility treatmentThe treatment wad $30,000 out of pocket because insurance did not cover Dr. Reichman but I wanted to see him anyway because he was so good!Cornell accepted my insurance, but their 'center' did not. The center does everything for IVF and some IUI procedures. Very hard to understand. Made for some very confusing and expensive bills.$10,500 IVF base price + cost of medications ($10k, in my case)Approximately $20k for an IVF cycle not including PGS testing.Most of my treatments were medical (Asherman's Syndrome) and not ART and therefore covered by my insurance. Cornell happens to be covered but not in-network so I was paying higher co-pays, etc. Also we switched insurance mid-year and had to meet our deductible so I did end up paying several thousand dollars for my care (the hysteroscopies were about $500 each), but it was not unreasonable. I paid out of pocket for all expenses. $750 for consulation and ultrasound. $1000 for HSG. Awaiting a bill for bloodwork but expect it to be about $500. I had strong insurance coverage so was not aware of detailed costs. My IUIs were covered by insurance with only copays. My insurance did not cover IVF or any drugs involved with IVF. IVF + ICSI + fresh transfer + embryo storage + the hospital fee + sperm collection + all bloodwork/ultrasounds cost us approximately $15,000 (medications not included). Each frozen embryo transfer was approximately $4600 (medications not included).He does not accept any insuranceAbout $6000My insurance covered 3 IUI cycles. The rest I have paid out of pocket.I am just starting IVF but I think the cost for IVF with PGS testing and meds without insurance is around 25K; our insurance will cover 10K for treatment and 4K for meds.Only my co-pays for drugs.  My insurance covers iuis and the meds for iuis but not IVF.  We have not done IVF yet. The Dr's staff and the clinic were not initially clear on insurance process.  They fail to tell you that the Dr may accept your insurance but the clinic may not. Fortunately, my insurance covered the Dr consultation and blood work and my husband's insurance covers everything else, including the clinic costs and procedures done through Cornell/NY Presbyterian. Make sure you ask if the Dr and the clinic accept your insurance.I think each monitoring session was abut $40 and each IUI was about $70. The retrieval and transfer for IVF was about $12,000, the meds were covered by insurance (about $10,000) except for $750 that I paid out of pocket.My insurance covered most of my IUI appointments so I just had to pay co-pays.Because I was classified as infertile, almost all of my costs were covered by insurance. I purchased donor sperm myself. 100% covered by insurance Insurance covered most of my costs including my drugs.All was covered by insurance except for endometrial coculture ($1000) and the fetal ultrasounds ($400 per ultrasound).They take most insurances but mine only covered a few cycles. My primary insurance covered diagnostic tests and ART not including IVF. After 6 months of treatment, I got another insurance that covered IVF. Out of pocket I spent about $9,000 over the course of 1 year.I mistakenly paid out of pocket for two cycles which were actually covered by my insurance. This was later credited back to me after I spotted the error and complained. Insurance covered just over 1/2. IVF cost $10,000 out of pocket not including monitoring charges which added to an additional $1500 out of pocket.15 to 20k with pgs and icsi, partially covered by insurance. $14K upfront for TESE with a standby physician fee of $1-2K(?) if TESE was not performed. Paid a facility/anesthesiologist fee, which was refunded as we did not have the procedure. Infertility testing and IUI is covered by my insurance, with Weill Cornell accepts.  All money owed is because of deductibles/co-pays.Most of our costs were covered by insurance. We paid an initial visit cost of $40 and $5,000 for PGS.IUI Is $690 per cycle (including sperm wash) excluding sperm, sperm storage, labs, ultrasound and monitoring.  Not sure about other surgeries (to remove fibroids) /tests/consultations/ labs/ meds. We received a fee schedule for the procedures, but I wish we knew what the blood work, sonograms and monitoring cost. Most likely insurance will pay $0 but it's been a nightmare trying to get Cigna then Aetna and now Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield to confirm/deny what is even covered let alone the cost to us. Una helps us through all of this. My insurance paid for blood work and ultrasounds but not for IUIs and IVFs.I paid regular co-pay fees (maybe $20 each time?) but then everything was covered through my insurance.Dr. Davis does not accept insurance, so you must pay for all of his services (initial consultation $600?, hysteroscopy $5,000?, hsg ???, confirmation of pregnancy ultrasound $750??) in full before they are rendered.  Then the billing department is to send you paperwork to submit to insurance for reimbursement.  There were times when the billing department did not send the necessary forms, and when contacted acted put out by the request.  The clinic as a whole was participating in my insurance, so IVF and monitoring were all paid directly from insurance to the clinic and I did not have to pay out of pocket.  I believe IVF with ICSI and cryopreservation of embryos is approximately $16,000 per round plus medications.I think an unmedicated IUI including tv u/s was about $400.  IVF came out to somewhere between $20-40k depending on what we did.  I honestly don't recall the details.  A few cycles were covered by my insurance, the rest I paid myself.  It was expensive and it was a long time ago.For 3 retrievals and 2 transfers we have spent a total of about $80kFET cycle was about $5,000.$10,000+/- for Vericocele repair surgery. Stand by TESE fee of $1,500. Then office visit costs. Thus far, my IUI cycles have been covered by insurance including medications, so I was just responsible for co-pays.  However, when I start a new cycle for IVF my insurance won't be covering it and it will cost a lot.My insurance has covered most of it so far but we will eventually likely be out of pocket. IVF cycle- $10,500
Tests, medication, special procedures (ICSI) billed separatelySo far one DER and two transfer puts us around $35,000. We do have some insurance coverage and are hoping this overall cost is much less. However, billing through insurance takes a very long time so I am unclear right now of the exact totals.15k+Keep in mind this was over 16 years ago. I paid nearly $10,000 out of pocket. I had insurance but nothing was covered at the timeI had some fertility grant money which covered medications.  I think we paid for 2 cycles - something like 10K each (I don't remember exactly)I was covered mostly by insurance but paid out of pocket for icsi and pgd and embryo storagei don't rememberFertility is not a cheap proccess. Luckily we had coverage with a cieling and the doctor prepared us for out of pocket costs.The costs are about the same as other IVF clinics. $10,00013000 for treatment that involves ICSIMy insurance covered my care with Dr. Reichman. My insurance only covered doctor visits and blood work. 13K for the IVF treatment. Blood monitoring was $100 per session and ultrasounds were $300 per session before insurance The IVF cycle was $10k, my medicines were free as for cancer patients. IUI was around 5-6k for one cycle I have the blessing to work for a company that included fertility treatments as part of its health benefits. At this point, I had met my deductible and incurred no or little out of pocket costs.Very expensive.Co pay for each visit with Dr Reichman.  Around $125 for each trigger shot. Insurance covered clomid almost completely. my insurance covered everything. i was only responsible for copays. however the frequency in which you see the dr results in 100s spent on just copays.I was paying deductibles. Will get a bigger bill for the TESE.About $12k for a full round $13k for the cycle including ICSI Under $1,000 for IUI and procedures done prior to IUI.The first cycle was close to 15K. Insurance helped a lot. We paid out coinsurance and deductibles.$15,000 per one full cycle: monitoring, retrieval, and transfer.
Drugs are aside.I had insurance coverage so I do not know cost. I will say there were not any ""hidden"" costs.More than $20,000 per donor egg cycle.$15,000$4,795.00$10.5k for retrieval cycleThere were no issues here.roughly 25K for IVF cycle plus medsI think about $6000 for clinic I had to pay 450 for a mock transfer and 690 for an IUI.I have insurance that covers 2/3 of my cycleTotal, all in:  $100,000Only had a consultation (~300?) with bloodwork. Insurance has covered most if not all costs to date with Dr. Pereira's services. I am not yet done with my first cycle but my medications have been covered so far by insurance. Medications for one cycle would have cost $11,300 if out of pocket.Iad to pay over 3,000 also paid for pills 50.00 and trigger shoot 125.00 but is worth it for having a baby140,000 including medications instructed by Dr. ReichmanAbout 1500 in copays I think and the surgery more Mostly insurance... IUI out of pocket $800I think IVF was 15k ish. FET are 4KOverall I spent my full deductible / out of pocket maximum on my treatment in both of the calendar years I saw Dr. Pereira. Under my insurance plan, that meant spent roughly $1500 in the first year and $1250 in the second. I don't recall the specific costs per procedure. Our TI cycles were covered by the insurance and we had to pay for the medicines and copay.Most of my care was covered by insurance, but there were some confusing issues with billing and procedures that were billed incorrectly.  It was difficult to deal with the billing department at times and I still have billing issues I need to resolve.My insurance covered most of the costs. I had to pay approx $500-600 in total out of pocket.Due to our very restricted insurance carrier, we paid out of pocket expenses on most of the medicines and procedure.  Roughly out of pocket, our expenses including the entire procedure were circa $26,000.  That included everything.Ivf cycle $10,500
ICSI $2,630
Sounding $600
Facility Fee $1005,84
Anesthesia $600
————————-
FET $4,260
Embryo Cryopreservation $1,050It was covered under insurance.  I do wish they had more detail around costs of some of the genetic testing as i don't believe all of that ended up being covered.Cradle to grave costs not covered by my insurance including donor egg was about $20,000I had a $20 co-pay each visit.  I was amazed at how much our insurance covered.  I did pay a bit more for the fallopian tube test, I think around $80.  So probably in total I spend $400-$500I was lucky enough to have good insurance so I think I paid a $50 co-pay at each visit, $20 for the ultrasound and $30 for blood work.Clomid around $25 o $30 dollars per cycle. 
HSG around $1,000
Trigger shots - $120
IUI - $750  (not included in my insurence) 
Laparoscopy - $3,000 My costs were reasonable. I did end up having a lot of bills because I saw Dr. Pereira for almost a year and had two minor surgeries, so those were a little bit expensive until I met my out-of-pocket maximum for the year.Copayments; medication costInsurance did not cover our first round of IVF, so we ended up paying about $30k in all. I was able to switch to a different insurance plan before my second retrieval so paid less. Dr Reichman's staff was always transparent about what the costs would be before we started anything.My husband and I are fortunate to both have some fertility coverage from work. During 2018 when we were banking embryos, we were on his insurance, which covered the entirety of the 1st and 2nd round. We paid about $15,000 out of pocket for the 3rd round.for regular appointments with Dr. Schattman, I only paid my copay with my insurance. 
For IVF cycle, please be advised that this clinic might be more expensive that the others. 
their IVF cycle for 1 fresh transfer: 10,500
for any frozen embryo transfer: $ 4,260
ICSI: $ 2, 630
Cryopreservation: $ 1,050 (storage $ 262. 50/quarterly); 1st 6 months waived
Anesthesia fee varies if your insurance covers it but they have a facility fee $ 1005.84 during the day of egg retrieval which is an additional expense. 
Insurance covered but responsible for many copays, some medications.I had insurance coverage. My out of pocket expenses were $1000 for endometrial co-culture, several trigger shots, and misc.I was lucky as my insurance covered IVF 100%; the cost of the medications were mostly covered as well. We did pay a few hundred dollars though for some genetic testing and other blood work to be done as I had two previous miscarriages.My insurance paid for up to 40K of my expenses. After I hit my limit, I have to pay OOP. Approx 10K for egg retrieval (all monitoring included), 1K for ICSI fertilization, 4K for PGD/PGS testing. 1K hospital fee. Not sure what frozen embryo transfer will cost. Meds were covered by insurance but i think it cost 10KFrom what I recall, an IVF cycle with ICSI was approximately $20K.I paid OOP for this whole cycle. I think it was around 20k? Still working through this, but IUI under our insurance is 50% covered. No IVF or medication coverage, which right now having everything submitted through insurance which we are now receiving the bills for, comes out for about 23k. This does not included staying in an apartment since we live in Georgia.Insurance covered most of the charges, but I had to pay 10-12K out of pocket. Most of the costs was because we PGS Test 14 embryos which increased the costs. The clinic can be quite pricey if you do not have insurance that covers the costs. However, we were very lucky but still had to pay for other costs. My insurance did not cover some of the medication and facility costs as well, so I ended up spending 10-12K out of pocket. My insurance covered all of IVF aside from the genetic testing of embryos which was 7k. While a cycle at Cornell was slightly more expensive than IVF at my previous clinic, it was worth it!I don't remember the full costs. We were mostly covered, but did may for our embryo storage, PGS testing, fetal blood cell testing, etc. It wasn't cheap, but honestly, after getting pregnant we never thought about the money again. My insurance paid for a lot of it. We did have to pay for one retrieval cycle out of pocket. Egg Freezing total, including meds : about 11,000Part of IUIs/first round of IVF was covered by insurance. Second round of IVF was paid entirely out of pocket because we had used up our insurance infertility benefit.The initial consultation with Dr Rosenwaks was approx $600-700 out of pocket. The lab work, egg retrieval, and embryo transfer were mainly covered by insurance and I was responsible for the co-pays. Our insurance covered all costs except for PGS! Since our insurance did not cover ANYTHING related to ART, we estimated the whole thing (IVF cycle, retrieval and hospital fees, parking, medications etc.) put us close to $25,000. We also live 3-4 hours away so would sometimes stay overnight, which also added to that cost. mine was mostly covered by my insurance.  Don't recall the exact costIn total we paid approximately $20,000 just for IVF. IUIS I believe were about $1,000 each.IUI was ~750, IVF cycle was approximately 10k for one cycle plus injections were ~6k, plus ICSI was ~2,500, Frozen cycle was ~4k.  Insurance covered Fibroid surgeries, lap, IUI and IVF but i had to pay until we hit our out of pocket max. I paid out of pocket for IVF, which was around $15K.
I paid, out-of-pocket, $60,000 or more for costs including, egg retrieval and freezing, embryo creation, frozen embryo transfers, doctors visits, special ultrasounds, etc.  The breakdown of the costs was very hard to keep track of, so I had to write diligent notes and create charts to stay organized and be financially prepared for the bills to come.  I'm lucky that my insurance covers 15K in fertility medication (per lifetime) and 3 rounds (per lifetime). For the first round, we reached out 15K in medication! We still had to pay out of pocket almost 3K for medications on top of that. We learned that pharmacies charge insurance companies insane amount of $$ for meds. If you are paying out of pocket for medications, there is a significant discount.  For the second round (new med protocol and paying out of pocket, we have spent about $3100 so far, significantly less than previous.  

I do not know the cost of specific services.  

Genetic testing is not covered under insurance and is about $4100 out of pocket.  Even if not embryos are recommend for transfer. ~$11,000 for the retrieval
~$10,000 for the PGS testing
~$3,000 for medications (insurance covered some)
~$4,000 for the transfer
I think it was about $580 or so. And I got out of network insurance Coverage for it.  I really can't tell because he's part of general costs that we pay for IVF. I was incredibly fortunate to have insurance coverage. Out of pocket, co pay for prescriptions were around $1,000. Megi (Dr. Pereira’s assistant) was great explaining everything to review with our insurance company so we could better plan for any out of pocket costs. Our insurance is Cigna and our out of pocket expenses for services from March-August have been well under $2,000. For us, each IUI was somewhere around $500-700 out of pocket. All IVF costs, including drugs and ICSI, for us were about $18,500. There were some other incidental costs along the way probably totaling around $1000 - I think $600 for a final test before IVF, some sperm tests, and copays for visits and a surgery.At first , I had no coverage and monitoring appointments ran about $450 each time. My husbands insurance added some coverage during our rounds which helped but everything, especially the medicine and retrieval were expensive. We had to pay a fixed fee for the IVF treatment in the beginning.  We were lucky to have infertility coverage through insurance, so we only paid copays. My co-pay and extraneous costs not covered by insurance.20-25k per cycle. Only had to pay for copay and embryo freezing but my insurance does have an 18k cap so the next cycle will be out of pocketEverything was out of pocket for us.  We spent 15-20k for each cycle.  I do not recall IUI cost.My IVF was covered by insurance but the cost at the time was approximately $12000 for IVF with ICSI (we also did Micro-TESE in conjunction which was $15k out of pocket)

My IUI is also under insurance so I am not aware of the costs. IUI's were mostly covered by insurance, aside from $25 copay for each appointment (including monitoring) and $125 for trigger shot. In total, I paid about $300 each IUI.

For IVF, the total cost was about $20000 (including PGS-testing), almost all out-of-pocket. Medications were an additional $2000. Each frozen transfer will be another $4500 (or so).IVF with ICSI including fresh transfer was just under $12,000. Medications were about $6,000-8,000. Hotel for 3 weeks was about $6,000. FETs were about $4,000 plus medication and hotel.  ~$28k out of pocketThey were covered under my Fertility insurance, but the costs at Cornell are very high. About $15K per cycle plus then add on service - freezing, ICSI etccomparable to other fertility clinics in new yorkBase price approximately $17,500 for an IVF cycle before cost of ICSI, embryo storage, anesthesiology fee, hospital fee and meds.  There are also a series of tests needed prior to starting IVF that can add up.  Total price varies for each patient and I would say ours was between $22,000-$30,000 for each round of IVF with an insurance ART life time max coverage of $10,000, which was of course maxed out within the first IVF round.4 rounds of IUI plus 2 rounds of IVF totaled $48,000. I paid about $13,000 out of pocket after $35,000 in fertility benefits/insurance was used ($25,000 for treatment and $10,000 for medication). Note that fertility medication for the first round of IVF cost approximately $11,500 with insurance covering the first $10,000. When you use insurance, the prices of the drugs are somehow inflated. For the second round of IVF, I purchased the same amount of fertility medication, but since I was paying out of pocket, it only cost around $4,000 instead of $11,500. I do not have the total costs for the third IVF cycle yet.My out of pockets cost for 2017 was $14,366.  Healthcare benefits was exhausted since last IVF.
Medications ~$5,000 out of pocket
IVF Fees ~10,000 out of pocket (last IVF I paid $5000 out of pocket as benefits were exhausted)
PGS Fees ~2,000-5,000 (depending on number of embryos tested)  1st IVF, I paid for 7 embryos to be tested and did not have any tested on 2nd round
Hospital Fees ~1,000 (paid twice for each egg retrieval
Other Dr Visits/Lab Work ~2,000 out of pocket after insuranceMy insurance covered my treatmentsHonestly cannot remember but each round of IVF was approx. $20-25K (excl genetic testing, incl ICSI, FET, meds)Consultations or sit downs, IVF Fee, Hospital fee, Medications, Frozen Embryo creation and storage. 10,500 initial
Approx 5,000 on meds
1500 - 2000 approx for facility fee/anesthesia
3,000 for ICSI and frozen embryo 
I paid out of pocket for medication with my insurance coverage and the Ivf was covered. I did have some additional fees associated that had to be paid.$16500 for IVF and ICSI Medications cost a lot. Only $1800 was covered by my insurance. The balance of the treatment was covered and I paid co pays and some residual costs. The cycle monitoring without transfer was about $9400, but there is a cost of facility for retrieval which is additional $1200. ICSI is about $2500 and additional costs for freezing and storage of embryos. Medications add up to another $4-5K depending on the protocol. After you are gone it all adds up to $20K+I have insurance coverage for infertility procedures, so I only paid my insurance deductible and, in some cases, co-payments, as well as PGS testing fees and embryo storage fees.30,000 for ivf, frozen cycle all drugs associated, full genetic testing on embryos. Freezing extra embryos, also paid a nurse to come to my apartment daily and administer all the ivf shots. Insurance paid zero ivf costs so paid for all of it. Everything was out of pocket, Dr Rosenwaks does not accept insurance. All procedures were attempted to be billed to insurance, though I had minimal coverage.My insurance covered my care with Dr. Davis and most of my medications.I had to pay out of pocket for IVF cycles, given I had my eggs frozen a few years before.  My insurance company would not cover IVF due to my frozen eggs, and Dr. Kligman recommended doing a fresh IVF cycle before using the frozen eggs.I was fortunate to have a good deal of insurance coverage.
I did not have insurance coverage. The IVF cycle cost $10500, my medications ended up costing $5900, the freezing of our embryos cost $1000 and we paid about $1000 for a sounding test and for sperm analysis.My insurance covers 70% of infertility services, up to a certain amount. Infertility medications were also covered, up to a certain amount. I did have to pay for 30% of each blood test, ultrasound, and whatever balance was left from my IVF cycle + ICSI after my insurance allowance ran out. ET- $10k-$15k, meds $3k and ET-$4kIVF w/ ICSI is about $13,000 + cost of medications which for me was about $2-3,000Insane. $20k for one round of ivf when you add up cost for ivf, icsi, sounding, and meds. $5k for each natural frozen cycle. Pgs was over $6k so we declined. appx 12k for IVF procedures and 9k for medsMy insurance covered 90% of fertility treatments up to $20,000.  They are very up front with the costs of each procedure so it is easy to anticipate our out of pocket costs. IVF cycle with co-culture: $11,500
ICSI: $2,630
Anesthesia: $800
Hospital admitting fee for retrieval: $1,005.84Dr. Kligman accepts some insurance and we had coverage for many of our treatments but paid out of pocket for fertility medication and some hospital charges.  Medications - $14,000; IVF - $10,500; ICSI - $2,700; Hospital Fee - $1800; Embryo cryopreservation - $1100 per year; Individual consultations/visits with Dr. Davis - $550 each, probably around 6-8 of those total including initial consultation and follow up after achieving pregnancyHe does not take insurance. Appointments were $200-$500. Ivf was $12k plus additional for icsi, pgs, etc. They give a handout with th expenses. The initial IVF cycle is $10.5K but that's not including medication or anything in the holdouts. I think it was roughly 15K without medication. $10,000 for IVF 
$2,500 ICSI Each IUI cycle cost about $4k, for all the appointments, blood work, ultrasounds and medications.  For IVF, the full cost was about $12k.Dr Davis is Out of Network.  So I had to pay out of pocket for his visits and procedures e.g. hysterocsopy, pregnancy ultrasound.

Initially I paid out of pocket for all procedures, meds and most bloodwork.   They have a flat fee per IVF procedure with add'l cost per transfer.  Within range of expected costs for IVF comparable to other clinics.

My Insurance started covering IVF in 2016 - costs decreased significantly to deductible only. IVF $10,500
ICSI $2,630
The costs included all the monitoring done with bloodwork and ultrasounds, one cycle of IUI, egg retrieval procedure, PGD/PGS testing, ICSI, Embryo transfer. unfortunately insurance in CT was not covered for me so I payed everything out of pocket. He does not take insurance for his appt's either. The cost were astronomical!I do not recall.For 2 cycles about $40k including all medicationsapproximate total for one round of IVF cost me about $22,000+.  That includes medications which were around $5-6k. I was able to lower the estimated medication costs of $8K but receiving donations from friends that had unused medications.  To use the hospital at NY Presbyterian (for retrievals and transfer) cost an additional $1100.  The cycle itself cost about $10K, then additional fees for ICSI, embryo culture, egg freezing, and some other items I can't remember.  $15,000 for IVF- they did not take my insuranceFor every dr appt or monitoring appt there was a copay coinsurance to pay, plus copay/coinsurance for blood work, andrology services. For the IVF there was a set fee that was pretty inclusive for the cycle.IVF with ICSI, PGS testing and the frozen embryo transfer totaled about $35,000.I think I spent about $10,000. My medications were covered, but that was it. ~$11K for the cycle (not meds) and ~$2k for ICSI. $14K for micro-TESE and a surgeon stand by fee. Out of pocket for meds was about ~$5k
Egg retrieval performed in an OR, so anesthesiologist and facility fee also required. Maybe covered by insurance if local. IVF was about $15K.  TI/IUI cycles were about $4-5K.   I had to tack on extra costs for OHSS management at the end of the IVF cycle.  I was fortunate that diagnostic testing early on and blood work throughout were covered, otherwise that would have added up astronomically in the IUI cycles.  (IVF fee covers blood work until actual pregnancy testing and evaluation.)Insurance covered three rounds of everything then it covered the monitoring and procedures we paid out of pocket.  I don't remember the amount.I have paid everything out of pocket and it costed me approximately $30k (1 iui, 1 fresh ivf cycle, 2 FET and histeroscopy) I have insurance from the state of Massachusetts --"" Romney care ""-- which provides excellent coverage so I was not too aware of the price per procedure .Insurance covered everythjng.$10K per IVF round, additional $2K for ICSI$10K per cycle. Does not include the cost of medication which was made clear. Also didn't include the cost of anesthesia which was completely hidden as well as the use of another room in NYP hospital for which there was an exorbitant fee, also hidden.Oh gosh. I think we spent over 100K total, for 6 cycles at 2 clinics, and certainly the bulk of that was at Cornell. No insurance coverage. The year we did 3 cycles I think we had over 50K in medical expenses on our tax returns. Roughly $10k-$15k out of pocket for both cycles. This is because my insurance covered a portion of it. 45K through insurance, approx. 150K out of pocketI mostly had insurance, but I think each round of Ivf was around 20,000 and the donor was 35,000.  Get were 5,000.My insurance covered everything. all i know, it was out of pocket and not cheap. It was about 12K for one IVF cycle. Almost $100,000, and that was after insurance. Around 10,500 each time.thankfully insurance covered the care10,000 aprox for an IVFroughly 10k for IVF another $2500 for ICSI, $1k for AnesthesiaAbout $10k per cycle$40kIt was covered under insurance Insurance covered 80% of meds. Paid $1700 for them. 
IVF total cost: 13kWe spent around $25,000 out of pocket$19,000 for ivf with monitoring, ICSI and PGS$14k for ivfI spent close to $20K$25,000+/cycle - some of which was covered by insurance$60000My insurance covers infertility 100%, even IVF so my out of pocket was my deductible.  Very reasonable for 2
Cycles (doctor was out of pocket, but I got partial reimbursement; clinic was in-network); totally out of pocket for a 3rd cycleOur insurance does not cover IVF so we paid out-of-pocket. Each round, including all medications, totaled to approximately $25,000. Each frozen embryo transfer is around $4,500. My insurance covered $15,000, so we had around $58,000 out of pocket. Retrieval is ~$10, hospital fee/anesthesia ~1K, PGD testing ~$4K-6K (depending on #of embryos), frozen transfer ~$4K. IVF with fresh transfer was around $14K all in, TESE and hysteroscopy were fully covered by insurance so can’t remember the price tag. As we did not qualify for IUI and IVF medical coverage with mine or my husband's medical status, we had to pay a lot of money out of pocket, easily in excess of $20k after IVF.It felt reasonable in comparison to other treatments and he worked with us to ensure we had the best care. He was very kind and worked with us to make it the most affordable.With Dr. Reichman's suggestion, I upgraded my insurance to a plan that covered 90% of the infertility treatment.  Everything done in the office was covered.  Majority of medication and medical supplies were covered. Had to pay out of pocket for all IUI treatments. There was a discount for same-day payments.The costs themselves were based on our insurance coverage and we luckily had fairly good coveragecosts seemed pretty standard and in-line with other clinics. Was covered by insurance for me so I am not exactly sure.

The majority of the services I received were covered by insurance. 25k+ for IVF before medication, IUI 1.4k and trigger shots $100 if not covered by insurance. All of my medications needed pre-authorization and I would pay out of pocket mainly due to timing for Clomid, which is quite inexpensive. The coordinator was very helpful in informing me what is covered. The retrieval and transfer for IVF was about $12,000, the meds were covered by insurance (about $10,000) except for $750 that I paid out of pocket.

35,CCRM New York,doctor,"Working with Dr. Choi was great.  We did a bit of research on Fertility IQ before choosing a clinic & doctor and were not disappointed by our choice.  Knowing time is extremely important we didn't want to waste time in not-a-great-experience.  We wanted a doctor with a solid reputation and results.  Right from the first consultation we were pleased by the amount of time Dr. Choi spent with us, including detailed explanations of all required testing, fertility treatment options including risk factors and percentage chance of success, and any limitations.  Again we had done a bit of research on infertility before any appointments so we were able to jump right into conversation with her.  She heard our concerns and addressed them.  She was very factual and speaks quickly, so we always needed to be paying close attention.  I brought my notes from home and my recent cycle dates on paper and she appreciated it.  
Two times, after testing results were received, we would send detailed questions/concerns into the Facility's nurses inbox and Dr. Choi called directly in reply.  She allayed concerns, not with any pretense of guaranteed results, but reminding us there was likely not any one factor that would determine full success or full failure.  We appreciated the personal touch. 
Dr Choi's protocol selection for me was spot on.  The research we did on our own shows it was slightly aggressive but had it not been we would have not likely gotten the same results.  The egg retrieval experience was good as well. She also always called with results (with any thing more than normal monitoring instructions).   Dr Choi and her staff also worked with us patiently as we changed our minds a couple times regarding how we wanted the IVF cycle to proceed (fresh vs frozen transfer; PGS testing or not).  She said, ""I'll do what you guys want to do,"" so it made us feel heard.  Ultimately we went with her recommendation; and we feel we got the best results we could have.  His strength is looking at you like a person. He takes into account all aspects of your life as they relate to fertility. Not just ""you are infertile!"" -- as I had heard at other providers. He is compassionate, but not coddling. He is direct, which I appreciate on a daily basis. Just tell me what I need to know and what the plan is! He was available for questions in the appointment, via email and via phone. (he is busy though, so it is hard to catch him at the office!) He actively listened and gave an informed, detailed medical opinion based on knowledge, science and anecdotal experiences. He doesn't rush you either. It may take a while to get an appointment with him, but know that he will spend a lot of time with you! I always feel confident in our plan when leaving the appointments with Dr Levine. This is a hard review to write because there were so many aspects of our care under Dr Knopman that we felt positive about, but in the end we could not recommend her.  

The positives.  She will respond to your emails/calls and you will actually see her and get to know her as your doctor.  She absolutely knew us as people and as patients.  She is approachable, intelligent and was quick to admit when our case went beyond her comfort zone at which point she referred us out to a consulting specialist.  

The downsides:  She felt very rushed, careless and not as thorough as we would have liked. She contradicted herself on multiple occasions.  On one occasion, she performed the wrong kind of sonogram on me.  The nail in the coffin was the fact that she failed to make note of the medications that the specialist (who she referred me to) prescribed.  As a result, she prescribed me two medications that I was already taking.  

When our case became complicated, she justified proposed treatments with anecdotal stories instead of studies. This made us feel like she wasn't willing to dig deep for answers and was instead relying on whatever evidence jumped to mind.  

Ironically, we felt that she was at her best when she called to give us bad news (failed IUIs, IVF cycles and chemical pregnancies).  At these moments, she slowed down and provided us with thoughtful unhurried responses to our questions.  

We did not get pregnant with Dr. Knopman and I don't know if that is the result of her care.  If I'm honest with myself, I don't necessarily think it is.  What I do know is that in the end neither my husband nor I had confidence in her attention to detail and the stakes were too high to risk having a detail fall through the cracks.  We've since moved to another clinic and feel much more confident that we are getting the level of attention we should be.  Even if we don't ultimately get the outcome we want, we feel better about the process than we did with Dr. Knopman.   Brian Levine is a good communicator and great Doctor who encourages us to try for IVF despite my low ovarian reserve. He calls you personally on the weekend to give your results. He answers any questions you have through email and listens to your concerns. Really, he wants all his patients to be successful and we are glad he's our Doctor. Dr. Knopman was absolutely fantastic.  Going into fertility treatment my husband and I were not sure what to expect but she was aways honest and open, direct and encouraging.  Dr. Knopman was innovative and willing to try new paths if a cycle did not work out the way we had hoped, she never repeated the same cycle twice without first considering alternatives or other avenues.  She gave us tough news in the kindest way possible and was also our biggest cheerleader when we took steps forward.  Dr. Knopman changed our lives and we are so grateful to have had her each step of the way. I would recommend dr. Talebian to all my friends. I am still going through the IVF process but regardless of the outcome she has my full trust. I know I am in good hands with her. She is smart, dedicated, caring and kind. She makes me feel like I am not alone in this journey and is as vested as I am. Dr. Knopman is a communicative, intelligent, caring doctor who will give you the best treatment every step of the way. She is willing to take each case as an individual situation and think outside the box to get you to your end goal. She is candid and casual and I felt like I had known her for years after meeting her for the first time. However, she is also blunt and to-the-point. If you are somebody who wants things delivered delicately and know the you prioritize hand-holding, she may not be the doctor for you. I would recommend Dr. Knopman to anyone who is seeking fertility treatment and would be confident that they were in the best medical hands.Warm, thoughtful, an expert communicator who can synthesize complex medical terms into examples and language that were uniquely applicable to my personal situation. I've been singing Dr. T's praises all summer/fall and would refer her to ANYONE (friend or stranger) considering working with CCRM. Dr. Knopman was definitely sincere and caring. She is a quick talker and super knowledgeable, so be prepared to take notes or records your session. She is also very observant around her patient's emotional state and is very easy to talk to. And post retrieval surgery she personally calls you with any and all results and next steps.I feel that she was very honest and compassionate about our case. We are on the older side, and she has been honest about when we should continue down a particular road, or when she thinks it's time to change course. She has been willing to talk me through tough choices on the phone and been available on weekends, which has been tremendously helpful through this process. I am so happy to be in the care of Dr. Knopman. She is very positive without overpromising results. She clearly set cautious expectations and was 100% correct in her prediction every step of the way throughout the stimulation and retrieval process. 

Dr. Knopman had to break the news to us about my Diminished Ovarian Reserve (my AMH is incredibly low for a 33 yr old) and was aggressive and direct about her recommended course of treatment. While overwhelming at first, I am glad she pushed us to act quickly. We will be working towards ""banking"" embryos now so there will hopefully be the possibility to have a child now as well as another a few years in the future. Without this aggressive action, I don't think we would be able to have children in a few years since my egg reserve will only get worse.
 I am not someone that usually writes reviews, but Dr. Talebian was so amazing in our journey that I felt compelled to share my experience.

I believe that Dr. Talebian was instrumental in our success and we would not be where we are today without her. From day one she looked at me as a person that she could help have success and she never wavered from that belief; even when I myself did. She never gave up on my case. She was reassuring and took time to explain things in person, on email, and on the phone every time I reached out and needed reassurance, encouragement or an explanation. She was beyond patient.

Advice- don’t be afraid to ask questions and do that over googling. The internet is scary and often times wrong.

Trust her and believe in her. She knows what she’s doing. She will tell your her POV and guide you- let her.
From the moment we met Dr. Brian Levine my husband & I knew right from the start we made a great choice. We discussed my hard road with endometriosis my previous surgery & he was very compassionate & a great listener. He was also extremely intelligent & new everything about this disease & reassured me their were options to be taken. It was comforting & gave me hope back that I was afraid I was losing before our first visit with Dr. Levine.Dr. Knopman is positive and direct. She greets me every appointment with a caring question and tells me what she’s seeing as she goes. She personally called me when the one embryo which was created came back normal from genetic testing and was genuinely thrilled. She has stated she loves the OR and Ultrasound and her enthusiasm comes through. We came to see Dr. Talebian after completing 3 failed cycles with another clinic. I wasn't sure if we would get turned away since we had some failures but instead she was pleasantly positive. She did not give false hope, just stated facts and let us know we aren't at the end of the road yet- which is what we were hoping to hear. She was relatable and empathized with all the life style changes we have had to make in the past year. She understood the need to keep life as normal as possible and gave the OK on things we had previously cut out because of IVF. I never felt rushed or that any question was silly. Dr. Choi is incredibly empathetic and compassionate. She listens to my concerns and questions.  She’s also been willing to adjust my course of treatment to try to better maximize the outcome. After three egg retrievals, I had only one day-5 blastocyst. Given this, she adjusted the transfer cycle to perform additional testing typical only undertaken after a failed embryo transfer. Rather than risk my one embryo, I appreciated the proactive approach to do the extra testing beforehand. Let me start by saying I think all the doctors at CCRM are really the best out there. I decided to see Dr. Choi because I really liked her manner and tone. She had a very calming air about her and seemed to be very sensitive to my needs. I went to an information session put on by the doctors and then followed up with a consultation with Dr. Choi and after both I knew I made the right decision with the practice and the doctor I decided to see. She was so thorough and really took the time to get to know me and explain the process fully. She made me feel totally at ease with my decision to freeze eggs. She was compassionate but also very straight forward which I really admire. I had a wonderful experience with her.As I mentioned previously, we did not feel like a number with CCRM. Compared to a few other clinics, the Dr-patient interaction is amazing. Being diagnosed with Premature ovarian failure we knew our chances of a successful IVF round were low. At each failed cycle she was able to express her sympathy, while also guide us towards positive next steps to move forward. For a brief period (due to insurance coverage) we left CCRM and after a few months with a new dr, I had to return back to Dr. Talebian's care. Before I say anything, if you're reading this, you're probably worried about where to go. Let's just point out that the staff, embryologists and lab at CCRM NY are perhaps the best in the world. Its so new that everything is latest and state of the art (not to mention it FEELS this way when you are there), unlike lots of other places. 

Also -- I'm a success story of Knopman's. A 2 year old (5day frozen) and pregnant with #2 --also frozen.

Ok let's start with Knopman's staff. Many doctors are really difficult to their staff-- but with Dr Knopman, you can actually FEEL how happy her nurses and admin staff are! (dont you want to go to a place where everyone is happy and taken care of??) 

Let's talk about the care and attention. Knopman is aware of every piece of research and development in this field and uses this with her patients and practice. 

When she is dealing with you, it is with a really unusual and great balance of empathetic but also informative. The time and energy she puts into every patient is pretty incredible.

Dr Knopman is a smart, savvy, kind, compassionate woman -- and mom herself, which I swear makes a difference. She also donates a ton of her time to providing care for women that can't afford fertility --because lets be honest, it's a big issue.Dr Levine is exactly what you want in a fertility doctor - patient, empathetic and explains all of the details - or as much as you want to here. He is very focused on continuing to have a game plan which is important when you are going through infertility. You need a next step and hope! 
He was always available via email and gave his personal cell. He even made himself available to us on weekends. 
Dr Levine did all of my procedures - 3 IUI, 1 egg retrieval with PICSI and genetic screening of embryos and FET that led to a pregnancy and the birth of our beautiful daughter. We have 1 frozen genetically screened embryo from the initial egg retrieval. There isn't one weakness to mention of Dr. Brian Levine.  Dr. Levine is an ABSOLUTE miracle worker.  I came to him after 2 unsuccessful IUIs, 2 horrendous retrievals, and 2 negative transfers in my home state of Florida.  He took the time to uncover a diagnosis and treated me for endometriosis.  I wasn't an easy case but he always made me feel comfortable and I was confident I was with the right Doctor the minute I met with him.  He performed all my procedures and was extremely supportive throughout my experience as a patient with him.  No one should think twice if given the option to work with Dr. Levine, It truly is a honor to have a doctor so caring and accessible as he is/was.Dr. Knopman is very direct and straightforward. She does not hand hold. It is incumbent upon the patient to do their research, she does not go into detail about certain plans and treatments, but does offer those plans as suggestions. I think one of the hardest parts of going through IVF is the education that grows deeper at every stage and the understanding that it's not up to your doctor to give you that education. Your doctor is part of your support system but they aren't your only support system. Their role is clearly defined and Dr. Knopman stays within those boundaries. She is compassionate and accessible when necessary. She doesn't respond to every email, but not every email is always necessary for her to respond to. She includes nurses and other staff when questions are better suited for those individuals. She is not warm and fuzzy but she is kind. It took some adjusting for me to get used to this style, but I am definitely better off for this because I need the truth and along this long, long road I don't need someone sugar coated things. I trust her. We came to Dr. Levine after trying to conceive for several years without much success. Dr. Levine is a physician and scientist, and he found the right way to communicate with both my husband and me from the very beginning. He explained things in great detail and at no point, I felt confused about the process or about the next steps. 

Because it was our first time seeing a RE, he started with a very thorough diagnosis procedure and recommended that we attempt IUI first, explaining to us the success rate of this procedure compared to the slightly more invasive IVF procedure. After a few IUI attempts that were not working for us, he recommended that we move on to IVF, which we did, ultimately achieving success on our first embryo transfer. 

Dr. Levine’s approach to our case was personalized and data-driven. He cited up to date studies pertaining to the procedures we were involved in and was very thorough and knowledgeable in answering all the questions I had about the whole process. As an academic myself, this was very important to me, as I knew I didn’t have time to read all the relevant scientific literature on the protocols and procedures we were about to experience.

Dr. Levine performed my egg retrieval procedure, which was flawless. I experienced minimal side effects and there were much more eggs retrieved than I anticipated. The pre-op and post-op communication was amazing.

Dr. Levine is very well connected and has amazing contacts in the NYC area. As I developed thyroid issues early in my pregnancy he recommended a great list of endocrinologists that I could choose from, based on my health insurance coverage and preference. He also recommended a long list of great OBGYNs at graduation and made sure I checked out to an OBGYN he trusted upon graduation.  

Dr. Levine’s skills, combined with his sense of humor and vast experience make it easy and fun to work with him, which is incredibly important given how stressful fertility journeys can get. I recommended Dr. Levine to everything I knew was struggling with fertility (at other clinics). My experience was stellar with Dr. Talbien. She was confident and knowledge about IVF ...I never felt as if the transfer wouldn't work and if I did have doubts she had solutions and reassuring words that helped ease my worry. Dr. Talebian never once made me uncared for, she treated me like a VIP!My husband and I were referred to Dr. Talebian after several failed attempts at IUI and IVF. When we first met the Doc we were at a point of feeling broken and hopeless. My husband, who is trans, had already had 2 failed IVF attempts and I had several failed IUI attempts.  The plan was for him to produce eggs that I would carry. As soon as we sat down with the Doc we knew we were in the right spot.  She never lied or filled our hearts with false hopes, but she did make it clear that she wasn't willing to give up until we were holding our baby.  As many who have traveled this road know it is not easy, it's an emotional rollercoaster and very personal.  It is the most vulnerable who will ever feel.  You sit there and discuss yourself in full detail and can't help but feel like you're a failure because you can't do what ""normal"" people do.  The Doc never made us feel like failures, not even when outcomes beyond anyone's control weren't what we hoped or planned for.  When it turned out that my husband just could not produce eggs that were viable the Doc shared in our tears, but never let us feel like that was the end.  We discussed new options and directions at length and she was always willing to listen to all of our ideas no matter how crazy they were.  She made herself available at all hours so that we could do conference calls, she even stepped out of a dinner party one time to call us because that was most convenient for us.  She never left us in the dark and we never felt alone.  She made us feel comfortable with every step, test and procedure. She was so dedicated to us that even after being dragged on the ground by a taxi, the morning of my retrieval, she got her head stitched up and walked into the room ready to make a baby for us.  She said nothing was going to stop her from making this happen. I don't know any Dr. who would do that for their patients, so we really felt more like friends.  Everyone who has done IVF treatments knows the daily testing that needs to happen, we happily drove from NJ into NYC, in stupid amounts of traffic every day to be a part of the Dr Talebian team.  With her help and determination we were blessed to get pregnant with our daughter born this January.  We still keep up with the Doc and send her pics and updates all the time.  We could have never done this without her.  And to think 2 years ago when we walked in her office we thought it was never going to happen and now we have a beautiful baby girl and 2 fertilized eggs still left to try for number 2! This was our first clinic (of 3) so we weren't entirely sure what to expect from the process. Dr Talebian was very helpful in our first meeting and explained our options as a same sex couple, and was very inclusive to both my wife and myself. We decided to proceed with IUI. She was away for the first IUI and had another doctor cover. We were not successful and then decided I would go on letrozole for the next cycle. We tried 2 more IUI with Letrozole without success. Not once did we ever receive any follow up email from the doctor to check our progress or if we were successful or not. The communication was pretty terrible in general, and at one point when trying to clarify things Dr Talebian became quite rude and unprofessional over email. We didn't feel a great deal of sincerity from her and the communication made us feel uneasy about receiving full information and trust regarding care, at which point we decided to look at other clinics. My husband and i couldn’t be happier to have met Dr. Levine and CCRM. Months of frustration with the “factory” at RMA, everything changed when we walked into CCRM and met Dr. Brian Levine. Instantly impressed at our first appointment, Dr. Levine had already thoroughly researched , highlighted and took notes on our case. Before even talking with us, he’d already discovered i was misdiagnosed previously and didn’t take lightly how easy my case looked on paper being “young and healthy”. After our first meeting, we were sure we were moving forward with our second IVF cycle and we couldn’t have been happier from day on. Everything went exactly as planned from that moment. Within 3 months we are now pregnant on our first try! He is not only a wonderful doctor, but he is confident and caring . Always a quick email away, no matter how silly or insignificant a question. He makes you feel comfortable every step of the way. He is truly an amazing, intelligent doctor. Also, to note, while Dr. Talebian was not the MD i met with on day one, she took great care in my case as well and treated me as one of her own. CCRM is truly the best team there is. Not enough words to thank Dr. Levine (and his wonderful staff)!I had gone through a bunch of FET's already that hadn't worked and had had a 2nd trimester loss so I really needed optimism. Dr. Talebian is full of optimism; but I really got my hopes up and they were dashed as we did not have success. Also now sense we're being directed to frozen donor eggs, not fresh, and there aren't many donors in the frozen egg database so it's discouraging. I think she really cares but maybe should be more realistic about options and about underlying issues that area already known. Really wish we could have seen all the implantation failure doctors before this latest cycle as they had great suggestions after 4 embryos didn't implant elsewhere. But we are out of money and CCRM is very pricey.Dr Knopman is extremely knowledgeable, spent time going over our history and formulating a game plan that worked for us. When our first round of egg retrieval did not yield results as expected, she course corrected and was able to explain and justify why another cycle could work. She gained our trust, was always available to answer questions and provide both medical and emotional support through our fertility JourneyDr Levine is an extremely positive, confident doctor. While that is one of his greatest strengths, I think it has lead to me being overly hopeful about my treatment. (The ups and downs of this process are always hard.) He is extremely diligent and thoughtful in his approach. He listens to what we want and responds accordingly. He is always available to answer questions and schedules phone consults or emails when an in-person appointment is not necessary. We were looking to find a new fertility clinic after several rounds of unsuccessful IUI and IVF treatments. Even before we decided on CCRM Dr Levine took the time to understand our fertility history and our case from the very start. He didn’t recommend treatment until he had reviewed our medical records from my previous clinic closely (something another clinic that we were exploring didn’t do and just proceeded to recommend treatment). He took the time to review and discuss our records with us and what his recommendations were. My husband and I were both impressed by Dr Levine. Either he or another doctor did all my ultrasounds and my appointments never felt rushed. Dr Levine also did both my retrieval and transfer, explaining everything along the way. He’s personable, always has an open line of communication, responsive to emails, and is great at what he does! With Dr Levine’s our first round of IVF treatment was a success and we couldn’t have been happier. Dr. Levine was amazing from start to finish. He was our second doctor, after two failed rounds of IVF at another clinic, and we weren't sure what the problems had been. He was careful and methodical as he examined our records and encouraged us to do additional testing to figure out the issues. It was all worth the wait, because we are now pregnant after our first embryo transfer with Dr. Levine. He shares his email with his patients and responds over the weekend, at night, early morning and in one case, even while on vacation. He cares about his patients, which is important when dealing with such sensitive issues. Dr. Levine is honestly the BEST. He took what had been a terrible, chaotic, anxiety-inducing experience and turned it into a structured, calm, and unexpectedly FUN experience. Dr. Levine explains everything extremely thoroughly and on repeat. You hear the same message over and over again, and it's so reassuring and empowering, because you know the plan at all times. Dr. Levine also has the most fun personality. He takes the time to chat and catch up, and we spent just as much time talking about different exercise classes we liked, restaurant recommendations, and LIFE as we did my fertility issues. This may seem silly, but it really changed the dynamic of my treatment from negative to positive. I looked forward to my appointments with Dr. Levine because they were so fun, and I left feeling happy, confident, and taken care of as an individual. Dr. Levine is a special doctor.  He is passionate about what he does, and it truly shows.  He truly cares about his patients' well-being.  He is always available to talk when needed.  He even reaches out to make sure you are doing ok.  He is confident, funny, reassuring, empathetic, honest, and positive.  I am so very lucky to have met him. Jamie is one of the only doctors I would ever do this process with and I had COMPLETE trust in her. I have have the upmost respect for her. She completely supported and guided me through this whole process in an honest, sincere way.  She told me the truth and I knew that I was always getting an accurate picture of what was going on which helped keep my expectations in check. She also always offered advice, changed protocols and did whatever she could to look out for me. She made me feel totally invested in my journey and was beyond dedicated. What other doctor would postpone vacation plans to be able to do my egg retrieval?! She is just knows this process with her eyes closed and extremely competent. I always valued how she just knew what to do, what to say, wasn’t an alarmist, but was also very real and always accurate with her insight and predictions. 

I think the most of Dr. Knopman and recommend her to any of the closest people in my lives. Anyone is lucky to be under her care!Dr. Talebian is the first doctor that has given me their direct email and made me feel that no question was too small. She's prompt in returning messages — even in the evenings. I just started my first IVF cycle with her. She's extremely knowledgeable, kind, and accessible. Please see what i wrote under the question about feeling like a human. I have zero complaints. she is THE BEST. She thinks outside the box. She welcomes questions about chaining protocol instead of feeling threatened. She works with me instead of acting like the doctor at the other NYC clinic i went to who dictated decisions and seemed to find my questions about them annoying. I never get the ""i am the expert so defer to me"" vibe from Sheeva. She acts like a partner, not a dictator.Dr. Knopman is straight forward and warm. I completely trust her and feel like she fully explained all of my options. On a few occasions she hasn't described things to me in the most delicate way-- ie: describing my uterus as a ""war zone"" because of inflammation, but I have never felt like she minimizes my experience or invalidates what I tell her. Having had a poor experience at another fertility center, we moved to CCRM for Dr. Levine. I had heard great things about him. My husband and I loved him and felt comfortable with him immediately. After our experience with a doctor that was unapproachable and unresponsive, we were looking for the complete opposite of that. Dr. Levine is extremely approachable, warm, professional and compassionate. You really feel that he wants the best for his patients; his bedside manner is excellent - caring, empathetic, honest while being positive. He was always available, via appointment, email or phone. He took his time with us always and spoke to us like people rather than patients. I felt very comfortable with him and know his care for me was individualized.Covered most of this above, Dr. Levine is amazing and will make you feel incredibly comfortable, which is a luxury during a super stressful and emotional time.

My only constructive feedback for him would be about managing expectations. I was told upfront that my outlook was very good, and 8 months later am still not pregnant. As long as you manage your own expectations, you are in the best hands. Keeping my fingers crossed for the rest of my journey! Dr. Levine’s two best strengths, his compassion and his knowledge of the fertility field, make him an unparalleled doctor.  On our first visit, he discussed many different protocols and the types of patients who are successful in each.  He is very well versed on the fertility literature and studies and as such, he is able to offer both the most successful protocols and able to tweak them slightly to improve our success.   He never ordered frivolous and expensive tests.  Every question I posed to him was answered with science backed evidence.  He explained the rational for every step of the embryo transfer.  His optimism helped me believe we were going to have a baby.  When I was having serious doubts about continuing what I thought was sure to be an unsuccessful cycle, he encouraged me to continue the cycle, and it ended up being our most successful one.  As I mentioned above, I knew that Dr. Choi would be the Dr. who would get me pregnant. She is an exceptional Dr. with a wonderful bedside manner. Her honesty and sincerity was always appreciated. I would recommend her services to anyone who is pursuing a fertility journey.Dr. Janet Choi made this entire experience amazing. Her attention to detail and you as a patient is more than I could have ever asked for. She is knowledgeable, caring, and always there when you need her throughout your treatment. I was really surprised by how amazing the whole process went and I have shared this experience now with many others. I plan on seeing Dr. Choi for any and all fertility treatments I may need in my lifetime.After a few rounds of unsuccessful IUI and egg retrieval,my body needed a break from the hormone medication.  Something in me was telling me not to go straight to the embryo transfer.  When I told Dr. Levine this, he is 100% supportive of my decision to take a few months off from treatment and never tried to push me. In fact, he called me over the weekend from his cell phone to talk about the importance of listening to your body, and that taking a break in treatment was totally normal.  When I was ready for the transfer a few months later, he picked up right where we left off.  I always felt heard and well taken care of through all circumstances. Here is our story and how Dr. Levine touched our lives and continues to touch our lives.  My wife and I are in our mid-late 30s and had been trying for our first child naturally for 8 months.  Naturally, my wife and I were getting anxious and dreaded each period, which when it came, we were back to the drawing board.  They didn't tell us having a baby was supposed to be this hard.  We did some research and found Dr. Levine at CCRM.  We learned that CCRM was a famous clinic from Colorado and people would fly there from all over the world.  Dr. Levine had just opened a branch in NYC after training at all the best places (e.g., Cornell and NYU).  We had an initial consultation with Dr. Levine that lasted about an hour and a half.  We were very impressed with his facility – it was private, it was calming and everyone we encountered was so sweet.  I was pleasantly surprised how much time the Dr.  took with us.  Dr. Levine had all the tests available to him and explained to us that all the traditional metrics suggested both my wife and I should have no problems conceiving - but yet we were having problems. Dr. Levine took the time to get to know us and my wife both on a medical level and a personal level – what is my wife’s medical history, but also, what drives us, what do we like to do for fun, etc...  We thought we were visiting with a friend.  My wife went into the meeting pushing for IUI of IVF - she was tired of waiting and wanted to get pregnant ASAP.  I was not as alarmed, but I was worried that given my wife's state, that the Dr. would proceed with the more expensive approaches without exhausting less invasive avenues.  Our experience with Dr. Levine was quite the opposite - he took time with us and was focused on less invasive approaches before turning to IUI, IVF and other treatments. 

Through our initial casual meeting Dr. Levine was able to deduce that my wife tended to have a lot of mucus in her sinuses and, moreover that it was thick. Dr. Levine explained that sometimes thick mucus could prevent the sperm from reaching the eggs - I guess sperm can't swim through thick mucus - who knew?  Dr. Levine suggested that that my wife take standard over the counter Mucinex once a day for a week during ovulation as a first step.  Guess what - we were pregnant within a week!  A true miracle.  Dr. Levine guided us through the first 8 weeks of my wife's pregnancy which was such a comforting experience.  We saw Dr. Levine once a week for 8 weeks and each week we learned more about the development of our baby, what to expect and all the time, knowing that we were in the best hands.  Dr. Levine continued to reach out to us through the entire pregnancy, even when my wife's care was turned over to her OBGYN.  And thank goodness he stayed in touch with us.

At 37 weeks pregnant, we got some of the worst news a family can get - my wife was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer.  Things were sort of a blur for a while, but we had to have the baby as soon as possible so that my wife could undergo scans and treatment.  Luckily my son was full term because my wife had to be induced within a few days after diagnosis.  We now have a beautiful healthy baby boy who is the light of our lives and, while all sorts of people played a role, much of the credit goes to Dr. Levine.  My wife had to commence treatment right after our son was born.  The treatment raises all sorts of questions related to future fertility - did we want to have more children?  Is there time to harvest eggs?  Could my wife even carry another child?  What are the risks?  The questions and the decisions were overwhelming.  At times they still are.  But Dr. Levine has been with us the whole way.  Advising us at every step - what are our options, how can we maximize our options while not compromising my wife's health?   And he does this over the phone, via text message, during the weekend - basically whenever we need it.  He is compassionate, extremely knowledgeable and proactive - he knows the difficulty were/are going through and he rises to the occasion.  He was in constant communication with my wife's OBGYN.  Quite frankly, Dr. Levine went above and beyond - and he does this as his standard practice. 
During these last several months, my wife and I have engaged the medical system more than we ever thought we would and we are constantly moved by the quality of people that provide care.  Dr. Levine is in the absolute top of this class, and I would recommend him and his practice to anyone any time. 
Dr. Talebian was patient and caring with me from the start of treatment. Furthermore, she was never defensive and always willing to consider my thoughts and ideas. This is a rarity in doctors. I felt like she genuinely cared about me and my future baby.  She provided incredible communication over email, the phone, and in person.  Dr. Talebian went above and beyond during my miscarriage and subsequent successful pregnancy to help manage my emotional state and well as fertility plan. Dr. Levine was nothing short of a Godsend for me.  He made this process so positive for me.  I was nervous going in and he guided me and my husband every step of the way.  And just made it so seamless.  I have already recommended him to every single person I know that is going through infertility.  ""Pregnancy brain"" is preventing me from articulating my thoughts, but I truly think he is the best and cannot say enough good things about him!Dr. Levine is truly the best of the best. If you are considering a fertility specialist and have come across this review - stop here! He is amazing and you should definitely pick him. My husband definitely developed a little bit of a bro-crush on him as well. He made both of us feel so comfortable and confident every step of the way. He was always on time - sometimes even early! Can't beat that.I think I covered this in the section asking about why I was treated like a human and not a number.  But, one other thing to note - I'm currently 7 weeks pregnant with a chromosomally perfect soon-to-be son.  That's entirely because of Dr. Levine's abilities as a doctor - he took us from no viable embryos to a pregnancy in less than 6 months.Warm, friendly, honest, good sense of humor, very optimistic, determined to get us the results we wanted. Our experience with Dr. Levine was one of the best I've had. We really felt like we were his only patients when we were in the office. When we finally got a positive pregnancy test after a few months of treatments, he had us come in on a Saturday morning before 9am to do an ultrasound immediately. Always available, always responsive and really went the extra mile. Brian, put simply, is a sweetheart who wants the best for his patients.  He is compassionate to their individual situations and wants to achieve the best outcomes for all.  He is extremely well read and versed in all of the latest techniques and procedures in the fertility world.  I would recommend him over anyone in the NYC area, having seen fertility doctors at both Cornell and NYU.  At those institutions you're treated like a number, whereas at CCRM you're treated as a human.Dr Knopman takes the time to get to know her patients and give them the best chances possible for them to get pregnant. She was thorough, positive, attentive and well researched. There was a level of trust that other doctors didn't provide. I think that CCRM and their doctors have a higher standard of care that other clinics should follow. Dr Knopman is fantastic - smart, kind and relatable. After my first appointment with her I left with an overwhelmingly positive feeling - something I never felt while at NYU.  I feel that she truly cares about me and my care.  She is easily accessible by email and phone. I feel very grateful for Dr. Choi. She is exceptional at her job. She knows how to be with patients and fertility treatment. She walked me through all of the information each step of the way for my IUI. Her staff is knowledgeable and compassionate. I am using a sperm donor and as you can imagine the IUI is a very taxing process to begin with and going about trying to conceive as a single parent just adds more anxiety, stress and overwhelm.  Dr. Choi has the bedside manner and compassion to go at my speed, and make sure I understand everything she is explaining.  She has called me after 9pm to return a phone call or emailed me with information if I needed it. I have asked her about ideas that I have heard about, extra vitamins, exercise regime, diets, and even some mental health support- she referred me to an excellent therapist who helped me deal with the emotional component of all of this.  Dr. Talebian is smart, kind, and efficient.  I trusted her completely and got great results.  She always explained things very thoroughly and answered my emails if I had questions between visits.  I felt like my anxiety about this process was lower because of her care.  I had initially gone to another clinic first, but felt a lot of anxiety during my testing.  At CCRM NY and with Dr. Talebian I felt so comfortable and well cared for.  Under his care I  was comfortable enough to try for my third child a fourth time. If I never met him, I never would have even tried again. He is an extremely positive individual and extraordinarily dedicated to his patients. I felt like he was only treating me ... knowing he was taking care to treat many.  He delicately explained the risks and options. He encouraged questions and provided honest consultation.  I would and have recommended him to many friends and friends of friends that ask me what they should do knowing my fertility journey is a long but successful one. Our experience with Dr. Levine was easy, stress free, and actually enjoyable. During such a difficult time he made it the best experience it could have been. I felt like he was ALWAYS available, and I truly felt like he cared about the success of our outcome. He is just as invested in you and your results as you are, I promise you that! Dr. Levine is so pleasant and more importantly very knowledgeable. He created the perfect plan for us and it worked. From the very first time I met Dr. Levine and his entire staff, I knew we were in good hands. I feel like we made the best decision by not wasting time and going with their practice. Thank you to Dr. Levine and the wonderful CCRM team for their support and kindness.He had lots of good ideas about how to change our treatment protocol to increase chances of success given that we saw him trying for our sixth attempt.  He wanted to leave no stone unturned and made sure that I had hysterosalpingogram performed and recommended an excellent doctor to do it.  He recommended my husband have a karyotype.  He looked into my prolactin levels and wanted to make sure to address the slight elevation.  He wanted me to look into my questionable aspirin allergy in case I needed anti-coagulation in the future.  He was very, very thorough.  We agreed to do a frozen cycle although we were more interested in a fresh cycle.  It seems they don’t do many fresh cycles there.  They also encourage we do PGD testing.  Given our past experience with high numbers of 5 day embryos (13 blasts in 4 cycles) and only 1 normal by PGD which was transferred but did not work,  we did not want to do PGD testing this time around.  The only unexpected issue was that we expected a lot from the laboratory and the incubators there at CCRM which he explained were top notch.  Given we agreed to a frozen cycle, they pushed our 7 embryos past 5 days which had never been done with the previous IVF clinic we used. He explained they looked good at day 3 and then started to slow down and then basically stopped developing.  So we never got to the transfer stage.  Dr. Levine was so nice and cheerful, especially when going through something that can be scary. He completely picked up on my and my husbands moods and was there to make us feel better, explain every step and reassure us both. He was also ALWAYS available! Every random question or fear, he called us back the same day and answered emails at all hours of the day, I really don’t know how he does it! You feel like you are his only patient, you have 100% of his attentionChoi was our second DR in our fertility process and we had interviewed 3 when we chose to leave our first DR. She was by far the most knowledgeable, realistic, and caring. I truly believe that if anyone can make this happen for us it would be her. Due to unexplained egg quality issues we've had some ups and downs along the way. Her experience and expertise always put me at ease. She is a great communicator and you can be sure that she's putting the most effort and thought into your case. She always called us to explain results and options, even off hours. With a difficult case, I still was able to become pregnant from the single embryo transfer we were able to have and I give full credit to her.As I said in my earlier statement, Dr. Levine is the best doctor I have come across in any field. He has revolutionized the way I think about my healthcare in general. He is the anti-paternalistic traditional doctor, and you can tell that is so important to him. He was truly invested in me as a person, and my success. He factored in things like how certain decisions would affect me emotionally and psychically. Not only did he treat ME like a human, but HE was an authentic human as well. We communicated like normal 2017 humans, via email and text, on the regular. He was available for every single question and concern I had, and I felt empowered in my care and the decision making. At the same time, I trusted him completely. A minor example s that he actually had picked out a song especially for me for when I was receiving my anesthesia. How many doctors think about individual patients to that extent?!Dr. Brian Levine has been by far among the highest blessings we had in our life over the course of our fertility journey.    Our journey began in a state of panic when my wife learned that her ovarian reserve, her FSH levels pointed towards essentially a diminished ovarian reserve, poor egg quality that helped explained a couple of miscarriages she had naturally.   Through online research, we determined that her numbers may not even qualify us for many IVF clinics because the possibility of a pregnancy was very low and naturally clinics would see that working against their success statistics.  Dr. Levine didn't once use numbers to determine whether he would see us or treat us.  He made the time right away and sat down with us and focused on listening to us.

At our very first appointment, Dr. Levine focused on asking very detailed questions about our history, our family history and my wife's pregnancy history.  What we most appreciated was that while he clearly understood our numbers, he took the time to understand our priorities, and why the pregnancy was important to us.   After listening to us for a while, he very thoughtfully pondered our options and then explained them to us.   He gave us a clear understanding of our chances and then laid out a plan for how to start.   

My wife and I left the office feeling hopeful that at least we were going to have a strong partner in this journey irrespective of where it led us.

Thereafter began a year long journey that started with an IUI and two IVF cycles.  At each step of the way, Dr. Levine took the time to talk to us personally and explain us the process, the risks and the chances of success.   He also took the time to give us clinical depth about why we were seeing certain results such as a disappointing first IUI and no embryos from the first IVF cycle.  

After our first IVF cycle, we were at a very disheartening cross-road about whether to keep trying or abandon our efforts.   Dr. Levine gave us not just the positive courage but a solid, scientific and statistical understanding and the exact treatment that he planned to pursue based on the learning from the first cycle.   He also coordinated some natural treatment for my wife such as accupuncture and yoga where he made personal calls to the acupuncture doctor to coordinate the treatment path.

At no point did Dr. Levine pressure us to jump right into the next cycle.   He cautioned towards making sure my wife's body was ready.   We took our time and then resumed another cycle that commenced in a positive pregnancy for my wife (currently 11 weeks and 4 days).

Now we have transitioned to an OB GYN and Dr. Levine on his own makes an effort to stay in touch about my wife's progress.   

We can go on and on but all in all i would advise anyone that few (if any) are lucky to go through an IVF and get straightforward results.  It is always a journey.  Every patient is unique, and brings their own circumstances.   You want a doctor who is going to meet you where you are in your journey.   Dr. Levine is exactly that doctor.  Dr. Levine was the most amazing medical professional I have ever seen. From the minute we met him during our consultation to the last appointment, he was always energetic, positive, informative and caring. He was always easy to reach and addressed all of my questions and concerns in a timely fashion. I really could not have asked for better care.Dr. Levine was very hands on and thorough. I never felt that I was a burden, like I did at Cornell where I was previously a patient. He was compassionate and understood the emotions involved with trying to conceive. He was also patient with my questions/concerns, and was careful to make a plan ""with"" me rather than for me. I felt that I got the best care available, and am very lucky to have been at CCRM! Thank you!! Dr. Choi was honest, smart, compassionate and gentle.  I felt like I had a say in every step of my treatment and every aspect of decision making.  Her knowledge was unparalleled and her quiet confidence gave me confidence in the success of my treatment.Dr. Talebian went out of her way to answer all of our questions, discuss the details of our protocol and what to expect and she was incredibly kind every step of the way. I also appreciated the fact that when the news she had to give wasn't the best, she was very rational and discussed all the options with us.I so appreciate how she has moved us through this process. I know people who may have taken years to get where we are. I trust her intuition and believe she has our best interest at heart. She is not lovey-dovey, and sometimes she has said things that weren’t the most tactful. But honestly, I trust her and that’s more important. And once when I was upset by the way we were treated by the donor egg bank, she called me within 5 minutes of receiving my complaint and validated my frustrations. Dr. Choi was wonderful. She was able to discover what was preventing me from getting pregnant--something that no one had previously been able to do. She was warm and caring and I felt that she was really paying attention throughout the treatment. , Dr. Levine, seriously a Godsend. He is the smartest, nicest, and most caring doctor I have ever met. He is not there to take your money; he is there to get you pregnant. Before going to Dr. Levine, I was told to get a surrogate, and after my first IVF transfer with Levine I am now 15 weeks pregnant. I tried one protocol for a transfer and Dr. Levine wasn’t thrilled with my lining and wasn’t going to do a “sympathy” transfer and had me try a second protocol, which he was happy with and the transfer worked! I would 100% recommend Dr. Levine!Dr. Levine gave me advice via email before I even had a one on one consultation with him and that's when I knew I wanted him to treat me. He took the time to explain every single step, the other doctors as well, his nursing staff, embryology staff and office staff are all knowledgeable and treat you like a person not a number. Everyone was a dream to work with and even the appointments were kept on time and they accommodated me as much as possible. I would recommend Dr. Levine and CCRM NY without question.She was diligent and careful with recommendations and screening. Fertility doctors and treatments are stressful and her bedside manner made it seem like less of a stress.  She was encouraging and resourceful. We loved ccrm and Doctor Levine so much that we already recommended four friends to him.  His staff is very friendly, compassionate, and knowledgeable.  Someone always picks up the phone and someone always calls you back with an answer.  We went to four other clinics and ccrm by far had the best staff,
Best doctors, and provided very personalized attentive care. We will he going back to CCRM again in the near future if we have issues with a natural pregnancy. Dr. Choi is excellent.  I have done multiple IVF cycles with her, and after each cycle, she adjusts the protocol for the next one based on what she learned from the previous cycle.  Surprisingly, my other doctor at a previous clinic never did this.  She is very frank in her approach, but also very compassionate.  She is always available when needed to explain anything, and never rushes through a phone call or conversation.Dr. Knopman was absolutely the right doctor for me - she was caring and knew about my case, she reassured me when I was worried for no reason, and she wasn't worried if there was no reason to be. And I got pregnant on my first IUI, so clearly the treatment worked. Dr. Levine is a wonderful person and a great doctor. However, he is very young and with that youth comes an aspect of being uncomfortable delivering news taht may not be what the patient wants to hear. For someone who wants a super positive person always giving them the best most optimitic outlook, this is the Dr for you. If you, like me, got to a point on this journey where you just wanted the cold hard facts with no BS and no coddling, this is not the Dr for you. The false sense of optimism was somehow more crushing than dealing with the realities of my situation. I am still not pregnant. I first used another fertility clinic in NYC, but when I heard that CCRM was opening an office here, I switched immediately.  Infertility is a scary and nerve-racking process to begin with, and Dr. Levine made it incredibly less so.  I cannot say enough good things about him.  He was personable from the beginning.  He is extremely responsive to e-mails, phone calls, etc.  He takes the time to recommend treatment that is specific to your case, and not just a textbook protocol.  Dr. Levine honestly made me feel like I was his only patient. I went into this process having read online that with numbers like mine egg donation would be he only way forward but Dr. Levine explained he strengths of their lab and science and how we would work through this together for the best possible outcome. He was always available to speak either via email or phone and no question was ignored. Dr. Kang is warm, caring, and honest. She is straightforward in presenting recommendations and tries to set realistic expectations. She makes an effort to do all of the transfers herself. I have found her to be very approachable, supportive, and thoughtful in planning out next steps along this journey. We’ve had an amazing experience with Dr Choi. She’s caring, thoughtful, and incredibly smart and motivated, at the forefront of research in the field. We trust her completely and truly feel she is the best partner for our journey.Dr. Knopman explains things very clearly.  At the same time, she doesn't overwhelm me with information I am not asking for.  During the process, I didn't always want to know every detail, because it could be too overwhelming.  She went over the options and helped me arrive at the right plan for me and my husband.  She has a good bedside manner that made me feel comfortable during the process.   Dr. Choi is brilliant, a fantastic problem solver, and truly cares about her patients. She is the best doctor I’ve ever had.  She gives you the facts with data to back them up, but also cares on a human level about the outcome. Dr. Talebian is an incredible doctor. I loved how she also suggested alternative medicine like acupuncture and changing my diet. Dr. Talebian is extremely thorough and kind. I feel like I am in the absolute best hands with her.Intelligent and detail oriented. He will look at all angles of your patient history and ensure the best outcome possible. On top of that, he has a great sense of humor and connects with patients making them feel at ease during this difficult time.He totally understands us and takes a human centered approach to our care. He was an excellent communicator and we felt like we had someone in our corner trying to help us achieve our goal. Coming from another, larger clinic, we felt much more at home with Dr. Levine. He was willing to try new and different approaches to help us get pregnant.Janet was straightforward, realistic but warm at the same time. I have already recommended two friends to her. She took the time to explain everything to me, even though I was running 15 minutes behind for my first appointment. She was very easy to talk to and made me feel empowered. Highly recommended! Dr. Talebian showed a willingness to spend as much time with me and my partner as we needed in order to answer every question and address every anxiety. She is both honest and kind. Over the course of my interactions with her I have come to trust her. She has shown a respect for our individual path to fertility treatment and has shown deference to our values and our thought process, even though I’m certain she’s had these conversations a million times. She shows an openness to discussion and discourse that we truly appreciated. She made no guarantees and created no false hope but more a confidence that every that can be done will be done.Brian is amazing, explained everything really well and shows utmost patience when I persisted with many questions. Always optimistic and thorough. Having now successfully given birth, I have nothing but positive memories left. She was so compassionate and caring during such a stressful time. She treated me like a person not like a number in a clinic. I never felt rushed during appointments with her. She always took the time to explain everything that was going on and when things needed to be changed during treatment she herself would explain it.Dr. Levine believed in me, when I thought my days of being able to have my own biological child were over. I was at the end of my infertility journey, when I met him and I thank God everyday for placing him in my path. I have had two IVF doctors and Dr Choi was head and shoulders above the other. She treats every patient as a unique individual case to be treated. Nothing is cookie cutter with her. She keeps up with all the latest research and is happy to impart that knowledge. There are not enough amazing things I can say about the brilliant Dr. Choi. From answering my incessant emails to calling back in a timely manner if I had a question...nothing was too small. I have never met a smarter or more compassionate doctor. Seeing her smiling face during high stress visits and her kind reassuring words that we would figure my infertility challenges out together, I never felt alone and I always felt fully supported...did I mention she is BRILLIANT!Dr. Choi had me laughing and enjoying the process.  She explained everything that was going on with my body.  She explained risks and did not take any that would jeopardize a healthy pregnancy or patient.I feel that Dr. Levine is personable, sensitive, compassionate, and stressed the importance of remaining positive and  maintaining faith in the One Above. He recognizes the plight of his patientsand is attentive to questions and concerns.  I have seen 3 doctors. This time with Dr Choi, I was 38 versus seeing other doctors at 35 and 36. My results for the embryo retrieval with Dr Choi were every bit as good, if not better, than in my earlier years. The process was smooth and easy and I can hands down say I think that CCRM NY is the best fertility clinic in NYC.She does a comprehensive evaluation and on the first visit she ran a test where it was discovered my prolactin was sky high.  this was an anomaly that had not been discovered prior my other rounds at another clinic.  She quickly sent me to an endocrinologist for further testing as this indicated issue with my Pituitary gland.  I am thankful for her knowledge!Dr. Levine was there to answer all of our questions and concerns. He walked us through every step of our treatment plan and made us feel comfortable every step of the way. Dr. Levine's bedside manner is second to none. His attention to every detail sets the tone for the whole office.Dr. Knopman is extremely smart, but she is also able to explain all the medical stuff in accessible terms as though I were her friend.  She was encouraging and honest and answered all my questions promptly.  She performed my retrieval and I absolutely trusted her and had zero pain or spotting after.  All positive things to say. Felt very comfortable in his hands and enjoyed working with all of the nurses. Communication is consistent and everyone is always very reachable. It is not hard to make an appointment and they are responsive to all questionsshe is caring, communicative, always available.  she is open and honest and she truthfully and genuinely cares about her patients.  when you are in her care you feel like you have a teammate in this journey.  she reviews all the scans an labs and you know the decisions are coming from her.  Cannot recommend him enough—and I have very exacting standards and rarely recommend things. He was always available with a smile, smart, explained everything and really set the standard for medical care in general.I switched to Dr. Levine after two years at another practice and became pregnant on the first try. From the beginning, he was empathetic and explained everything. Our care was beyond personalized. Meeting Brian Levine was one of the best things that has happened to my family.Dr. Levine was a pleasure to work with. I love how he didn’t jump to IVF, but rather took a more natural approach of evaluating my cycle, then recommending IUI after seeing there weren’t any obvious issues. We had an excellent experience working with Sheeva. Expectations were set, we had a clear line of communication and we always felt comfortable. Sheeva has a fantastic bed side manner, she explained everything thoroughly and clearly and never gave us false hope. Excellent. Dr. Choi says it like it is, but kindly and sensitively, and professionally. I have seen numerous RE's over the years and she has surpassed them all. I feel that she cares about her patients and fights for their outcomesDr. Levine is extremely comprehensive and provides the utmost care to all of his patients! From the very beginning he delved deep into my family history before coming up with a strategic plan. Each failed month, he himself called me to adjust the plan accordingly. Unlike the previous clinic we had been to, Dr. Levine gave me the opportunity to conceive naturally with medication assist before jumping to IVF. He was always realistic in managing my expectations while remaining sensitive to my emotional needs. Dr. Levine breeds positivity in the most refreshing way. I so appreciate him, his expertise, patience, and commitment to my case. Dr T was so compassionate, kind, empathetic, honest, direct and understanding.  She never dismissed my many concerns and always treated my husband and I like human beings.  Through every single setback, she was on the phone with us (once for over an hour), listening, explaining and clearly/calmly outlining our options. I would recommend her to anyone (and have - 2 of her current patients are my close friends!). Dr Talebian always responded to our questions - via email, over the phone, in person. When we emailed her with any concerns, she responded quickly even when she was on vacation or if it was on a weekend. She is clear in explaining our situation, the results of each cycle, the changes to protocol and why. When we had to find another clinic for surrogacy, Dr Talebian helped us through the entire process, even through the multiple setbacks. She is amazing and I would not be seeking care from another doctor if paid surrogacy is legal in NY. Dr. Levine is an excellent doctor and a wonderful person! He used science to achieve success. Every visit when we met with him he took the time to talk with us and answer all the questions we had. Infertility is a hard subject for women to deal with, and he did a great job dealing with it. He always gave us options with the risks and benefits of all the treatments. Dr. Talebian is great. She is warm and responsive when needed. She wants to aggressively help her patients get positive results by using all of her medical tools. She moves quickly to get results and I would recommend her to everyone/anyone. I had a great experience, resulting in my pregnancy. The doctor was straightforward and realistic but also reassuring and compassionate.
Plus, as a credit to their lab, I only had 2 eggs but one resulted in a PGS normal embryo that got me pregnant.Smart and results driven.  Expensive, VERY expensive and doesnt take insurance, but gets results.  Make sure to ask questions because she moves fast.  But she is nice and encouraging and cares.  She will lay out a plan and adjust accordingly. Listened to me. Treated me with respect. Positive yet honest with me. Felt like a friend and Not a number.  Never felt like a bother when I called with questions. From out of state - he worked with my schedule. Dr. Levine is very optimistic. We did 3 IUIs with negative result and 1 IVF cycle. We have one beautiful child and got really lucky. I guess you have to be positive in this business to survive all the despair. This comes with a mixed review from us, however. 

The wholly optimistic and positive outlook left us feeling crushed every time we got a negative pregnancy result, of which there were several. Personally, we felt “led on” to expect positive results and when that didn’t happen, the fall was incredibly harsh; more so than it would have been with more neutral expectations. We pleaded with Dr. Levine to give us the blunt stats, and although he did, he always spun it somehow to lead us to believe “this was the one that would work”.  When it didn’t, we were heartbroken and started not to trust the Polly Anna-like attitude. I guess it was self perseveration. 

On the other hand, now, in hindsight, with an absolutely perfect 6-month daughter, I question what it would have been like without this positivity. I don’t know how anyone could continue to try and try again, including the doctor, without hope, real or false. 

So, the mixed review has to do mostly with setting really high expectations that led to a crushing reality numerous times and loss of trust...until it didn’t. 

We would highly recommend Dr. Levine. 



While we didn't always have the results we wanted we were always thankful to have Dr Levine on our case.  Our journey took us down a much different path then we initially expected but we felt fully confident each step of the way that Brian would get us over the finish line.Dr. Levine is far and away one of the best doctors we have seen. There is never a question asked that he did not readily have an answer. He remains optimistic but also keeps your expectations in line as to not have false hope. He explains what he is doing and why each visit. His patience with questions, both in person and VIA email and phone is fantastic. Although we have not yet had success he is the only reason my wife and I still have hope!Dr Levine was kind, caring and attentive. We felt like he took the time to listen and get to know us.  We saw him at almost all of our appointments, he always took the time to explain where we were in the process. After our first conversation with him, we could clearly see he has passion and love for what he does. We felt very safe and positive under his care.I loved speaking with him. He was so patient, answering all my questions and explained things so I could understand every step of my care 

He is smart and innovAtive, always looking at creative solutions based on data and my own personal experience. He makes you feel comfortable as well Dr. Levine is a world class doctor, an excellent communicator, and all-around nice guy. Our infertility struggles were so hard—full of scary moments and several set-backs before seeking out Dr. Levine for care. What a difference a good doctor makes! Not only is he is an incredible talent, but also such a compassionate person. I can give no higher praise to any doctor. Dr Levine always goes above and beyond to ensure I feel important, secure in my treatment and at ease with a very personal and life changing experience. Seeing him during my consultations, scans and procedures, he always made me feel safe and extremely confident in my treatment. I have built up a great bond with Dr Levine, and I could never thank him enough for being so instrumental in helping me have the family I have always wanted. At all times I felt heard and acknowledged - I wish all patients could receive this level of care - the world would be a better place!!! I mistakenly took some medicine wrongly- and dr. Levine was immediately available, explained my options and course of action and assured me that my reaction wS also normal with the meds I was taking - Dr Levine was gentle, caring and genuinely had my best interest. He always made me a priority and made me feel like I could always reach out to him with anything and everything. I highly recommend him to anyone struggling with infertility.The office is beautiful, the staff is warm and friendly and always greets patience by name.  You deal with the same finance person for all of questions.  And the best part of the office is that all blood tests and scans are scheduled!  No first come first serve / open hours.  Makes a huge difference !Dr. Levine was amazing and treated my husband and I like we were the most important patients he had. He was responsive, always answered all of our questions in great detail and is extremely knowledgeable.The doctors and nurses are always warm and professional.Very friendly and caring staff and physician. Very open. Treated me like a friend more so than a patient. Very positive experience Dr. Choi was always friendly and treated us like smart adults who could assess information.   She remembered our situation, concerns, and addressed them in subsequent appointments.  She also went out of her way to say a quick hello even if we were only in office for blood work or monitoring.  It made us feel like we were ""her patients."" Dr Levine is kind, compassionate and an amazing listener. He takes notes without being distracted by them. (you know what I mean when a doctor is nodding, but not actively listening!) He took the time to understand and know us as a couple. ""Feeling like a human"" (to me) feels like a second home; someone who understands who you are as a person and not what season you are in or what role you play. It's nice to have someone ask questions about ME and not just about my fertility issues.Dr Knopman gave the impression she really cared about you.  She knew my name and was extremely friendly, but in the end we felt like in the ways that mattered most she wasn't paying attention.  On one occasion, I came in for a saline sonogram and she performed a standard transvaginal ultrasound.  On multiple occasions, she provided one response to a question only to provide a different one later (e.g. - do supplements have an impact on sperm quality?)Brian Levine is a compassionate Doctor who is encouraging of our quest to have a child despite my age and low ovarian reserve. We are doing all we can and the nurses and entire team of Doctors at CCRM are amazing. Dr. Knopman was incredibly interpersonal even when having to give tough news.  She stuck with us and always kept the ball moving forward even during setbacks, she was sympathetic and encouraging but also very pragmatic.  She always took the time to listen to our questions and concerns.  I felt like she really knew who my husband and I were and what we were trying to achieve and how we were willing to achieve it. Dr. Talebian truly cares about her patients. She takes the time to talk to you and understand your journey. Her treatment is customized and not generic. She listens. Dr. Knopman made my IVF experience at CCRM feel so personal. She allowed me to email her about anything (and everything... and sometimes I did) and she always got back to me within 24 hours (and usually much less) and was honest and straightforward. She also called me on the cell phone every step of the way-- with fertilization results, numbers of embryos sent to testing, PGS results (this phone call came on a summer Friday at 6pm!), pregnancy blood results etc. Honestly it took me some getting use to after the experience we had before CCRM, I was shocked at how often I was hearing from my doctor. It truly made all the different in our experience. From the very first meeting Dr. Talebian met me in the middle ground and offered care and compassion from a place of humor, kindness, and most importantly, facts.  She struck a comforting balance of providing me with the information I needed but also thoughtfully answered my far flung/nerve based ""what if"" questions. While my one-on-one time with Dr. Knopman was limited to ultrasound appointments and typically only lasted about 5-10 min, but during that time I certainly felt like a human.From our very first meeting with Dr Talabian, my partner and I felt that she was very kind and honest about what the IVF process would be like and what our chances were. She has been available to talk on weekends, has helped us with navigating the drug and insurance issues we faced, and has been there through our triumphs and set backs alike. I feel like I have a supportive team member under her care, and that the team at CCRM is looking out for me. CCRM provides incredibly thorough yet caring service - better than any other experience I've had with a doctor or medical professional. Both Dr. Knopman and the nurses are very accessible by email and phone and were ready to answer any and all questions I had throughout the process. I never once felt like a number- and I was at this practice for over a year. Every visit the entire staff treated me as a person and spoke to me by name and greeted me with the warmest smiles. I was never rushed through and every doctor, nurse, receptionist I saw was top notch. Dr. Talebian answered every email and question I had-- always doing so with encouragement and support. She never made me feel like I was wasting her time or that she was too busy to pay attention. She knew the details of my case intimately, and literally was always there for me and my husband.DR. LEVINE TOOK TIME TO EXPLAIN OUR OPTIONS AND ALWAYS ANSWERED MY QUESTIONS, NEVER FELT RUSHED & WAS COMPASSIONATE ABOUT MY SITUATION.Dr Knopman listened to what we had experienced at another clinic, gave feed back, ideas and plans from the first time we met. The protocol was based on doing something different to get a better result which made me feel like my health and needs were being acknowledged in a new way. We had two consultations with Dr. Talebian before starting with treatment. I was able to directly email her through the course of us deciding next steps and she got back to me quickly. Through our conversations she mentioned a few things that showed she understands the emotional and physical side to doing cycles. Dr. Choi always took the time to explain things thoroughly and consider my input. I was really happy with the time Dr. Choi and the rest of he CCRM team spent with me. They were always there to answer all my questions and help every step of the way, they all made me feel very comfortable. From our first consult, Dr. Talebian was able to give us her past experience at working at other NYC clinics (like RMA who we had previously went to) and describe in a very sensitive way how CCRM operates a little differently and her approach for my treatment. Throughout our time with her she has been available via phone and email and responds in a very timely manner. She is invested in our case and with every roadblock has given us options that work best for us to successfully move forward.Dr Knopman never made me feel like just a patient - it always felt that I got the BEST care and attention from her compared to all other medical professionals in my life! Dr Levine took the time to get to know our specific case and making himself available to us for consultation pretty much any time. He learned our goals and objectives and then we came up with a realistic game plan accordingly. Dr Levine and CCRM also understood that I worked an intense job throughout the process and their hours and staff are accommodating to very early appointments etc. it was a pleasure being in their care. I had been to a clinic in Florida prior to arriving to CCRM and Dr. Brian Levine.  I came to Dr. Levine quite beat down and broken feeling that I would never become pregnant.  Dr. Levine took over 3 hours with me on my initial consultation and kept in constant contact with me throughout my time with him.  He was available at any time through email or a phone call.  He went ABOVE and BEYOND for me every step of the way.  Currently, I am 25 weeks pregnant and he even reached out to me to see how I am doing.  He treated me better then I expected to be treated.  In the beginning, I think it's hard for doctors to know how long it will take for their patients to become pregnant, so Dr. Knopman wasn't overly friendly or accessible. After my first failed transfer, she kicked things into high gear and has been nothing but incredibly kind, reliable, transparent and accessible. We've experienced the highs and lows together (there have been few highs) and she is clearly invested in my journey. Dr. Levine has a very personalized approach to diagnosis and treatment. My husband and I appreciated his approach starting with IUIs and moving on to IVF when the less invasive options failed, ultimately achieving success. He was always accessible by phone or email. Dr. Talebian was amazing throughout my whole IVF treatment I always felt cared for and secure ...whether it be during business hours or the weekend my concerns and questions were answered right away. Dr. Talebian and her staff treated me with the utmost tenderness. She provided detailed information about IVF and walked me and my husband thru every step, we never worried under her care...I even recommended her to my dearest friend who struggled almost 10 years to have a child  and as I write now she like me are enjoying the new title of mommy! The process of Infertility all on its own is extremely personal, intimate and difficult.  Now add in that you have a Trans husband who is also trying to add as much as he can into the making of our child, only to find out the he is sterile after 3 IVF attempts. For him to step into what is ultimately the female side of infertility requires an extreme amount of trust with the Doctor and staff that will be caring for him.  This just would not have been possible if it weren't for Dr Talebian or ""Doc"" as we like to call her.  Both the Doc and the staff became like family.  They knew us by the sound of our voice on the phone and they never once let my husband feel like any less of a man let alone a number.Dr Talebian was very thorough on our first consult (as is usually the case) but the communication from that pint on was very brief and we didn't have much face to face. There wasn't much of a feeling of personalized care or sincerity.CCRM took the time, the care, and the love someone needs when going through such a tough time in their lives. Everyone welcomes you and know you by name and with a smile. Truly the best there is!Felt like a human because Dr. Talebian always took time to explain things to us and it was at the time a small clinic. Also, the monitoring was done by appointment so there were no hourslong waits. Dr Knopman was absolutely incredible.. She not only provided amazing medical advice but she was compassionate, had amazing bedside manner and provided us with emotional support we needed while navigating such a challenging time in our life.  Dr Levine is very personable and relates to me like a person. He always asks what we want to do, how I'm feeling, etc. He always wants to have a plan in case a cycle doesn't turn out like we hope. He also calls personally with all pregnancy test results (positive and negative) and with any concerns about blood test results. He gives patients his cell phone # and email address and he responds to emails (I've never tried his cell). He remembers me and my history at every appointment-- I never feel like a number. Dr Levine is extremely thorough and took the time to understand our situation and fertility history. He reviewed records from our previous fertility clinic in detail and took the time to discuss his findings and recommendations with us. I never felt rushed during my visits. CCRM's facility has the best customer service I've ever experienced in a doctor's office. Everyone is kind and respectful of the patient's time. On top of that, Dr. Levine was always friendly, always remembered details about my husband and me and made us feel comfortable during a very vulnerable and uncomfortable time. I can't express exactly how nervous I was to begin fertility treatment with a specialist. I had been trying to conceive unsuccessfully for 13 months, and I had a terrible experience with an ob gyn who tried to treat me using guesswork out of his office instead of sending me to a specialist. This experience had been totally inhuman, awful, and ineffective. 

I remember crying after my first appointment with Dr. Levine, because he treated me so warmly and compassionately from the moment I stepped into his office. I remember he spent a full hour with me discussing not only my case history, but who I was a person, what I liked to do during my free time, how I had been feeling about my fertility issues, etc. He didn't rush me, and he repeatedly allowed there to be pauses so I could ask more questions. 

Dr. Levine and his team wrote everything down for me, always. I know this seems so simple, but I can't tell you how reassuring it was to have a plan and to have that plan documented in writing. Dr. Levine gave me his personal e-mail, and he ALWAYS responded or called me back, even when I e-mailed late at night. I remember receiving a call from him at 8pm, 2 minutes after I had e-mailed, when he was clearly in the middle of a family dinner. 

Finally, the one moment I will never forget: receiving a call from Dr. Levine at 1pm on a Saturday, in between cycles, just to say ""Hey, how are you feeling about everything?"" Dr. Levine, as well as the CCRM NY staff, all knew my name.  I was never ever treated like a number.  I received personal care.Jamie, is the best of the best. I HIGHLY recommend her and completely trust her opinions, insights and knowledge. She was always accessible and responded to any of my questions through email immediately. She also got to know be on a personal level which made me feel more comfortable and not like a number. She talked to me things in my life, work, dating, family, and was personable, kind, supportive, real and honest. When I first called CCRM in New York, the very pleasant receptionist, Stephanie, made an appointment for me to talk by phone with Dr. Talebian. When we spoke, Dr. Talebian was straight forward and suggested I move on to IVF after three failed IUIs due to my age and my lack of positive pregnancy tests. I explained that I lived on the west coast, was considering spending a few months in New York, and I was open to doing IVF during my stay, but wanted to think a bit more. She gave me her direct email address and told me to reach out with any questions. Our phone call was about 20 minutes long and I was left feeling like I had a straightforward plan for next steps with a kind, clear doctor. I was also impressed that she praised my local clinic and doctor where I had IUIs. When we decided to come to New York, I sent CCRM NY an email to tell them I wanted to establish myself with their clinic and was surprised when a couple of days later, Dr. Talebian called me directly to talk about next steps. Since we've met in person, I've sent her a couple of emails and she's gotten back to me within a couple of hours at most. I'm sure she gets the same questions all the time, but she's been incredibly patient with us and answers questions with clarity.I saw Sheeva when i was doing my final embryo transfer at another clinic and had lost hope. She was a welcome breath of fresh air and gave me hope. I decided to move over to her for my next retrieval. She emailed directly with me. Gave strategy advice by email. Fielded questions. I NEVER felt like an annoyance. My transfer worked before i went to her for retrieval (early 2017)- throughout my entire pregnancy she stayed in touch. Again, never acting annoyed by my questions in prep for a future transfer with her for child #3. I am currently seeing her preparing for a retrieval in April - she is communicative, remember details, responsive. She is SO different than my experience at another top NYC clinic. The personal/human interaction has given me hope that i lost while at 2 other clinics in NYCDr. Knopman remembers details from our last conversations, even if we don't have a scheduled visit. Anytime I see her, she's always very warm and I don't feel rushed. Dr. Levine was always available, via phone, email, appointment, etc.. He spoke to us like we were people and not patients. He made us feel extremely comfortable and better about our situation. He's kind, approachable, professional and smart.Dr. Levine is the best. We were lucky enough to have gone to him straight away after recommendations from friends, and avoided the horror stories of ""feeling like a number"" at other clinics. 

He immediately establishes a rapport, can relate to you personally, and makes you feel like you are the only patient that matters during that time. He thoroughly answers all of my questions - day or night, in person, phone or email - and encourages me to ask them. I'm especially impressed with how promptly he returns my emails.

While I have still not gotten pregnant and am actually seeking a second opinion due to my unexplained diagnosis (just curious what a fresh perspective might uncover!), I feel super confident and comfortable with Dr. Levine. Just trying to be patient :) Dr. Levine always made me feel like he genuinely cared about me and the success of my fertility treatment.  He came in on his day off to do my egg retrieval because he recognized I was nervous about it.  He often came in on Saturdays to monitor his patients.  He was incredibly thoughtful to ask about my life outside of fertility treatments and then remember those conversations at later appointments. Throughout my entire treatment Dr. Levine treated both my infertility and the emotional toll it took on me.  When I asked him at our initial consult how I could better manage the stress of this process, he offered solutions and talked through different coping mechanisms. He allowed my husband to stay the room (which didn't feel like a sterile hospital exam room) with me during the embryo transfer.  It was really comforting to have my husband there and allowed my husband to feel part of the process.  Lastly, he always made time for me if I had a question.  He is very responsive on email.
 
From the moment I walked into Dr. Choi's office two years ago, I knew she would be the Dr. who would get me pregnant. Her professional yet sensitive demeanor, her honesty and her ability to be candid made me feel more like her friend, than her patient. Throughout my treatment she assured me I would get pregnant one way or the other. During my treatments she would call me at 9pm from home. If I ever had a question throughout the day about my treatment or any other dr I was seeing in conjunction with her treatment, she would never wait until the next day to reach me.  She always made me feel comfortable and cared for. Her determination matched my perseverance during my fertility journey and I will be grateful to her always. Dr. Choi provided the best care, utmost attention through every step of this process. I couldn't have asked for more. I had treatment at a previous clinic that my husband referred to as a ""factory."" We only saw our doctor if my cycle happen to fall on a day that she was in the office.  With Dr. Levine, almost always saw him for ALL of my appointments. 
 If there was an occasion where he couldn't see me personally, he handed off my appointment to one of the three other doctors in the practice, who I also loved.  The personal attention is embedded in the culture at CCRM, from the friendly staff at the front desk, to the nurses, to the doctors. 
The entire experience at CCRM NY seems like it was intentionally designed to address all the shortcomings of other clinics in NYC.  NYC is a busy place and with the general population having children later and later in their lives, fertility clinics are, quite naturally, busy.  From the moment you walk in the door and greet the receptionist, to the nurses drawing blood, to Dr. Levine you are treated like a person deserving of respect and time.  They take the time to get to know you and your partner, and that time can make all the difference in your treatment, as I will describe in subsequent sections.I felt like Dr. Talebian was in my corner throughout my fertility process. She was present and there for me during my miscarriage and during subsequent pregnancy was beyond supportive. She understood my high levels of anxiety and went out of her way to provide reassurance and extra ultrasounds during the early stages of pregnancy. I don’t know how I would have managed without her!They not only treated me like a human, they treated me like royalty.  I was in touch with them throughout the entire process, and they catered to my every need and concern (and I am a worrier so there were a lot).  Whether through patient visits, email or phone, they responded immediately and allayed whatever question/concern I had.Dr. Levine was amazing from the beginning. We had been told by another fertility specialist that we should give fertility medications only one month and then go straight to IVF. Dr. Levine was optimistic and confident from the beginning that he could get us pregnant. And he was right!Dr. Levine was extremely caring and responsive while I was in his care.  We did 2 retrieval cycles with him with full chromosomal testing.  The first cycle failed to produce any healthy embryos and we were devastated.  Dr. Levine spent a long time carefully explaining what the results meant, and also what he learned from them about our specific situation.  He gave us some recommendations for how to proceed if we wanted to cycle again, and also what he thought our chance of success would be going forward. He recommended we take time off to help us heal psychologically, and was clearly concerned with our well-being overall.

During our second cycle, he carefully monitored every step, and tweaked things as needed. He is incredibly responsive over email, and makes himself available for calls or questions regardless of whether it's a weekday or business hours. Dr. Levine is warm and friendly, and good at explaining the science behind things, which mattered to us as well.Great service in the front and back of office. They always answered the phone immediately and returned calls very quickly. Brian always called personally to deliver good and bad news. I felt like he was taking great care of me as he would a family member or friend. Brian's bedside manner is better than any fertility doctor that I have ever seen.  In our first meeting to discuss treatment options with him, he spent an hour and half going through our individual case and the approach that he was going to take while carefully explaining in layman's terms what he was talking about. I was able to access Dr Knopman anytime of the day via email which she answered very quickly. For daily monitoring, I was given an appt time so didn't have to wait for hours on end. The longest I had to wait was 10 minutes in a beautiful waiting room with a few other people, vs. hundreds that I experienced with other clinics. I saw Dr Knopman at every visit except for one. Excellent mannerisms, articulate communication and explanations. Having not much knowledge of my options when I began this process, Dr. Choi was able to specifically list all of the ways I had (medically, financially, etc) to have a child.  She always seemed honest with the percentage of successes at my age and optimistic for my success. She honored my resistance to trying IVF and also allowed for the information to sit with me should I change my mind.  I never felt judged by her, always supported by her and her staff.Dr. Talebian was accessible via email and really made me feel like she cared about me and my case.  She answered my questions promptly and treated me like a friend instead of just another number.Dr Levine is extremely personable and compassionate. His smile speaks a thousand words. More importantly, he clinically treats each case and patient uniquely. I know my protocol was designed specifically for me and my body. If I was treated like a number a customized protocol would not happen.Dr. Levine treated us with incredible kindness. I didn't feel like a number at all. The relationship between a patient and doctor grows into a friendship when you spend so much time working towards the same goal together. He spent a lot of time with us during our consultations.  He reviewed my previous records thoroughly and had good input on what our plan should be.  We were able to speak on the phone and email with him regularly.  He was very personable toward me and my husband during our visits.  Dr. Levine was beyond amazing from our first meeting, I was nervous and my husband and I were fed up with trying to get pregnant but the thought of seeing a fertility doctor was scary & also brings up “omg something is wrong” which we never wanted obviously. I remember in our first meeting Dr Levine saying “look I get it, you see everyone getting pregnant on Facebook and your like ‘why not me?!” Which is exactly how I felt a million times and I knew he actually got itDr. Choi while very knowledgeable and often serious, really did seem to care about us and the outcome of our treatment. Dr. Levine absolutely changed the way I thought about my healthcare and doctor patient relationships in general. He is the anti-paternalistic traditional doctor. I felt that we had truly partnered in my care, I was empowered and had all the information, and felt like he was my advocate. HE was also a human with me, and we had normal 2017 communications, like via email and text. It really felt like he was invested in my results and my outcome. I could not recommend any doctor in any field more highly than Dr. Levine. Not once in our entire experience with CCRM NY team and specifically Dr. Levine did we ever feel like a number.  Every interaction whether it was making an appointment, following up on a billing question, requesting directions on medications and/or most importantly the time we spent with Dr. Levine was with utmost respect, care and compassion about our specific situation.   It was always amazing to see that everyone always knew where we were in the cycle, the protocol we were following, our history and our concerns.  Dr. Levine was almost never in a rush.  He took the time to talk to us , hear us and always responded to our questions whether in person, via email or sometimes even text messages when we were nervous.   I would go as far as saying that my wife and I felt like we were the ONLY patients at CCRM because of the love, care, and time we received.   We are so grateful to Dr. Levine and his team for the journey they brought us on and the results they delivered.
&lt;I will call out that the online survey here does not allow for ""Current Active Pregnancy"".   As such we have selected Live Birth - Singleton as the option even though my wife is 11 weeks 4 days pregnant at this point&gt;Dr. Levine made me feel very comfortable. He was proactive in telling me results and next steps, and made sure I was okay with the plan before moving forward.  Dr. Choi treated me like an adult who understood what was happening, kept me candidly appraised of what was going on, and personally checked in with me repeatedly before and after appointments.Dr. Talebian always takes time to ask me about my life and how I'm doing as a human being outside of fertility issues. She's warm, caring, yet blunt and rational. The perfect fit for my style.Everyone at CCRM is kind and knows me. I never feel rushed and have never felt like I am asking too many questions.The level of personalized care was extraordinary. I felt that Dr. Choi, the nurses, and the rest of the team at CCRM were really paying attention to me and my unique situation. Dr. Levine knew every last detail about my case, my meds, my numbers, literally EVERYTHING! I saw him every time I went! If I had any questions, I would email him and he would always get back to me. He cares!Every staff member greeted me with my name & they each took the time to speak to me in a normal fashion & not rush me at each appointment. She remembers details well and is easy to get in touch with.  She explains results and procedures well and utilized the current literature in her approach and explanations. Dr Levine made himself readily available. He was very responsive to email and would personally call us back immediately whenever we called for him. Dr. Choi is excellent at communication.  She is highly cerebral in her approach, but also incredibly compassionate.  Dr. Knopman knew my situation, asked about my family during visits and was always warm and caring. She knew exactly who I was at every step. Dr. Levine is very available and extremely personable. He always runs on time and answers emails obsessively. Dr. Levine was extremely personable, very responsive to emails/phone calls, and cared about your story and why you were there.From the moment I made the appointment and first met Dr. Levine and his staff I felt immediately more at ease. The entire staff was truly amazing. It sounds weird but I actually miss seeing and chatting with the nurses everyday!Dr. Kang has always made each decision a collaborative one. She presents the options and alternatives openly and honestly. She shares her recommendations but has always remained open to my wishes and preferences. I believe that she cares a great deal about her patients as people and wants the best for them medically and personally.  Dr Choi takes the time to listen and really understand the unique situation each patient is going through. If something doesn’t work, she is relentless if finding the next thing to try. It never feels routine with her.Dr Choi truly cares about her patients.  She spent an hour and a half with me answering questions the first time we met, and didn’t hesitate to call me on Saturday or Sunday if there were results she knew I really wanted to hear.  She went above and beyond, was kind, patient, and incredible. Dr. Talebian has been wonderful. She answers your emails promptly and is very vested in the success of your treatment.He is the best doctor I've seen on my long journey. Explains the details, is honest about the actual chances, very knowledgeable and does everything to give the patient the best outcome possible.Dr. Levine was so warm and compassionate during the entire process. We felt like we were very well taken care of, and not at all like a number. He is very helpful, especially in tough situations.I felt like I was talking to an old friend when I first went in to meet Janet. I had been through this twice before and she could tell I didn’t need to go through every thing step by step again. It was a fantastic experienceDr. Talebian is very attentive, kind, smart, patient and honest.Five star boutique service is what you can expect atSisirm. From the very first visit, dr Levine put me atease and explained the whole process slowly andpatiently, answering my many questions. The entirestaff was friendly and accommodating at all times.We were successful after the first try and we welcomed our little princess just a few weeks ago.
Dr. Knopman was always accessible, she answered my questions in a timely manner and gave me her honest advice.At the first consult Dr. Levine was patient and methodical with his approach toward me and continued this approach until I became pregnant successfully. He provided all of his personal contact information to me at the first consult and answered every email/phone call I ever made to him within minutes/hours. Dr Janet Choi was so detail oriented and patient. She always called with results and took time to explain next steps. She is a thoughtful doctor and a pleasure to work with.Dr. Choi treated me with the utmost compassion and respect. I have never found a doctor that listened to me like Dr. Choi. She would go above and beyond to make me feel at ease. Dr. Choi called me to explain every result.  She was beyond thorough and understands that fertility is a science as well as an Art.  She is extremely dedicated to her craft as well as her patients and cares for them as if they were family.Dr. Levine personally returned my calls and emails, answered my questions, and offers alternative treatments. There was always someone to immediately answer the phone upon calling, the waiting room time was always less than 5 minutes. Every single nurse was very good and easy to work with. The doctors were thoughtful and familiar, and all knew my entire story.

We felt like a colleagues more than patients and appreciated that very much. Brian Levine & the staff at CCRM do an incredible job of making you feel like you are an important part of their family.  From the first visit office staff, nurses, and doctors make you feel like an individual with your own story and that they want to see you succeed.  
I can't say enough how wonderful it was, and still is, to have the ability to directly contact Brian and our nurses and know that we will get a personal response back.Dr. Levine understands what a tough process this is for couples. He remains positive throughout the process while still keeping expectations in line. He readily answers emails and phone. Dr Levine was very attentive, provided personalized care. He listened to us and would always remember things that were stated in previous conversations. From the very beginning, we felt like he truly cared about helping us arrive at a successful outcome. He wanted us to conceive and was extremely positive every step of the wayDr Levine uses a combination of data and personalization when thinking about each patients care. I was never treated like a number and always received personal attention from him and the nurses. He is incredibly smart and i trusted him every step of the way. The office is beautiful and comfortable. The nurses are so warm and know you by name. I can’t thank the entire staff enoughDr. Levine has got to be the most amazing doctor I have ever seen. Infertility is a trying and difficult process—and Dr. Levine goes above and beyond for his patients, both to treat the issue physically, but also checking in on how they're coping emotionally. Not only do I trust him 100%, but he truly cares about you as a patient.  I am over the moon impressed with Dr Levine’s explanation and bedside manner- he is able to be kind and direct while also exhibiting the highest level of confidence and safety - 
Felt emotionally connected to doctor and staff",9.7,9.5,"We did a bit of research on Fertility IQ before choosing a clinic & doctor and were not disappointed by our choice. He is direct, which I appreciate on a daily basis. When our case became complicated, she justified proposed treatments with anecdotal stories instead of studies. She was so thorough and really took the time to get to know me and explain the process fully. As I developed thyroid issues early in my pregnancy he recommended a great list of endocrinologists that I could choose from, based on my health insurance coverage and preference. She was confident and knowledge about IVF ...I never felt as if the transfer wouldn't work and if I did have doubts she had solutions and reassuring words that helped ease my worry. He is very well versed on the fertility literature and studies and as such, he is able to offer both the most successful protocols and able to tweak them slightly to improve our success. Dr. Levine took the time to get to know us and my wife both on a medical level and a personal level – what is my wife’s medical history, but also, what drives us, what do we like to do for fun, etc...  We thought we were visiting with a friend. He is an extremely positive individual and extraordinarily dedicated to his patients. I also appreciated the fact that when the news she had to give wasn't the best, she was very rational and discussed all the options with us. Dr. Talebian is extremely thorough and kind. He totally understands us and takes a human centered approach to our care. The process was smooth and easy and I can hands down say I think that CCRM NY is the best fertility clinic in NYC.She does a comprehensive evaluation and on the first visit she ran a test where it was discovered my prolactin was sky high. From our very first meeting with Dr Talabian, my partner and I felt that she was very kind and honest about what the IVF process would be like and what our chances were. LEVINE TOOK TIME TO EXPLAIN OUR OPTIONS AND ALWAYS ANSWERED MY QUESTIONS, NEVER FELT RUSHED & WAS COMPASSIONATE ABOUT MY SITUATION.Dr Knopman listened to what we had experienced at another clinic, gave feed back, ideas and plans from the first time we met. From our first consult, Dr. Talebian was able to give us her past experience at working at other NYC clinics (like RMA who we had previously went to) and describe in a very sensitive way how CCRM operates a little differently and her approach for my treatment. I felt like Dr. Talebian was in my corner throughout my fertility process. Dr. Choi treated me like an adult who understood what was happening, kept me candidly appraised of what was going on, and personally checked in with me repeatedly before and after appointments. I can't say enough how wonderful it was, and still is, to have the ability to directly contact Brian and our nurses and know that we will get a personal response back. I was never treated like a number and always received personal attention from him and the nurses."
36,CCRM New York,advice,"Do your own research and homework outside of your treatment recommendations, more for your own understanding.  Come to the table with some knowledge of fertility/infertility.  I could imagine not knowing anything someone might feel overwhelmed (in general).  She explains well, but you'll maximize the depth of her knowledge better.  She's extremely smart and good at what she does.  Come to her with your own thoughts, questions.  Dr. Choi speaks quickly, pay attention to her answers (take notes if possible). Bring any and all questions you have! He will answer them with insight and thoughtfulness. Nothing is off limits, too personal or too medical. He is also great to just chat about life and how things are with you, so don't be afraid to be personal. He really does want to get to know you as a human being. Don't feel the need to rush the meeting because you think he needs to go! He will take his time with you unless some emergency comes up. (has only happened once in a year!) When you leave and forget to ask something, just email him. He will respond within a few days.Be prepared to speak up and advocate for yourself.  I think Dr Knopman genuinely wants the best for all of her patients, but I suspect she is just super busy.  Don't be the patient who gets shortchanged and demand the time/answers you need.  Understand that CCRM is a community that he is running. Brian might not be there for every ultrasound but the other Doctors will be and they are all great. Be open to the process and be realistic about the treatment.  A lot of working through infertility is figuring out what works for your specific situation and Dr. Knopman will be a fantastic ally in that journey. Describe your situation and history with details and Dr. Talebian will make sure to adjust the protocol accordingly. Have all of your questions ready because she is fast; she is in and out of the room when you go in for scans and you should be prepared with everything you want to discuss. I would also say never hesitate to email her, she will always get back to you.To come prepared with questions and thoughts because Dr. T will hold the space to answer EVERYTHING that comes across your mind. Take questions and ask as many questions as you can. She's very insightful - so you can learn a lot.The team at CCRM and Dr Talabian are great. That said, the patient still really needs to be on top of her own meds, as well as be very clear with the insurance company. There are so many hoops that you have to go through. Be in charge of your meds, be in touch with the clinic, ask a lot of questions, and you will get the help you need. But you the patient need to be primarily responsible for the drugs, and there are a lot of them!Go see Dr. Knopman! Come prepared with a list of questions and be ready to ask them all!Trust in her and don't be afraid to ask questions or for an explanation of how things work. She is super knowledgeable and knowing the facts will help reassure you.If you have any questions Dr. Levine always provides great answers & makes sure you understand. If you forget any questions during a visit you can always reach out by email and he will get back to you promptly.Dr. Knopman runs monitoring appointments on Tuesday mornings. On other mornings her fellow Drs will see you and are all great. Dr. Knopman will answer all your questions and refer you specialists to gain more incite to your health. I really appreciated her point of view and partnership in finding new solutions for my fertility journey. Come with questions- she will answer all of them.Be armed with questions before appointments. The office appointments are the best time to be able to discuss with her directly so it’s important to be prepared. Don’t look at any other practice, go to CCRM and see Dr. Choi.Give her all the details and be open and honest with your treatment expectations. She may not always say what you'd like to hear but you feel validated that she has reviewed your information and is giving you the best options to a possible new approach Tell her as much as you can -- every piece of information can help! and they want to know! Trust the process. It may not always work the first try. We had 3 failed IUI, but Dr Levine’s plan worked and I was pregnant within 9 months of my first visit to CCRM NY. Trust in his plan for you as he is the absolute best. Understand that she is not warm and fuzzy. She is direct, thorough and transparent. If you need a warm and fuzzy doctor, she isn't the right fit for you. Know that you need to do your research and understand your case and continue to educate yourself along the way. Direct beats unrealistic expectations in my book. If you’re considering seeing a fertility specialist, do not hesitate to give CCRM (and Dr. Levine in particular) a chance. GO GO GO see her if you want a baby!I would say to be open and honest about everything, even if you don't think it makes any difference.  Lay it all out on the table, the Doc will never judge you.  Figure out the best line of communication early on.Don't take moving into fertility treatment lightly. Do your research and find a doctor and clinic you are comfortable with. It can take months or years to be successful and you want to be sure you have the right team behind you. My only mistake was not going to see CCRM first!Take optimism with a grain of salt. Advocate for yourself a lot in terms of timing that you prefer for an FET and learn more about changes re the treatment of other existing conditions that are maybe being changed  during course of a cycle. tell her how much communication you want to receive - how involved you want to be in knowing the whys/whats of your fertility journeyHe is great and CCRM NY is great. He is always very positive-- so keep that in mind and try not to get your hopes up too much. Trust him he’s good at his job!Don't see another doctor. Give yourself permission to slow down / relax during appointments and take the time to build a personal relationship with Dr. Levine. It will make an already incredible experience that much more amazing. Also, don't be afraid to ask questions or talk about how you're feeling. Dr. Levine is incredibly responsive, and you should never leave an appointment feeling like you're unclear on any part of his assessment or don't know the plan. Please run, don't walk, to see Dr. Levine and CCRM NY.  He will treat you as if you are family.  He takes the time to understand your condition and develop the treatment  protocol that is best for you.  Jamie is there for you throughout the whole process. She did all my scans and my retrieval. She is really accessible and communicative. Anything that came up throughout the process, I would email her and get an almost immediate response. Jamie is also real and honest. She wants to do what is best for her patients, but makes it clear the reality of the situation. She has so much fun experience and knowledge that she was always dead on with what she told me! When I asked her about doing another round of egg freezing, she was honest and told me to wait a year and see where my life is then. She said this process can get addicting, to take time and enjoy life. When I went back a year, Based on blood tests, age, ultrasound and I asked her what to do, she said if it was me this is a no brainer-I would 100% do it. I know she was never trying to put me through another round if I didn’t have to and truly trusted her insight when she said to do it. She is in this field because it is a passion of hers and she wants the best for each patient and not for other superficial reasons that other doctors practice for. Go for it!Not much needed. I say this for everyone undergoing IVF - be your own advocate. but that's not specific to sheevaDon't be afraid to ask a ton of questions. She has never made me feel rushed, and she's happy to go through things in a bunch of different ways. Know that you may not always hear what you want to hear but that you have to have faith in the process and believe that he is doing all he can for you.Manage your own expectations and be prepared with questions. He'll happily answer them until you feel comfortable! Ask lots of questions.  He'll have the answers and it will put your mind at ease.  She is with out a doubt one of the best when it comes to fertility Drs. She is a joy to work with. Whoever is her patient is very lucky to be working with her.To be ready to be treated like the sole patient of the entire office. That is how you feel at CCRM with Dr. Choi.Even though treatment at CCRM is expensive, it is worth every last penny.

It is important for Dr. Levine to know that you are personally engaged in the process.   However, don't push your own method or agenda based on your research.  Dr. Levine is experienced, knowledgeable and has done thousands of retrievals and transfers.   Don't read into his youthfulness and positivism any more than he always you to leave happy from his office (no matter how hard the circumstances).   He knows what he is doing, is advised by a very strong team and will keep your interests in mind.Dr. Levine treats each patient based on their own circumstances, so feel comfortable that you are getting individualized care.

Be completely open and honest with Dr Levine. He has only your interests in mind.  He personally explains everything, and does everything to accommodate your questions and concerns. Dr. Choi tells it like it is.  She is not one to sugarcoat information, but she also spends time to explain what happened, and what she would do differently having learned from the previous cycle.  Dr. Knopman is thorough and attentive, and you're in good hands with CCRM in general. undertsand that his heart is in teh right place, but you are always going to hear the ""glass half full"" explanation- regardless of statistics and odds. Do not waste your time with other doctors, go straight to Brian right away.  Also, I know the fact that insurance may or may not cover you is scary, but it is worth it to see Brian.Take a deep breath and trust in the process. Educate yourself but also don't overwhelm yourself with the copious internet blogs. Allow yourself to trust in the experience and care of CCRM. My advice is not to be afraid to ask questions. She is very willing to answer them, and you are paying a lot, so you should ask whatever you need to in order to feel like you understand everything. Don’t hesitate, work with her! You are lucky to have found her!  She is not always warm and fuzzy in every conversation because she’s so busy, but when it counts it is clear that she cares.

37,CCRM New York,nurse,"Julie was UNBELIEVABLE - I actually want to be her friend.  She responded to every single email, call, voicemail calmly and gave me so much information, always so empathetic.  She even followed up with me multiple times unprovoked.  I loved JulieI actually cried on my last day at CCRM because the staff had been SO kind with every single visit (and there are a lot). This is NOT the case at RMA...where half the time everyone just seemed miserable to be there. The nursing staff is all friendly and kind. They're also quick to respond to questions via the online portal, no matter how small or potentially silly. Jamie was a wonderful nurse to work with. She always answered any question I had within 2 hours. Was very informative, compassionate, and friendly. She facilitated and resolved any communication issues I would have with the pharmacy and/or insurance company.I had a one on one medication consult that included demonstrations on how to give the shots.  This was incredibly helpful.  All of the nursing staff were warm, friendly, easy going and very knowledgeable.  All emails / calls were answered quickly and thoroughly. The nurses helped me SO much throughout my time with them and throughout the process. I had a ton of questions and they were always getting back to me right away! She was reassuring and explained everything in detail as this was all new to me.Liz, Jamie and Hunter are fantastic. Questions and instructions are always clearly communicated. they are all knowledgeable, compassionate and caring.  very highly experienced staffHunter and the staff are amazing - very organized, responsive and thorough.All of the nurses were excellent. Information was thorough and delivered in a timely manner. WONDERFUL. Extremely timely with lab results, very responsive via the portal, and always available to review treatment plans after visits. I was never without a refill or concrete plan. Each visit was followed by an email with clear instructions. Always available to answer questions. Very friendly. Competent Jamie Walsh was like a burst of sunshine in a very difficult time for us!  Learning we would need to use donor eggs was a difficult pill to swallow but having Jamie assigned our coordinator made the process much less scary & difficult - I can't say enough good things about her.  We love her!
The entire nursing staff at CCRM become like family - you spend A LOT of time with these women and they all do a great job of making you feel special!Dr Choi's primary Nurse, Emily, was very competent as well.  Once we were working with her during the IVF cycle, we felt much more assure we were in good hands.  She was always organized when we saw her and was always quick to reply thru the patient portal.
We did have have some back and forth discrepancies with the patient care coordinator and the financial coordinator during the testing working up and before moving forward with the pricing/decided treatment.  Sometimes we felt things got tacked on that we didn't ask for.  I can imagine some people pay for services that aren't needed.  We really had to advocate for ourselves that what were getting and paying for only what we wanted.  The nursing staff at CCRM were absolute rockstars.  They were efficient, professional and always uplifting.  We are so grateful to them for their fantastic care and their kind words. They were an amazing support system during a process that can be very difficult. They were ALL extremely organized, on top of things and communicative. At my last clinic I felt like I had to be my own advocate and keep track of everything whereas at CCRM most of it was done for me. They were always two steps ahead. They are also all incredibly kind and caring.I would say most of the time the nursing staff was good a communication. I would have preferred if it was one nurse we were communicating, rather than several, because sometimes it seemed they weren't familiar with the case. My only complaint is that I never actually met my dedicated nurse in person. That said, on monitoring days I regularly met with many of the other nurses and was able to ask them any questions I had. My nurse was always very responsive to email questions - literally within a few hours, if not minutes of my outreach. Nursing staff and the entire team was excellent. Went out of their way to be friendly, call you by name, ask how you were doing and feeling. Can't say enough good things.Elana, Liz, Jenny, Stephanie, & embryologist were exceptional. They are all extremely organized, tentative, got back to me always right away answered all my questions. They all really made a stressful process less stressful & made things easier for me which helped me so much during this process.I feel communication and organization is a weak point for the coordinators. Since I have been through several cycles (at another clinic) I knew what to expect at the steps along the way. I found myself asking the nurses and coordinator for information that they should have been telling me. I was giving them personal information twice because they said they didn't have it (but I had given to someone else) One visit they thought I was only getting blood, no sonogram and only knew I needed the sonogram because I said something. Even after discussing it they thought I was on a different day of stims. All instructions are emailed through their portal which is very nice to not be on edge waiting for a phone and thinking you might miss it. It is easy to print the email and then have a checklist of meds until your next visit. The only set back is if when you don't get a message. Once I called because it was 4:30 and I still hadn't gotten my instructions. The nurse said she already sent it and I just didn't receive. So you still have to be on top of that.
Although their are a few setbacks overall the staff is very friendly and willing to help.Nursing team was excellent. Extremely responsive to questions both through the online portal and over the phone. The nursing staff is amazing - led by Lori, they personally take time to learn your name, and always greet you with a smile and a simple ""hi how are you doing today"" (which is more than at many other clinics) Since I have been there for a while, the nurses now know that although my veins can be challenging they know exactly how to get it done efficiently (there was even a new nurse drawing my blood, and Lori came over to show her where is the best place on my arm) We also worked with Jamie Walsh who was great with emails and contact Great communication throughout our time at CCRM! Jaime was incredible she like Dr. Talebian made me feel like a VIP....she explained the steps, set up my calendar and made everything easy!Jenny was awesome! She was easily accessible for any questions I had, always had our timelines organized and was very accommodating with our requestsThe nurses are very good. They promptly reply to emails through the patient portal, including on weekends. Explanations are usually clear, but if not, reaching them for clarification is very easy. They're very good about calling in meds ASAP. The nurses as CCRM have been pleasant and prompt. They helped me track down medication, figured out billing, and let us use extra testing syringes to test what it feels like to give a shot. The only flub happened during our first appointment when they had both of our names wrong. The last thing you want at a fertility clinic is to get someone else's name on your paperwork or sample!NOt much to describe. so much direct communication with the doctor directly that the nurses so far have been additive but not as highly needed as at cornellThe nursing staff at CCRM is amazing. They're friendly and competent, and readily available. Every nurse, phlebotomist and staff member at CCRM was excellent. Every nurse I saw was helpful, compassionate, knowledgable and available. I appreciated all of their help so much and felt that they really became invested in my care. The rest of the staff is wonderful as well - always helpful, warm and accommodating. I felt like everyone at CCRM knew me and were rooting for me.  All of the CCRM nurses are very well versed in fertility treatments.  If I had questions, they always knew the answers (or would go find them out -- even speaking to the embryologists to get accurate answers).  They were able to explain why I needed some medications over others.  They answered all phone calls by the end of business day.  When I needed to pick medications up at other pharmacies, the nurses were expeditious in calling in the medications.  The OR nurses were very empathetic -- my egg retrieval was on a cold January Monday and the nurses warmed up the bed for me so I wouldn't feel cold.  The front desk staff is very warm and friendly.   They knew my name and were very friendly both in the office and on phone calls.  They were very helpful in making appointments that worked with my schedule.  Lastly, the phlebotomists, especially Lori, were wonderful.  She always asked me how I was feeling and I felt like she was my biggest cheerleader for me at every appointment. 
Liz was always very responsive to emails and helped coordinate sending prescriptions to different pharmacies depending on where my husband or I were that was convenient for us. Hunter was the by far the best nurse I have ever had throughout the fertility process. She is smart, compassionate, organized and very positive making the journey much more tolerable. Jamie my nurse was so wonderful.  She was very accessible and made sure I understood every step of my cycle.  She answered emails quickly when I had questions and was very encouraging.THE BEST in the industry. As are all the nurses at CCRM. Hunter was my consultant, my rock and my guide through this journey.The nursing staff is the friendliest I've experienced between 2 different clinics. They are easy to get a hold of which is SO important! The nurse, care coordinator is a crucial part of the team and the process as you go through an IVF cycle.  At CCRM we found the staff to highly professional, well trained, caring and most importantly very responsive to all our questions.   The nurses always took the time to explain the treatment, laid out a specific calendar customized just for my wife, and did a great job of giving us instructions based on her blood work after each visit.  

I really can't think of any weaknesses.   On occasion the timing of instructions could get a little delayed because they received the blood from us late and/or it was very busy.   However, they maintained a very high standard of always getting us instructions for treatment every day.   

As anyone who has been thru this journey would tell you - needles become your close friends, and often an unnerving part of the process.  The nurses at CCRM showed us and even at times administered the shot for my wife so i can see and then follow at home.   

When my wife finally got a positive result, the team at CCRM reached out personally and congratulated her and gave her very warm greetings.   It just goes out to show that these are people who really love what they do and want every patient to go home with the results they want.   They make each patient feel like they are the only ones at CCRM.

The best part about this team was that they all backed each other up and everyone knew our history and our protocol.   There were 4-5 nurses but each of them knew our case, and any one of them could answer our questions.   That was tremendous.  It also helped if any one person was out of office. I think Hunter was my primary nurse, however I spoke to Dr. Levine in person and over the phone more than I spoke to any nurse. Hunter was great, though!! So nice and welcoming. They would always meet with me when I had questions.Every nursing staff member was excellent.Nursing staff was amazing. Everyone was polite, friendly, compassionate.  The staff at CCRM are highly professional and very well organized.  Given it's a smaller clinic, they know your name when you arrive for an appointment.The entire nursing staff was so friendly, compassionate and truly exceptional. I felt at ease through the entire process. Julie and the entire nursing staff are amazing. They are so kind and welcoming and very efficient. The nurses are simply amazing. So personal and helpful. I felt like I was in the best hands with them. They were super responsive and comforting.They all had me laughing and were easy to get ahold of if I had any questions.Jenny is fantastic. She is warm, positive, knowledgeable and readily available to answer any questions or concerns We felt we received very personalized assistance. Everyone was warm, caring, knowledgable with very positive energyAmazing!",9.7,9.5,Julie was UNBELIEVABLE - I actually want to be her friend. so much direct communication with the doctor directly that the nurses so far have been additive but not as highly needed as at cornellThe nursing staff at CCRM is amazing. She was very accessible and made sure I understood every step of my cycle.
38,CCRM New York,clinic,"Every time I went into the clinic for blood work and ultrasounds, the nurses were always gentle, efficient and had the biggest smiles on their faces. Whenever I had blood taken, it was always a painless experience and over very quickly. I always had such a warm experience with all of the team at CCRM NY and always looked forward to seeing them on my visits to the clinic. They are such a wonderful team and a credit to CCRM, without exception. The nursing staff was amazing. They were always available to help answer any questions and emailed me my instructions in a timely manner each day. Whenever I encountered them at the office, they were always helpful and pleasant.Perfect clinic from start to finish - clean, friendly, always on time, never judgmental and gets you in and out.  I never waited for more than 10 minutes and seeing the nurses was usually a highlight of my day because they were so nice and friendly.  Also never waited for Dr. T for more than 10 mins and they were always able to accommodate my appt times so I was able to go before work every single time.  All around amazing! 










eThis clinic was so easy to deal with. Scheduling was a breeze, they were so accommodating. I work full time as a pediatric dentist and they were always able to give me the time and the doctor I needed to see. The front desk always answers the phone and never makes you wait. You are able to talk to a nurse whenever you need to. The appointments time are quick and painless! You never wait more than 10 min. The whole experience was A+So nice and clean and beautiful.  Great views.  Luna bars.  Water.  and on time and always return your calls, emails.................,................................................................................................................................I only have good things to say about the clinic. From my first visit, I felt like I was going into a safe and familiar place. There were never long waiting times, everywhere is always immaculate and has a really friendly atmosphere as soon as I walk in. The receptionist are extremely accommodating and efficient, and it’s always a pleasure to see them as I arrive into the clinic. All aspects of CCRM NY met my expectations, and more. The women who do morning monitoring (particularly blood draws) are truly the best part of this clinic.  They are so kind and compassionate.  I genuinely looked forward to seeing them.  With rare exception, the doctor's nurses were also wonderful and very friendly.  Occasionally prescriptions did not get called in, but they seemed pretty on top of it.  I've heard horror stories of nurses at other clinics and you won't get any of that here.  You might like one more than another, but they are all caring, component and pleasant.  The nursing staff was extremely accessible.  They would reach out to me within minutes of me writing to them through the portal or calling them. They were caring, compassionate, educated, and extremely helpful.They were great and always ready to help. Blood draws were a breeze and I dislike needles. Some knew me by name and made me feel like they were part of my journey. They knew where I was in my cycle and encouraged me to be positive. It helped make the process more human. The nursing staff was incredibly responsive to me.  Any question or concern I had was answered within a few hours.  The instructions given were clear and easy to understand.  Every nurse I encountered was exceptional.I was OBSESSED with all of the nurses.  When I was gearing up from the egg retrieval, they sat down with me and my husband for over an hour to talk about the dosage and administration of each medication.  It can be intimidating - but they instill so much confidence in you, that all of my anxiety dissipated. Always compassionate.  Always respectful.  Very very competent.  I truly miss them! They were beyond competent, and so so lovely. Everyone there seems like they had a personality/culture fit test. There is seriously not a single bad egg, bad mood, or bad attitude person there. CCRM NY is amazing! Everyone from the front desk staff to all of the doctors far exceeded my expectations. Dr. Levine was my doctor but all of the staff and doctors knew me by first name and always showed a genuine interest in my progress and care. After having gone to a different clinic, it was night and day with CCRM being the absolute best! Even after being discharged to an OB, Dr. Levine continued the answer my questions without hesitation and in a very timely fashion. The facility itself is state of the art and super clean. Overall, I would highly recommend Dr. Levine and the entire CCRM NY team to anyone looking for top notch treatment.CCRM waiting room is like a nice hotel lobby. The women at the front desk know you by first name and you have to make appointments for monitoring hours so it’s not overflowing with women/a warehouse like many other places in the city. The women who take your blood are so sweet and good, I never felt the needle. All the nurses were extremely, nice, caring, and helpful as well. Bottom line, do not waste your money or time anywhere else!They are incredibly organized and compassionate. We love working with them to figure out what’s next. They’ve also been incredible about problem solving when life situations (eg travel) might interfere with treatment.They respond quickly to questions by email.  They are also available to speak in the office or on the phone. The nurses were fine, they seemed a little busy. Not as amazing as the doctors The clinic is beautiful and well organized and calm. But it is the quality and experience of the doctors and the lab are what distinguish the clinic from the others. The strategies and methodologies are state of the art. The cost is very high as the clinic does not take insurance and the overall cost is higher in any case.Clean, calming, never too crowded, super friendly and did a great job to create an easy time.  I can’t think of any weaknesses.  I have been to NYU and a very concierge boutique clinic in the past - CCRM was the BEST lab, the least expensive and the easiest to navigate, with the best nurses and doctors. The clinic is top of the line in every aspect, from the waiting area to the equipment and the patient rooms. The clinic has the unique ability to make you feel as if you are their only patient. Everyone in the office will know your name. The location is easy to get to and accessible, just a few minutes from Times Square. Very friendly and kindGreat views, good snacks, never had to wait. Would regularly get there and do bloods and be on my way in under 5 mins. Midtown location next to a subway. Access on the weekend a bit tough but it is the weekend. Enjoyed going there, receptionists very friendly.This clinic was very prompt, maintained hours to be able to undergo treatment and have a full time job, and everyone was very thorough and prompt with following up. Whether it was scheduling appointments or giving results everything was executed extremely wellCCRM NY is super organized and operates like a boutique - high touch service, quick response, short wait times. I can speak with a person every time I call. My emails to my nurse or anyone at the clinic is responded to the same day (business days). The clinic itself is pleasant, never crowded. I never feel like I'm just a number when I interact with the clinic or its staff. Nursing staff was generally great and emailed quickly with test results. But occasionally they weren't sure what I was there for or didn't clearly communicate time-sensitive medication instructions by email, maybe in part because it was always different nurses.They were so warm and responsive. They know you by name and root for you every step of the wayCCRM is, as far as I am concerned, the only place that people should go to get care for infertility. I've seen all the doctors there and each one is fantastic. As a new patient, the only question you should be asking is how soon can you make an appointment. The nursing staff is fantastic. They greet you in the lobby with a smile and genuine concern for how you are. The women you take your blood are fast. Trust me, from someone who faints, they are quick, kind and in and out! The nurses for the ultrasound are smart and efficient. The IVF nurses are also kind and answer all questions efficiently. I will urge you to stay on top of your own medical care. As wonderful as the nurses and providers are, things can get missed. Be proactive about asking questions when you either don't understand or think they gave you conflicting information. I had to inform them several times about a medication allergy which was fine; there are a lot of nurses and they share your medical information between them. I have learned to be patient while one nurse might not be up to speed.The clinic is beautiful and monitoring is a breeze. Almost everyone there will know your name.  This makes the process of going through IVF so much more pleasant.  That said, we came here based on the stellar reputation of CCRM and we quickly realized we were at CCRM New York, not CCRM Colorado.  It became clear after having a consult with Dr. Schoolcraft at CCRM Colorado that they are doing things differently there.  For one, while CCRM NY offers acupuncture, they never once mentioned the benefits of complementary therapy (supplements, acupuncture, etc.)  and even seemed to poo poo it.  They market themselves as a super personal and they are in the sense they know you, but medically speaking it feels a little bit like a factory.  I don't think I got any more of a personalized approach there than I would have at any other major NY clinic.   The nurses are all so kind and caring. You really get to know them. They remember you and are encouraging if you ever have a bad day or a struggling with emotions. The nursing staff is very friendly and get to know you personally. They don’t treat you like a number, are patient and responsive. SO friendly and capable. Even though I was experiencing a lot of stress and anxiety during the cycle, they always put me at ease and met my nerves with a warm calming presence.  They also thoughtfully answered my questions every time I was in the office and offered hands on tutorials any time a new drug was introduced. The nursing staff was amazing. At first, I wasn't sure how I felt about not dealing directly with Dr. Knopman, but the nursing staff immediately calmed any uncertainty I had. They used a portal system for communications and were very attentive and responded quickly to any questions I had. The phlebotomists were great and the nursing team contacted me with my results about 4 hours post appointment with any adjustments or guidelines for my injections.Everyone I have met has taken time to sit and answer questions. They’ve been friendly and well versed on procedures. The nursing staff was great as well. They communicated when they said they would and were always available to answer any questions. I also had one of the nurses coming to help me with injections nightly and she was so nice, she really went out of her way to help me!Great staff and doctors at CCRM NY. Frankly, because they dont take insurance, they not nearly as busy...This might change but what this means is it doesn't feel like a ""factory"" like others (this is how I felt at RMA). The nursing staff at CCRM is all star. They have excellent hours to accommodate work schedules (I did most appointments before 9am). They do a fabulous job communicating clearly and efficiently through the portal. For all complicated medications they did demos etc. they show a lot of compassion and are very kind. The most caring and amazing clinic.  From the moment you walk in the door, you know you are in a great and caring facility.  The team doesn't make you feel like a number.  You are greeted by name and they are always timely and willing to work with you on appointment times.  I flew in from Florida for all my appointments and they constantly made sure I had everything I needed.  The team of embryologists were extremely wonderful. There isn't one weakness of this clinic.Strengths: Lab, Accessibility, Finance Department, Care, Ease to correspondence, Nurse staff, front desk staff, embryology team
Weakness: Open-mindedness to changing protocols, they have their routine protocols and start everyone with the same generic protocol. Could have also used more help in finding outside resources and reading materials. The staff at CCRM NY became like our morning coffee clutch.  We shared stories, hopes, worries, smiles and tears.  They new us by the sound of our voice when we called in and we called A LOT, but they never cared.  We would always apologize for calling with so many questions and they always assured us that we could call as many times as we needed to feel comfortable.  We never felt like a number, which was very important to us.  They were gentle with the hundreds of times they took blood and thank goodness because I am extremely squeamish. It was actually bitter sweet when we walked out of there on week 10, so happy to be pregnant, but sad to be saying good bye to a staff that we had spent so much time with.The nursing staff were kind and efficientTHE AMAZING NURSING STAFF OF CCRM! Truly an integral part of the amazing care we had at CCRM.  Specifically,  I worked most with Liz, Elana and Melissa;  but they all were outstanding nurses.  They are smart, caring, and just amazing people. They really began to feel like family. Truly taking wonderful care of us!  They took the time to make sure each step was carefully understood,  ALWAYS available by email or call, Even checking on us after our procedure.  Dr. Levine was always praising his team, because they deserve it! We don't know how we could've done this without them.Some were much better than others about communicating but I had a panic attack the day of my transfer because they had written conflicting instructions and I thought I had taken progesterone shot on wrong day at last minute. This is a well run clinic and that really helped take the additional stress off  the process. I never had to wait more than 10 min for my appts and as a busy professional that made such a difference as I was able to better balance work and treatment. Even the receptionists were helpful and were able to answer questions not just schedule appointments. I never felt like I was just a number and coming from two other clinics that always had numerous patients waiting sometimes over an hour to be seen, CCRM was truly a breath of fresh air. Customer service is a real strength of this clinic. You feel like a person and not a number. While I almost predominantly dealt with my doctor, Dr. Levine, I occasionally encountered the other doctors in the practice through morning monitoring and I thought everyone was kind and professional. Also, they take appointments for morning monitoring, so even though they don't always move as quickly as you'd like, it's much better than just showing up, putting your name in the queue and having no idea how long you'll be sitting there. As I've mentioned, Dr. Levine was the best, but his nursing staff was even more the best. I know they see a lot of patients, but I was floored every time they recognized me and greeted me by name. They were so friendly and wonderful and reassuring, whether drawing blood, explaining how to inject my Ovidrel trigger shot, or calling me to make sure I knew the next steps. They were also the best cheerleaders and the best coaches when you didn't get the results you wanted. Also, when I found out I was pregnant, I could feel the support of the nursing staff -- they all congratulated me and made me feel so special. Without question, CCRM NY is an amazing place.  After having a failed cycle elsewhere, I did my research and found CCRM NY and Dr. Levine.  I traveled 1,000+ miles, and it was well worth it.  I never had to wait more than five minutes for an appointment.  Ever.  My initial consultation lasted hours.  I was given full details regarding my prognosis, and a treatment plan.  Dr. Levine and the staff at CCRM NY are passionate about what they do.  Thanks to the team, I am now 31 weeks pregnant with my first child, and have banked additional CCS-tested embryos.  My results with CCRM NY were dramatically improved from my first cycle.  I attribute this to Dr. Levine's customized protocol, the amazing embryologists and lab, nursing staff, and the receptionists there.  From the bottom of my heart, thank you.The personal care, attention , dedication and passion of the nursing staff are CCRM NY is unlike any doctors office I’ve ever been to. They are truly there for you throughout the whole process and care about your health and success. They are on your side the whole time! They also are so warm, positive, friendly and treat everyone in that manner. They are kind and non competitive with one another and you can tell they love working there and what they do.The nursing staff at CCRM is top notch. They are quick without making you feel rushed, but most of all, they are super kind and compassionate and always greet you with a smile. Whenever I would walk into CCRM, the front desk staff, especially Stephanie and Gina, would always welcome me with a smile and by my name. I felt like I was a hotel guest and not a patient. I never waited more than 10 minutes for an appointment, whether is was for blood tests or meeting with Dr. Choi. Even Amanda in billing was great to work with. She was always a pleasure to work with.Everyone at CCRM was great. Always available to answer any questions (and trust me, this process initiates MANY questions!)One aspect that should be highlighted overlooked are the women who sit at the front desk, scheduling appointments and doing patient intake. They are so sweet, incredibly organized, and always ""make it work"" to accommodate your schedule.  
Also, the facilities are beautiful and quite calming - no detail is overlooked.
The entire experience was positive.  The space was intentionally designed to be low profile and respect the privacy of the patients.  the space is clean and calming.  Every detail was thought of an addressed here.  There was never a crowd in the waiting area and everyone took the time to get to know us and provide care in the best possible manner.Overall, the nursing staff was incredible and supportive. There was one point where information was not provided and I had to reach out to Dr. Talebian for clarification.The nursing staff was amazing-- they also catered to my every need and were always so friendly and positive and immediately knew me by name.  They were also extremely responsive via email and the portal to every question/concern I had.The nursing staff was kind and responsive. They provided good education regarding medication and how to administer it. They get to know you as a person and genuinely care about your treatment and how you're doing.

The nursing staff sometimes struggles drawing blood (though, to be fair, I have notoriously difficult veins).  In addition, sometimes the communication regarding drug changes and refills had to be initiated by me instead of by them.  I only saw one nurse during the few months I was there. She was always sweet, remembered us and knew to use the small needle on me for bloodwork. She was also very optimistic and wished us good luck on the IUIs. The nursing staff at CCRM is highly competent and completely compassionate with your situation.  Obviously people would prefer not to be at a fertility clinic because it means there is some problem involved with procreation.  The nursing staff is aware of this and makes the experience as painless as possible.The clinic is well run and brand new - so it's clean and modern.  My experiences were all positive. 

The only downside is they have not yet started taking insurance yet.  Although the billing office is very willing to work with you on reimbursements and things. The nurses were always super kind, even when it took so long to find a vein to draw blood.  They answered my emails regarding any question on the injections I was taking. The nursing staff was absolutely incredible! This was another big reason why we went with CCRM. They were compassionate and very responsive to any questions I had. I always felt like I was safe and taken care of. Thank you to all the wonderful nurses and all the hard work that they do!Initially I thought I was assigned a nurse to work with but in the end got calls and communication from various nurses.  The patient portal is the main way to communicate with the nurses but I did not find that it was very efficient.  The nursing staff was amazing, they would know what we were coming in for before even calling us from the waiting room. I remember coming in for bloodwork to confirm my pregnancy and the nurse telling me congratulations- the first person to say it out loud to me! I almost burst into tears I was so happy I have zero negative to say here. It felt like a spa for my eggs. I always felt like a priority. From day 1, Stephanie at the front desk, knew and remembered my name, as if we'd known eachother forever. Gina is the sweetest and most helpful person. They made this process so easy and I felt so taken care of. I wish they could manage every part of my life. Multiple nurses treated me but it was a small staff so everyone knew me.  They were extremely responsive, especially via the portal.The nursing staff is fantastic (especially Julie!). We were originally assigned to a patient coordinator who wasn't the best fit for us (she talked a lot and said very little, if you know what I mean). But it was as if Dr. Talebian and the nursing team picked up on this and we quickly moved to working with just the nursing team. Very responsive and compassionate. They were great at relaying information in a timely manner.  Email communication was frequent. I would often see the same nurses for my blood draw and consultations and they always remembered my situation as well. I got clear medication instructions and my calls were promptly returned. LOVE the nursing staff. My only extremlly petty complaint is that many of them were pregnant and I felt that was sort of a slap in the face to many of the women who were having such a hard time. And the nurses at CCRM...where do I begin?!  They make you feel warm and welcome, even though you are scared and nervous.  They ALL remember your name and are extremely efficient with bloodwork.  Even the receptionist is welcoming.  Do not waste your time at other clinics, go straight to CCRM.Excellent. They seem very well informed of my history and the calls always feel very personal.They are very research focused, willing to try the best approach for each patient. They’re also incredibly organized and everyone there is compassionate. I’ve never felt like a number with anyone, from the front desk to the doctors. I can’t recommend CCRM highly enough.I went to CCRM NY because they were the closest to my office.  Only later did I find out they are one of the top clinics and use the most advanced science.  The more I learned about IVF, the more confident I felt like I was in great hands with CCRM NY.   This clinic is cutting edge in their approaches, clearly keeps up with current research practices and doesn’t just recommend the same old stuff that everywhere else does, and pivots when they need to The staff is competent and  everyone is a sweetheart. I dont have a single negative thing to say about them.Very clean, centrally located, easy to get to from the subway. The Office itself is comfortable and the waiting room is not overcrowded. Overall, it was a very easy check in and check out process. They were very accommodating even though I was late to my appointment! I felt comfortable inside. As modern as you can expect a new state of the art clinic to be. They go the extra mile with the little details such as heated blankets (which was a nice bonus) and at schedule appointments at accommodating times woth a lot of flexibility to the patient. I did once get there late they were very understanding. A top notch experience. Every single nurse knew my name and knew where I was along the way. When Dr. Knopman couldn't get back to me immediately they did.The nurses answered all my questions and were very compassionate. They are lovely and on point.Strengths: Best doctors in the industry. Beautiful, relaxing office. Messages always relayed to the doctors. Support staff, nurses, embryologists are all great. The nursing staff are friendly and patient.this clinic is excellent.  the only negative comment here is around cost.  they don't take any insurance-- at least that i know.  therefore all is out of pocket and it is premium prices.  Again, they are incredible and i will highly recommend them but budget is something we all have in mind as most likely you will need more than 1 round of anything.If you are looking for hand holding and personalized attention, CCRM is your clinic. It is a boutique concierge fertility center where it doesnt feel like you are just a number and getting a generic treatment and protocolconcierge feel.  you feel like part of the family.  organized and thorough.  timely responses from billing department.  very personal feel

I don't like that the monitoring hours are by appointment onlyCCRM tries hard to make the entire experience as comfortable and painless as possible. The practice feels more like a spa than a doctor's office and they run on time. Everyone is friendly and helpful.the nursing staff is great. they communicate efficiently via the portal and answered as many annoying questions as i threw their way. Same day lab results made the experience much more manageable. I looked forward to hearing from the nurse by noon and although I was on top of my care I knew I could count on them. Front desk staff were warm and welcoming, always greeted me by name and made the experience very personalized. Great nursing staff that was always accessible and providing the information and caring needed. Remembered my name and treated me like a real person. Always very positive. Couldn't speak higher of their attitudes. They are great at scheduling, communicating promptly, and have one of the best labs.
But they are very expensive. And you may not get all the educational resources you need upfront without taking it on yourself or asking.Friendly. Relaxing. Never waited long. I am from out of town - was always treated with respect and compassion. Never felt like a number. Like that everything is st one place. I have nothing else to sayIncredible. Incredibly incredible. Did I mention incredible? Coming from NYU and what I lovingly referred to as the ""cattle call"" - CCRM is like a breath of fresh air.  From the minute you walk in the office staff recognize you and do their best to make sure you are well taken care of.  Even by phone the office team know who you are and are beyond helpful.Beautiful office with great facilities. The operating room is amazing - not having to go to a hospital for treatment. The only problem is seeing people you know in the waiting room.                                             Monitoring was always efficient. I never waited more than 20 minutes, and usually only 10-15. All staff excellent - knowledgeable and kind CCRM's strengths are its Doctors, Embryologists, and technologies.  The money goes primarily to these areas.  The business office & team could be organized a little better (8 of 10).  There was just a couple discrepancies/ minor confusion in the beginning between the consult and testing workups and before the IVF cycle started that left us wondering sometimes.  Each thing got worked out, but it took a couple emails/phone calls.  Once we were fully in the IVF cycle, the injection protocol, monitoring, egg retrieval, and follow up all went smoothly.  This is when we really became a ""fan"" of CCRM.The clinic's strengths are many. The front receptionists and administrators are fantastic. They always pick up the phone, rarely put you on hold and get back to you with the information you require. They are fast to book your appointments and share details on schedules. Very accommodating. As I mentioned, the nursing staff for bloods and ultrasound are fantastic. The facility is clean and modern. Instruments and rooms are clean and up to date. Sanitization is on point. Communicating through their encrypted portal via email is great for lab results, emails, questions, general billing questions. 

I would say be proactive about your health. Since at the end of the day, you've spent time, finances and emotion on this journey. Own it and communicate with the clinic often. Things can get missed due to patient volume and the time to catch up on a patient's background. The longest response times were from billing, consent forms and insurance pre-certification departments. They eventually assisted, but it was difficult to connect with them. The IVF nurses were great, but I definitely needed to stay on top of things. If something was amiss or instructions were conflicting, it would initially drive me crazy! Now, I'm much more in control and don't rely on them to reach out first. I would recommend the patient call or email them proactively. The clinic is great, large for NYC, clean, comfortable. Strength- the team of Doctors at CCRM. They are all great and rooting for you. The nurses are kind and really nice people. Everyone is a great communicator. Excellent service, you are never waiting long in waiting room, the online portal is easy to use. CCRM is very patient-friendly.  They move through appointments efficiently and allow you to make appointments even for your daily/weekly blood draws during your cycle.  The front desk is very warm and helpful, they are able to get you what you need quickly.  This is a great clinic. Doctors are top notch and nursing staff very professional. The office is never crowded and the wait time is minimal, which is really nice. The only word of caution is with the claim processing - they are working on improving their processes in assisting patients with insurance claims. CCRM is overall a fantastic experience. The office is clean and inviting and you are treated like an individual. During egg retrieval you are given your own private space and every detail is thought of: heated blankets, coconut water for after surgery, ""think"" underwear etc. During a transfer you have the option for a valium and acupuncture in the room where your transfer is. It is a clinic that prioritizes keeping the patient comfortable during an extremely uncomfortable time. They are also organized and professional, I never had a screw-up with medication doses or orders or instructions. They called me when they said they would and always followed-up more than I was even expecting. I honestly can't think of any weaknesses. I really appreciated the wide network that CCRM has which offers easy options should I ever move in the future. Additionally, they have pooled research and resources which made me feel the safest about freezing with them and knowing they have comprehensive emergency plans. The clinic's strengths are the insight, knowledge and compassion of everyone you deal with. The doctors and nurses really make you feel as if you are in the best hands. I'd say the weaknesses lie within the business office. They've made multiple errors on my insurance claim forms which is delaying the little reimbursement we receive.CCRM was very good in that they really take care of you every step of the way. You didn't feel like you were going to fall through the cracks, and it's very easy to lose your way in IVF, there are so many small details you have to go through. The only draw back is that it is very expensive. CCRM is the gold standard in medical care. I've been told many times that they are the most expensive - but the saying really is true....you get what you pay for.

The doctors are all top notch, every appointment I had ran on time and the facility is very nice. 

I also GREATLY appreciated that morning monitoring was on an appointment basis. I started a new job with an incredibly busy schedule during my stimulation process so would not have been able to do so had I needed to wait hours each morning for bloodwork/ultrasound. 
 I believe this clinic is amazing and very different from many in NY that are more like factories. I have had friends who had insanely long wait times, never saw their actual doctor, had information prescribed wrong etc. and that is not the case here. We saw our doctor at almost every visit and if not, we saw one of the other three doctors who are all amazing. We felt like we were in good hands with each of them and every visit was timely. The waiting room is peaceful and clean.CCRM is extremely organized, efficient, & made me feel like a patient rather than just a number like my previous clinic made me feel. One visit was a long wait due to an error but they were fast to rectify the problem.The location is fantastic and just next to the “Hope” sign in midtown. The waiting room is much more inviting than some other offices: view of time square, natural light, snacks and beverages. There isn’t much of a secondary waiting room, just 3 chairs to use if you have to wait between BW and US. Typically there isn’t a wait or it’s just a minute or so. The exam rooms can be a little cold in the winter. It’s great to only come to 1 office for everything meetings, monitoring, and procedures. Morning monitoring are scheduled appointments and are usually called within 5-10 mins of appointment time. If you want to see your doctor for monitoring you have to tell them when making the appointment. If not, you just see the doctor covering AM monitoring. 
If you know you are going for blood and ultrasound and a nurse tells you differently question it. They could have inaccurate information. Although the clinic is on the smaller side, confusion can still happen! CCRM is well run and efficient. The different departments (front desk, nursing, doctors, billing) seem to be well coordinated and communicate well. You make an appointment for monitoring so there is generally little waiting around beforehand though on occasion the wait time for the ultrasound portion would be long. The clinic was really pleasant and really prompt and timely for the most part which I really respect. It’s really nice when you actually get seem at your appointment time! They made the whole experience as comfortable and easy as possible.Strengths are everyone on the staff, they are all trying to work with you and not just find a way to ""trick you"" with services you may not need (which happened at other NYC clinic)
The biggest weakness would be that they don't accept many major insurances which in this field could lead many patients away. CCRM NY is conveniently located in midtown, has excellent hours to accommodate work schedules, is a beautiful environment with state of the art equipment. The waiting area and patient rooms are bright and sunny. The operating area is beautiful. It is by far the nicest doctors office I have ever been to.  I give it an A+The office is located within walking distance from my place, which was amazing given the number of visits throughout our time at CCRM. The office is large, welcoming, inundated by a lot of light. The surgery unit (where egg retrieval takes place) is located on the main floor, very convenient. Rooms are easy to navigate. I can't remember any weaknesses I  just remember they were on time, efficient and friendly... They were very flexible in terms of fitting me in if I was running late or needed to reschedule which was most of the time!The team at CCRM NY is amazing.  Every single person working there is dedicated to their work and you can tell that it is important to them.  Also one of our favorite departments is Amanda, who is the insurance coordinator.  If you ever wanted someone to go to bat for you against the terrible insurance companies she is the one you want.  We called her our secret weapon, she was fierce!The clinic has a nice waiting area and might feel a step up from other clinics but the front desk staff are rude. There are too many people in different departments that it makes it very complicated to get answers to basic questions. There were several co-ordinators and different point people that we were never quite sure who we should contact for what. The billing department was sloppy and charged incorrectly several times which became frustrating and complicated to sort out. CCRM is wonderful from top to bottom. From the minute you walk into the clinic, you will feel comfortable and know you are in the right place! Doctors, nurses, medical assitants, front desk,  billing department- they really ALL are fantastic! Being in healthcare myself, I took extra attention to how great they really are at their jobs and why CCRM is the best in the business. It's gotten busier but what I loved was that it was calm, there was always a water machine available, and things seemed to run smoothly. The clinic was very concerned about marketing and making money and this didn't bother me at first but did later. People will go the extra mile to explain things but with financials and some prescriptions, there were miscommunications re why I had to pay out of pocket and I spent a lot of extra time making spreadsheets for medications before learning that they were being prescribed for off label use. So communicating that to me via a nurse and not a finance person may have been better/easier.CCRM does not take insurance... and while that may be a huge drawback from some, if you can afford it I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND THEM.  They are an incredibly talented and compassionate team, and we felt like we were in very trustworthy hands. The receptionists are lovely. This probably sounds insignificant but when you call and see them as much as I have, it makes a difference. They know patients name after a few visits, rarely put you on hold, are great at scheduling (including sometimes by email). The waiting room environment, exam rooms and operating room are pristine. I honestly can't say a bad thing about CCRM. They are so organized and so on top of things. I was always able to get an appointment at the time that I wanted, and I always felt totally taken care of. CCRM is an incredible place for so many reasons. You are not treated like a number and the level of personal care and attention is unlike any office. 

It is a beautiful space, clean, high technology, super organized, easy to make appointments, speak to nurses, speak to people about insurance, ordering Meds and talking with doctors. 

They have all of the lab facilities on site and it is of the highest quality. The OR room is also on site and imaculaye. The nurses and embroyoligist pre, during and after the procedure are with you the whole time and so warm and comforting. They give you warm towels, snacks , play what music you want to listen to and completely do whatever they can to make you feel at ease.

All of the doctors collaborate and meet daily. They are not competing with one another and it makes you feel like you are part of a special community.The clinic is beautiful, clean, and spa-like. The waiting room has never been packed, but I have seen many couples waiting in the blood draw area. The receptionists are great. The website and patient portal could use some serious design and UX help.strenghts - scheduled moniotring times - though go early as you still can wait. direct communcation. billing person. all responsive.

weaknesses - none to date except having to wait sometimes and been taken in late for a set appt time.CCRM is incredible. They're communicative, easy to reach, and organized. Their waiting area is a little like a sanctuary with the seltzer machine and granola bars. The front desk staff is AMAZING. Going through IVF meds has been one of the most stressful experiences I've gone through, and while I didn't love going to the doctor's office everyday for blood work and ultrasound, I honestly couldn't ask for a better place to go. CCRM is the Ritz of Fertility Clinics. You are a person and not a patient. The wait in the morning for monitoring is negligible compared to other clinics but more importantly, they are warm, professional, approachable and accommodating. They realize what a sensitive process IVF is and how all-consuming it can be. I felt that they really understood that and tried to make everything as easy as possible for me. I didn't have to jump through a million hoops to try and get in touch with my doctor or nurse; I could email them directly, which, as a patient, meant the world to me. I felt like I was being heard and helped rather than dismissed and appeased (as I felt at the prior clinic I was at). From my first visit, I felt very comfortable at CCRM. Pro: they make everything as easy as possible from the superficial (soothing decor and waiting room snacks) to the substantial (HOURS spent on the phone with my insurance to help me understand coverage of IVF - big shout out to Amanda!). They are super flexible on timing and only once have I ever experienced a longer wait time. 

Con: It is expensive. Like, really expensive. I am very fortunate to be able to come here but most people cannot afford this level of care. Hopefully in my case it will be worth it but at least CCRM has assured me total peace of mind throughout this entire process. The CCRM staff is exceptional; everyone (including all of the doctors) knew my name and my case.  Every doctor there is warm and incredibly smart – I felt lucky knowing these people were caring for me.  CCRM does not feel like a medical clinic.  The waiting room has couches and music; the exam rooms (especially the embryo transfer room) doesn’t feel sterile.  I initially didn’t think making a monitoring appointment would be important.  But having waited for over an hour at other clinics for my monitoring, I now appreciate how nice it is that I never waited at CCRM.  They have lots of appointments and could always fit me in.   I also appreciate that they don’t over monitor you so you could try to live a normal life during this process. The only weakness is that CCRM is expensive compared to other clinics.  But for me, they were also the most successful. The clinic was state of the art, clean, friendly, and great location. 
Waiting room has snacks and coffee, drinks.
There was never a wait longer than 15 minutes for any of my appointments.
The staff is accomodating in your scheduleI do feel like communication is excellent, particularly with access to your actual doctor. This helped allievate so much anxiety throughout the process. I also felt like I was treated as a human and individual. Definitely follow-up with any questions and advocate for yourself.The clinic is state of the art and impeccably clean.  The staff is so efficient at scheduling appointments and keeping them timely.  The patient portal is very user-friendly.  Everything is done onsite-- blood work results come back very quickly.  They have an onsite embryology lab.  The egg retrieval and embryo transfer are both done onsite in state of the art facilities.The office is gorgeous. Dr. Levine did an amazing job designing the clinic. Everything is state of the art. Their ultrasounds especially are so advanced and give amazing picture quality. They have a great set-up with a large screen that is visible to the patient in addition to the regular screen that he was looking at. My husband also really enjoyed the coffee and snacks in the waiting room :) The staff was very well coordinated and very efficient. Each visit I had an ultrasound and blood draws and they always happened consecutively. There was no going back to the waiting room to wait in between.This clinic offers highly personalized and sophisticated fertility treatments. The space is relaxing (more like a spa than a clinic), clean, and conveniently located in Manhattan.

When we were first choosing a clinic (after a disastrous 3 months at Columbia's practice), I called CCRM NY with some questions.  Instead of directing me to their website or SART data, they actually were able to put me on the phone with the head of the embryo lab! She spent about a half hour on the phone with me answering all kinds of questions about IVF in general, and their specific practices. It was an impressive level of access, but that is just par for the course with CCRM NY.  If you are a patient (or even a possible patient), they treat you with incredible attention, respect and consideration. It's basically the difference between a 3 Michelin star meal and McDonalds. I would recommend them to anyone considering fertility treatment. Very clean, coffee and water in the waiting room. Nice relaxing music. Plenty of space so you're not sitting on top of each other. Billing took a bit longer than I would have hoped. I had to wait a few weeks to submit to insurance for payment b/c the billing office was behind. But they did take care of submitting everything to insurance which was really nice. Felt like white glove service. The clinic is brand new.  Facilities are impeccable.  Patients are on a first name basis with the staff and are treated very well.After being at Neway and Cornell, CCRM is, in my opinion, the most progressive clinic in NYC. Their protocols are based off of thorough client history and up to date industry research. Their facilities are warm, open, organized and clean. I truly believe their standard of care is by far superior to all other clinics. The only downfall is they don't accept insurance, but patients do get reimbursed out of network. The good news is, I think the chances of getting pregnant are higher than other clinics that do (this is based on my experience, not on research). The clinic itself is absolutely gorgeous.  It overlooks times square, its spotless and just state of the art.  I was one of their first patients in June 2016 when they had just opened.  I felt a few of the nuances going on but it never impacted my treatment.  Most recently I found out about services from outside insurance for services/treatment that I had not known I was covered for.  The billing dept is being very diligent is seeing for some retroactive funds which I am very appreciate of.  I would highly recommend CCRM to anyone TTC. CCRM NY was overall an amazing experience.  I did not feel like just a number and the clinic never felt overly crowded, although I think they were super busy at the time.  The space is gorgeous and so clean and minimal.  It didn't even feel like a doctor's office.  I felt like I got top-notch care.  I got in quickly for my monitoring appointments because they schedule their patients for monitoring and space them out so no one waits very long.  All the nursing staff were warm and skilled.  It is a CLEAN, relaxing, warm environment. There is always a smile at the door when you enter and when you leave.  They only have the best on staff from the nurses, to the billing, to the embryologist, to the Doctors of course. The standards at CCRM are high and that made me comfortable.CCRM was wonderful, I truly cannot express my gratitude. I would highly recommend CCRM. The office was clean and organized. The office knows you by name and gives you undivided attention. They have a great team in place to get you the best results. For monitoring, they give you a time slot so it works well and you don’t wait too long.  The billing department is useful and gets back to your questions in a reasonable amount of time.  Communicating with the nurses through the patient portal didn’t always lead to getting your questions answered quickly.  Communicating with the doctor in the beginning when we first met with Dr. Levine was easy.  It seemed as Dr. Levine got busier it become tougher to schedule times to talk.Very clean clinic, waiting room makes you feel at home. Also extremely accommodating with early morning time slots, I was coming in every few days for blood work and could not take time off work for all of these appointments (and didn’t want to tell work either) and I was able to get 8am or 830am appointments every single time! I was never late for work once This clinic is cutting edge, and everything happens on site: retrievals, scans, etc. It's never crowded, there's no cattle call monitoring. This place is luxurious compared to a lot of the other big clinics in NY. Their billing is also very straightforward and stress free, which is all you can hope for when spending boatloads of money!I'll say that the clinic itself is only as good as the people and doctors that work there.  To that end, all my comments to now about Dr. Levine, his team and his nursing team truly speak for the value and experience of CCRM NY.  
With that said, the clinic has amazing facilities.  They are located well, easy to get to (particularly when you have to go there frequently), have world class facilities and a very good embryology team that is very responsive when you are trying to get a daily status on the embryos development.   
Another SUPER important member of the team were Stephanie and Gina, the front desk team that booked our appointments and checked us in.  They were superb, and always very accommodating of our schedule.  They were often the folks we interacted with the most and we really loved our experience with them.  I would be remiss if i didn't acknowledge their contribution and support on our journey.

CCRM NY just opened in New York a few years ago and so i can imagine that as time goes and they grow more, they will likely need more space and facilities. CCRM feels like walking into a spa. It is quiet, has orchids, lots of seating, not crowded. The staff is so welcoming, they remembered my name after one visit. They were so encouraging and brightened my day! They seemed truly happy for me when I got pregnant! The snacks beverages are a great touch. The ""comfy room"" where I had my IUIs had real bed sheets and pillow, and was much appreciated. I immediately became calmer once I switched to CCRM, these details helped to calm the otherwise stressful experience of trying to conceive. Brand new facility, ultra clean and comfortable.  Compared to Yale, which was a total dump, this facility was cutting edge.  The actual surgical room is in the facility, and was clean and comfortable with great amenities.  The equipment was also top notch. I can't say enough about this team. Regardless of the outcome of this cycle, they have always been well organized, highly communicative and so incredibly kind. To be known by name when I walk in the door means so much during such a stressful time!It’s a relaxing place, highly communicative, and tech savvy. Support staff make a difficult experience enjoyable. Everyone from front desk to medical assistants to doctors are friendly. I feel like I would not be able to go through this process if I weren’t at CCRM.Wonderful personalized care in a beautiful setting. I had been to other clinics where for monitoring you show up and have to wait in line--here you are given an appointment. I also loved that they allowed husbands to be present for embryo transfer. Their strength is their knowledge. I knew from the moment I walked into the office that I would be in great hands and they made every step easy to deal with & communicated everything & constantly answered all my questions and concerns.Great, clean facility that is super helpful and organized.   They do not take insurance which is the only reason we switched clinics.  It was becoming to much of a financial burden. I think they also have a more aggressive treatment approach for lesbian couples than in retrospect I would have elected for (or medicated cycles before natural) however given my age (35) I understand this is reasonable approach.  They also would have been amenable to changing protocols if I insisted.  Also loved the sparkling water machine and the office ambience.  I know that sounds silly but it was more like a spa then a clinic which helps during stressful procedures.  This is the best clinic in New York.  We ve been to three of the other “top” clinics an CCRM has the best staff by far.  They actually care about their patients.  You also get to talk to someone right away with any questions instead of having to wait for a response. You also get the doctors email address and he responds back right away. Dr Levine also sends follow up emails, during pregnancy, and even after out daughter was born. I can't speak highly enough of CCRM.  The doctors are knowledgeable and caring, the nurses are professional, the embryologists are available to speak with, and the office feels like a spa.  Their approach is state of the art, and I have felt it - my recovery from procedures at CCRM have been short and painless compared to the ones at the previous clinic I attended.  Very through, but expensive. hardly any waiting times for monitoring or procedures. Basically, you are paying for high quality care. They don't take insurance, but will bill your insurance for you if there's out of network coverage. Billing people will even call insurance companies for you. Clinic is clean, professional, beautiful quiet setting. They generally run on time. I found the stff extremlly helpful in managing appointments and orders from outside labs. I am curious to know what their current success rates are as compared to the national averages. But overall I do recommend this clinic. Strengths:  Ease of making appointments, low wait time, friendly staff. The compassion of the entire staff is evident from the moment you c all to make an appointment. They are friendly and nothing is rushed. Everyone greets you by your first name as there is no feeling as if you're just a number. CCRM is extremely organized and efficient. The office is clean, beautiful and run very efficiently. I really appreciated that they were open 7 days a week for monitoring. The nurses during the egg retrieval were especially outstanding but they were also wonderful during the many blood tests and monitoring appointments. I absolutely love working with CCRM.The clinic is absolutely spotless and has state of the art equipment.  It is centrally located and feels more like a wellness center than a clinic. Wait times are super short and sweetened with free coffee and fizzy water.Compared to others, it’s a nice experience. This is important when you’re there almost every day for weeks. The atmosphere is lovely, the staff is friendly, and you’re made to feel good when you’re there.This clinic was AMAZING!! It was so clean, bright and cheery. They play relaxing music, have coffee, tea, water and snacks. It makes you feel very relaxed.The individualized care received was great for a big clinic. I never felt like I could reach my doctor or the staff at any time. Quality of care in exceptional. Their internal billing is great but the external tests come with an inundation of paperwork. That is one thing that could be changed. Location is convenient. Office is beautiful.I give it 100%.  On time, clean, professional and friendly!The clinic’s office staff are friendly and personable, professional, competent and accommodating. It’s easy to make and confirm appointments, and they work with your schedule. I find the nurses to be patient and sweet as well. From the time I arrived at the office, I was seen pretty quickly.relatiavely small center, conviently located, very comfortable waiting area. Great clinic - would absolutely recommend. Clean, easy, doesn't feel like going to a standard New York doctor's office in a great way. Generally seen on time or within about 15 minutes of appointment time.Everyone is so professional. Nurses, front desk, billing, everyone...

Environment is calm, serene and pleasant. The front desk staff were friendly and all were extremely helpful. This NEVER happens in NYC! Wait time was minimal. 

I never once felt burdened to be there even though the process was cumbersome, uncomfortable and scary. Oddly, looking back, I enjoyed my frequent visits and saw it a refueling; almost like a respite. 

The billing staff was absolutely incredible. I can’t really imagine going elsewhere and we do plan to return. Outside of the cost I cannot thing of any negative factors. I honestly wouldn’t consider the cost a negative factor though, in life you get what you pay for!

The office is clean, modern, comfortable and accommodating. The staff is great and they are EXTREMELT prompt and stick to appointment times like clock work!A little bit more guidance and options for getting medication. The previous clinic I went to had a long list of pharmacies around the country that I could call around and they also had some insights on discounts I could getStrengths= availability cleanliness and professionalism 
No weaknesses - everyone is completely kind and comfortable to be around - this clinic is the best I know!!! Thank goodness that this clinic was known by my doctor !!! The only improvement here is that everyone should know about this clinic !! 

You don’t feel like you’re in a doctors office, feel very comfortable. The staff is very engaging and make an effort to know you as a person and not just as a patient. Office is beautiful and welcoming. No weaknesses!An efficient well run machine. No waiting, compassionate Doctors. I loved the team at CCRM so if Dr. Levine was not available it was always great to see the other Doctors- they are all good. Dr Knopman is so kind, Dr. Talebian encouraging, Dr Choi matter of fact but in a good way. Wait time was minimal and process very smooth. SEAMLESS, I was able to arrive for my scheduled time, sit in a beautiful lobby with snacks, drinks, magazines and was always seen for my appointment within 5 minutes of arriving (even if I was early). I primarily went to the Garden City office which was small. The waits were generally ~ 10 min, and I always saw the same staff, so it felt quite friendly. It was an extremely well oiled machine. The office was very busy but very efficient. ",9.7,9.5,"Every time I went into the clinic for blood work and ultrasounds, the nurses were always gentle, efficient and had the biggest smiles on their faces. They would reach out to me within minutes of me writing to them through the portal or calling them. The clinic is beautiful and monitoring is a breeze. You are greeted by name and they are always timely and willing to work with you on appointment times. Dr. Levine and the staff at CCRM NY are passionate about what they do. They were extremely responsive, especially via the portal. You make an appointment for monitoring so there is generally little waiting around beforehand though on occasion the wait time for the ultrasound portion would be long. People will go the extra mile to explain things but with financials and some prescriptions, there were miscommunications re why I had to pay out of pocket and I spent a lot of extra time making spreadsheets for medications before learning that they were being prescribed for off label use. It is a beautiful space, clean, high technology, super organized, easy to make appointments, speak to nurses, speak to people about insurance, ordering Meds and talking with doctors. Their billing is also very straightforward and stress free, which is all you can hope for when spending boatloads of money!I'll say that the clinic itself is only as good as the people and doctors that work there.

39,CCRM New York,protocol,"two rounds of timed intercourse with letrazole I completed my retrevial with Dr. Knopman. I started with an estrogen patch and the  I did a total of 12 days of meds - menopure, gonal-f, clomid, dex., then added ganerlex and the hcg and Lupron.  About half way through I increased my menopure from 150 to 225. We did one egg retrieval cycle that collected 10 eggs.  9 were mature.  8 fertilized.  6 reached the blastocyst stage by day 5.  We froze the embryos and did CCS testing.  3 of the frozen embryos were euploid.  We transferred one embryo and I got pregnant.Anti-histamine protocol, timed intercourse, luteal support.Injectables. Then Clomid as I responded better. I was diagnosed with a slightly lower egg supply (diminished ovarian reserve), with high FSH.  My AMH is considered normal/age appropriate... somewhat of a conundrum.  So designing a treatment protocol that would wake up enough eggs but not make me overstimulate was important.  
The protocal included...
Estrogen priming, Menopur, Follistim, later added in Ganirellix, and 2 trigger shots.  I didn't overstimulate and was pleased with the number of eggs retrieved. Our first two protocols were letrozole + Ovidrel trigger followed by specifically timed intercourse. With diminished ovarian reserve due to age, this rationale was to get the best egg response and time my cycle. We also added luteal support with progesterone inserts and estrogen patches. Unfortunately, we didn't conceive. Dr Levine then suggested trying an IUI which would increase our chances slightly, but get the sperm at least closer to the egg -- if that was the conception issue. We did the same medication protocol with letrozole (great response from my body), ovidrel trigger followed by a specifically timed IUI. We used a fresh sperm sample the day of the IUI with no male factor issues. Unfortunately, this didn't lead to conception either. Dr Levine has no adjusted course which my husband and I really appreciate. He didn't push us one way or the other actually -- he simply informed us of our options. We decided to skip another IUI and move into IVF due to my age, ovarian response and success rates with IVF. We started with a month of estrogen priming followed by a cycle of menopur + cetrotide + clomid + dexamethasone + gonal f + and will trigger with lupron + novarel when the time comes for retrieval. He changed clomid to lupron during my second cycle and I'm on estrogen pills with lupron, menopur, and gonal this cycle- our third. First cycle only had one egg- cancelled, second cycle 5 follicles, 2 eggs retrieved. We are hoping for better results third time around. Early on we tried two IUIs with letrozole and a trigger shot, which was a very comfortable first step for us in the early process.  Then we moved to our first egg retrieval and did one medicated transfer (using progesterone, patches, supplements, etc.) and one ""natural"" transfer (using just the patches and suppositories).  Our first transfer resulted in a negative pregnancy test and our second resulted in a chemical pregnancy.  We did a second retrieval and for our third transfer we did a ""natural"" transfer with two embryos and supported by supplemental IVIG treatments provided by Dr. Jonathan Scher, which was ultimately successful.  I have done two cycles so far with Dr. Talebian. Based on my history, we did the lupron protocol combined with Menopur and Gonal F. I responded well the first time, less the second time. We suspect that it’s because the first time I was prep’d with estrogen patches, and with the contraceptive pill the second time. 
For my third cycle we will start w the patches, the Gonal F and Menopur combined with Clomid. I will be triggered w lupron and HCG. After two failed rounds on IVF at another clinic (where many embryos were made but few made it to PGS testing and none were ""good"") she added micro dose lupron to my protocol and it worked. While I still only had one embryo sent to PGS testing it was one more than we had the last two rounds and it came back ""good"" and we are now 8 weeks pregnant. N/A, unable to recall full specifics. I experienced a very straightforward egg retrieval. I began with birth control. Went in for blood work and then began my Lupron shot that evening. The next day continued the Lupron shots in the am/pm and a Dexamethasone pill in the am. Then on day 3, I continued the Lupron and Dexamethasone pill and added menopur and Gonal F. My partner also started his antibiotic. I continued on this course of treatment, without alterations, until my retrieval surgery on 2 weeks and 1 day later.I did an estradiol patch post ovulation, then 2 weeks of dexathemsome tablets, menapur injectables, and Lupron.
In the evening I injected Gonal F and Lupron. 
Then we did the egg retrieval. 
The first round gave 2 blasts but neither were successfull. We will try one more round of egg retrieval. Standard Antagonist protocol. When I was slow to respond to Gonal-F and Menopur, she added Clomid which seemed to kick start things a bit.  We started with letrozole and then moved to an IUI before doing IVF.We first did an IUI unfortunately did not work on the first try. Since I have done previous IUI's at a different clinic my husband & I agreed to go through IVF. My eggs were retrieved & were frozen. Prior to the retrieval I was on Menopur, Gonal F, & Cetrocide. I was on two months of Lupron (induced menopause) pror to my egg transfer recommended by Dr. Levine since I had severe endometriosis. After egg transfer I had progesterone oil shots, estrogen patches, &progesterone suppositories. After this cycle I am happy to say I am currently eight weeks pregnant.After reviewing our disappointment in the 3 rounds done at a previous clinic, Dr Knopman immediately started asking questions and coming up with new ideas. Number 1: mirror my first cycle by starting a 2 week round of birth control Number 2: noting the PCOS, begin taking Metformin, Shot protocol: 175 Follistim, add menopur and ganerelix after 6 days.  Trigger was both HCG and Lupron but split into am and pm doses. We got 19 eggs, only 1 made it to blast on day 6 and was genetically tested. Test came back normal! estrogren priming (about 1 week) 
oral steriod
Clomid 10 days
Menupor 150
Gonal 300
Centrotide
HCG 10,000 iu trigger
First retrieval: traditional cycle with menopur and gonal, and cetrotide added halfway through. Lupron trigger at the end. This yielded 4 eggs and one pgs normal blastocyst. 
Second retrieval: Lupron protocol to try to increase egg count. This resulted in greatest drop off between number of eggs (5) and number mature/fertilized (2). No blastocysts.
Third retrieval: back to the original menopur, gonal and cetrotide protocol though the amounts of menopur and gonal were slightly different. This yielded 6 eggs (5 mature), 4 fertilized but no blastocysts.  Dr. Choi came up with my hormone treatment based on my blood work and initial ultrasound and adjust as she felt she needed to as I continued to go for blood work and ultrasounds throughout the process. I never questioned the decisions she was making along the way.Although odds were slim for me to have a successful IVF round using my own eggs she was willing to try two different attempts. Along the way we had multiple touch points and conversations regarding possible donor eggs - never a push - just a gentle suggestion for whenever we were ready to go down that path. 3 IUI - all medicated - none worked 
Egg retrieval with medication and PICSI (14 eggs retrieved, 4 made it to day 5 embryos, 2 genetically screened ok - one of which is our daughter and one frozen embryo). After my first egg retrieval, we realized that I had a major issue with egg quality and maturity. Going into my next retrieval, Dr. Knopman had me change my diet, take a ton of supplements, and introduced Microdose Lupron into my protocol. It drastically changed my results. Unfortunately, I'm still having issues having embryos make it to blast in large numbers, but we certainly improved my egg maturity. Because it was our first time seeing a RE, he started with a very thorough diagnosis procedure and recommended that we attempt IUI first, explaining to us the success rate of this procedure compared to the slightly more invasive IVF procedure. After a few IUI attempts that were not working for us, he recommended that we move on to IVF, which we did, ultimately achieving success on our first embryo transfer. During my first visit, we discussed retrieval and donor she explained each protocol and allowed me and my husband to weigh out our options...I never felt rushed or pushed in either direction. The information she provided us helped make our decision and most importantly we never felt judged. The Doc communicated with our previous Fertility Dr. so that she did not duplicate what did not work already.  She then discussed it with other Dr's at CCRM to come up with the best course of action for us.  Between the 2 of us we went thru 4 IVF cycles and I went thru many IUI's.  I could tell you every drug protocol we used, but the truth is that we tried them all until one worked.We did one natural cycle IUI then introduced Letrozole low dose for the 2nd IUI cycle which didn't produce any extra eggs. Then the doctor increased the dose for the last cycle and I got 2 mature eggs. Egg Retrieval: Menopur + Gonal F X10 days. He then triggered me with Lupron and HCG as I has a risk for OHHS. Retrieval prep was quite easy! Went to work 2 days later!
STIM FET: Menopur injectables to thicken uterine lining (Fluid issues and thin lining during previous cycle at previous clinic.  Dr. Levine thought my body responded better to endogenous estrogen production. Only needed one prep, one transfer, and were pregnant with our baby!   I don't remember a lot about the retrieval except it was more medication than I had ever used in other retrievals and that it involved lots of estrogen patches that were very expensive; I did have lupron for weeks and ovulated through that (I think it was meant to suppress ovulation) -- and I was upset about that but we stayed almost on course. It was upsetting when numbers weren't going right and I wasn't comfortable ultimately with doing the transfer then if I'd ovulated but I really trusted her and was super optimistic at the time.I was patched for both rounds at CCRM to control my estrogen levels. My first round I was given Clomid to help boost stim cycle but it did not work for me - i ended up getting more cysts than eggs and we only retrieved 2 eggs, we got 1 day 5 embryo which we screened and came back normal

Round 2 we used Lupron, Menopur and Follistim and ended up yielding 10 eggs, and 4 made it to day 5, we sent all 4 to get tested and we got 2 normal embryos back 

we froze all 3 of our embryos. 
In July we did a Frozen transfer(1 embryo) , and for 2 months prior to that I was on a slow release Lupron. Our transfer was successful and I am currently 12 weeks pregnant!!!I first went to Dr Levine after another clinic was pushing me to do IVF without much explanation or consideration. Dr Levine had us do 3 cycles of letrozole with timed intercourse. He also prescribed an HSG, which found 2 polyps. While removing them via a hysteroscopy, he also found and a small septum. After that surgery we did 1 IUI, which was successful but ended in an early miscarriage. He is now recommending IVF due to expected poor egg quality. We are starting next month after waiting 1 full cycle after the miscarriage At my first appointment, Dr. Levine diagnosed me with unexplained fertility and recommended that we proceed with a course of Letrazole followed by an Ovidrel trigger shot and timed intercourse. He wanted to start off as non-invasive as possible and then ramp up as needed. After three unsuccessful cycles of timed intercourse, Dr. Levine suggested trying an IUI, and I was ready to move to the next step. Fortunately, my first IUI was successful -- and I am now 5 months pregnant with a baby girl! I used menopur and follism protoc for the first two cycles and the Lupron protocol for the third cycle. I was most successful with the Lupron protocol. Dr. Knopman had been seeing positive results with the Lupron and since my AMH was low she thought after trying two cycles without it this could yield better results and it did.I'm just starting my first IVF cycle. Dr. Talebian has me on an estrogen patch for about a week before my first suppression ultrasound and blood work. Then, I'll start on 300 units of Gonal-F and 2 vials of Menopur along with an oral steroid. My husband will start a round of antibiotics when I begin my injections. Depending on how the stimulation goes, I'll start the Centrotide and eventually do an HCG trigger shot and Lupron.
They told me that after the embryo transfer (hopefully we will get some!), I'll be doing progesterone shots. She also said that a daily baby aspirin would be something advisable after an embryo transfer.
As far as the fertilization, she told us we could do a mix of ICSI and PICSI. This helps give potentially damaged sperm the best shot at making a good embryo.For my april retrieval i will be doing:

Estrogen priming
likely 250 combined menopur and gonal f
cetrotide - tbd when
lupron somewhere along the way - need to find out more
I'm still in the midst of my first IVF cycle. So far, we've tried 1 IUI cycle which was unsuccessful, and Dr. Knopman recommended we go straight to IUI. After my egg retrieval resulted in 23 eggs but only 1 viable embryo, I'm so grateful we followed her advice of not continuing IUI cycles when the likelihood was very minimal. Right now I'm about to start a depo-lupron cycle to deal with endometriosis and prepare for a transfer of the embryo. I started off wearing estrogen patches, then added on Lupron, Menopure, and Gonal. I cannot remember specific dosing but I know that my dosing varied with my numbers, which indicated individualization of treatment. Letrozole and Ovidrel injection; second cycle = Letrozole and Ovidrel injection before IUI, Progesterone suppositories and Estrogen patch post-IUI; third cycle = Clomid and Ovidrel injection before IUI, Progesterone suppositories and Estrogen patch post-IUI (resulted in chemical pregnancy); fourth cycle = same as third - Clomid and Ovidrel injection before IUI, Progesterone suppositories and Estrogen patch post-IUI.Egg retrieval: Started w/ 5 days of letrozole then added menopur and gonal and an oral steroid.  Cetrotide added towards the= end.  Triggered with HCG and lupron.
Embryo transfer: estrogen patch, progesterone suppositories, progesterone injections every 2 days.  While I initial objected to the injection, he showed me studies indicating the progesterone injection produced more live births.I went in for a consult last year to determine my perfect timing on egg retrieval and see where I stood as far as follicles, etc. Dr. Choi then took her time to explain every detail, performed an ultrasound and we determined I had more follicles than expected and could wait on this procedure until I was ready. She never pressured me to get it done right away. I went back this year to start the process. Ultrasounds, meds instructions, and the day of the retrieval were all very easy due to her care and precision in what she does. She truly is a master of her work.I did not have low ovarian reserve so Dr. Talebian purposely did not overstimulate me during retrieval. I had 14 eggs retrieved, 13 mature, 12 fertilized, and 9 went out for PGS testing. 6 came back normal. During first FET, which was a natural transfer based on my ovulation due to negative effects from birth control, we transferred a 5 day 5AA embryo. This resulted in a pregnancy. We saw a heartbeat at 6 and 7 weeks, but during the 8 week ultrasound there was no heartbeat. I also had a SCH during the pregnancy, but ultimately the cause of m/c was undetermined. Repeat loss panel was performed. Only thing that came up was that I was homozygous for MTHFR. I changed my diet and used Lovenox with next natural FET. A 7-day 6BB was transferred. I stayed on Lovenox through 36 weeks. This pregnancy resulted in my daughter.I don't really remember.  The egg retrieval was pretty standard protocol if I recall.  And for the embryo transfer, the first cycle was on lupron and it just wasn't working for me-- my lining would not thicken, so he readjusted and put me on a menopur protocol, which worked like a charm.  I am so thankful he took the time to reassess and thought outside the box!I knew from a prior physician that I had diminished ovarian reserve (DOR). Brian correctly identified that I also had a luteal phase defect in that after I ovulated, the second half of my cycle was very short - on average only 8-10 days. This wasn't long enough for an embryo to implant even if my egg was getting fertilized. I had been treated with Clomid (despite a thin lining) and estrogen pills by my previous fertility specialist. He switched me to Letrozole (doesn't thin your lining), estrogen patches (works better than the pills), and progesterone suppositories which helped to lengthen my luteal phase. I truly think that was the key and if we had done that sooner we wouldn't have had so many failed cycles before finding the right combination of meds that finally helped us to get pregnant.The first cycle I believe was fairly standard - menopur and follistim. I had 10 eggs retrieved, 7 were mature, 6 successfully fertilized, 2 made it to blastocyst for testing, but 0 were healthy.

Dr. Levine had me take 2 months off between cycles so that I could take some steps to improve my chances. I did acupuncture 2x a week, took a large CoQ-10 supplement daily, cooked nearly all of my meals myself with an eye towards minimizing insulin responses and eating unprocessed foods, reduced my work schedule and generally reduced my stress level.

For the second cycle, he did the Lupron antagonist protocol.  I only had 6 eggs retrieved, but all 6 fertilized.  All 6 made it to blastocyst.  3 were healthy.  We have transferred 1 of those 3 (which is now a 7-week pregnancy), and have the other 2 cryogenically frozen for future children.We did Clomid for 2 months but my body didn't react as he wanted, so we switched to Letrozole bc Dr Levine thought my eggs would react better to this. He was right. On our first IUI on Letrozole, we got a positive!My partner had been on birth control for 10 years prior to meeting Dr. Levine as a way to suppress the chance of ovarian cancer because she is BRCA1 positive.  She also had not had a period for that time.  She first went through an egg retrieval at another institution and only yielded approximately 5 ""mature"" eggs. Dr. Levine recognized that, she had a condition, which is escaping me, that could be remedied by adding additional hormonal medicines.  It is important to note that had she gone back to the first fertility institution they would have put her on the same protocol as the first time.  With Dr. Levine, she was able to yield 29 eggs!Birth Control 2 weeks then microdose lupron only for few days then microdose lupron + menopure + follistim. HcG a day or so before trigger. 

Resulted in 4 eggs retrieved. Previous doctor's only got 2 tops. All 4 fertilized but didn't make it to day 7 for PGS biopsy. I dont recallI primed with estrogen patch in my luteal phase then did the injections twice a day until trigger and retrieval.  I triggered with HCG and lupron to protect me from OHSS, for which I was at risk because of high estrogen.  I retrieved 17 eggs and 14 were mature and froze.  My recovery was easy with no pain and just some bloating.  Same as all my other cycles started with estrogen patch (however, I believe my dose was higher or longer with this cycle) then we used menopur and follistim. Different than my other cycles, he treated me like I had endometriosis even though I was not diagnosed with it based on what he saw at my retrieval. So I was also taking Lupron leading up to the cycle start as well as during the cycle. Also I was on progesterone shots as well as endometrin. In the past I was only on endometrin. Dr. Levine used a standard protocol for our case. We tried two IUIs which were unsuccessful before moving on to IVF. Egg retrial went smooth, and first transfer lead to a positive pregnancy. Hardest decision is having to say yes to moving on to IVF but glad we did it as soon as Dr. Levine recommended it. He used a lupron flare where I used lupron prior to stimulation and during stimulation.  I was put on 225 menopur and 225 of Goyal f and triggered with HCG.  They retrieved 9 embryos, 7 of which were fertilized by ICSI.We were lucky enough to get pregnant naturally after the HSG test. We went through all initial work- sonograms to check uterus, blood work to track ovulation, HSG test, etc. Dr Levine even called us on a weekend over the summer to tell us I was ovulating, and sure enough we got pregnant that weekend I had 2 retrievals and one failed transfer (the only embryo didn't thaw!) at a different clinic. Dr Choi used a slightly different protocol than my previous retrievals in order to mature the eggs at a more consistent rate and it did seem to provide better results. We had 3 of 13 fertilize with ICSI and one ended up making it to freeze. Which is better than the results I had two previous times, one of which 11 were retrieved and NONE fertilized with ICSI. My case is very difficult, and the fact that she was able to get better results the first try says a lot. CCRM is also a bit more cutting edge with their supplement program which I do believe fosters better results.We started with an IUI with Clomid treatment that did not result in a positive pregnancy.   We were aware the chances are low.
On the first IVF cycle we used a standard protocol of Follistom, Menopur and Lupron shots every day, followed by an HCG trigger and retrieval.
On the second cycle Dr. Levine used a protocol of Follistom, Menopur, Cetrotide and Lupron towards the end, that resulted in many more eggs and higher quality as we had fertilization.  Calcium and ICSi were used to help with Fertilization.  Following the genetic testing, he put my wife on birth control pill for 5 weeks, with lupron shots the last 2 weeks in the evening.   Leading up to the transfer and thereafter he used a combination of progresterone shots, supposetries and estrogen patches.  &lt;happy to provide more detail if you need it&gt; Dr. Levine wanted me to try lezatrol after not getting pregnant on 4 cycles of clomid. He felt my body was capable of getting pregnant without IVF so wanted to try a different drug. He monitored the eggs and was very patient waiting for them to be exactly at the right stage before triggering me to ovulate. I felt rushed at Weil Cornell, like they wanted to just trigger me and didn't care if my follicles were really ready. We first tried a protocol with clomid, ganirelex and follistim, as well as doxycycline and prednisone, and a lupron plus HCG trigger.  That resulted in 8 eggs retrieved, 6 fertilized and none made it to day 5.  The next round we did a full dose lupron plus follistim, and no clomid or lupron at the trigger. That wound resulted in 6 eggs retrieved, 4 embryos and all were genetically normal.We are still in the process of a donor egg cycle. 1) Letrazole alone

2) Letrazole and IUI

3) Retrieval + single embryo transfer with 2 months of Lupron before transfer

4) donor eggs with antihistamine protocolI had gone to two previous doctors (and 5 previous embryo transfers of genetically normal embryos) and no one was able to find out what was wrong. At first she thought that I might have endometriosis and had me take a test that was relatively new to find out (I forget the name of it though). When that came back negative, she had me do an ERA test and we discovered that I might benefit from switching the protocol for progesterone and embryo transfer. I'm happy to say that that was successful and I am now entering my second trimester. I don't remember off hand my protocol but I know when I had my first consult I just had an IUI with another clinic and he told me to take a few months off & start fresh with him. It was the best advice he gave me and I truly think it made a huge difference.1st IUI. Letrizole, ovidrel, frozen donor sperm
2nd IUI letrizole, ovidrel, progesterone, estradiol, frozen donor sperm
3rd IUI, letrixole, ovidrel, progesterone, estradiol, frozen donor sperm He did not over Medicate like other clinics.  I don’t remember the rest but this stuck out the most IVF #1: Antagonist
IVF # 2: Antagonist with PICSI
IVF #3: Lupron One IUI, using letrozole and trigger. When the first 5 days of letrozole didn't give enough follicle growth, we did another 5, with a plan to move to clomid and then stronger drugs if needed. I did a trigger shot with ovidrel and an IUI 24 hours later. A pregnancy resulted. i did 2 different protcols- antagonist with menopur and follistim and then a lurpon microdose. I did the antagonist protocol for oocyte freezing.  I started with the patch and then once injections started I did Menopur and Follistim.We used an aggressive protocol due to my DOR. I believe it was micro-dose Lurton flare. I did micro dose lurpon morning and night as well as two vials menopur in the morning and 300 units Gonal-F at night.  I used an agonist/antagonist protocol for all of my cycles. I did a fresh transfer on all three during which I was trying to conceive. I got pregnant each time, although I unfortunately miscarried all of them, one of which we know was genetically normal. The protocol was Antagonist. I was on Lupron, Menopur and Gonal-F. Towards the end my Gonal-F was reduced several times because my body was responding so well. Changed protocol and monitored everything closely. I produced the most eggs in any of my 6 cycles in the 2 cycles with him. Surgeries went better and I recovered faster.Antihistamine protocol- because I have an autoimmune disease. Currently pregnantBefore the egg retrieval I was monitored almost every other day so that I wouldn't overstimulate. My medications were adjusted constantly.My IVF protocol was clomid 2 x a day, estrogen patch priming, steroid, 300 follistim, 150 menopur. FET I did the antihistamine protocol and the usual progesterone/estrogen protocol too. I did three rounds with a previous doctor, which resulted in 3 failed fresh transfers. Choi took great care to develop a protocol that worked for my body. We did 3 retrievals and froze all blasts for genetic testing. We transferred 2 of 3 embryos and are pregnant with twins.I did not respond to Clomid, so we used injectables in low doses. She explained the risks of multiples and her key concern was my safety and a healthy pregnancy.  Since I do not ovulate regularly, she correctly believed that it wasn't getting pregnant that was the issue, but rather getting me to ovulate!Estrogen patch to raise estradiol, birth control pills like provera to bring on a period, Clomid, Clomid-letrozolthere was: priming with patches then lupron and gonal and menapur combined with preganyl.  Primed with estrogen in luteal phase then injections menopur and follistim with ganirelix later.  I triggered with HCG and lupron to prevent OHSS because I was at risk with high estrogen.  17 eggs were retrieved and 14 mature frozen.  IVF. I don't recall the details (it was a cancelled cycle) IUIs with menopur shots and then ovidrel trigger3 IUIs, clomid assisted and then clomid and other medication assisted when the first trial didn’t work. 3 trials with negative result so we moved on to IVF. 

1 IVF, with what I now understand to be standard treatment regime:

Menopur
Gonal F 
Clomid 
Dexamethasone 
Follistim
Ganirelix/Cetrotide
HCG
Lupron 


Doxycycline (for Partner) 

Had great results that quickly dwindled. I had over 20 follicles. Only Pulled 12 eggs. 8 survived the night. 6 fertilized. 4 embryos made it to day 3-6. 

Then, PGS revealed 1 embryo to be viable. We were devastated. 

And then we weren’t...

Now we have 1 perfect, little girl. 
Overall strategy:

Genetic Testing for both me and my wife 

Sperm Analysis for myself 

Vericocele Surgery for me due to poor sperm analysis results. 

After 3 months of healing and timed intercourse we moved on to IUI. 

2 failed IUI’s pending results of 3rd. After undergoing 4 unsuccessful transfers at a different clinic, Dr. Levine took a look at our medical and embryo transfer history. At our first appointment he noticed that my previous doctor transferred 4 frozen embryos using the same exact protocol (natural cycle transfer). Dr Levine suggested that we would have success if we performed our next transfer during a controlled cycle.  The assumption is that my transplantation period was slightly off, or shorter than expected.  His assumption panned out and I was pregnant after just 1 transfer Mine was a standard egg retrevial/ freezing ... I appreciated the regular bloodwork and monitoring of the hormones I did two iui, one retrieval and three transfers. I used multiple methods to get my lining thicker each go around.Knopman educated me on all the pros and cons of each step along the way... This field is actually still new with developments every few months and they seem on top of all of that. If something doesn't feel right, ask questions... I was so relieved that Dr Levine has a single embryo transfer approach - I did not want twins! He had a strong preference to only transfer one embryo given our situation. We did IVF for PGD and not fertility issues so he was confident that a single embryo was the way to go and it worked on the first transfer!Did eSET as went with donor eggWe did a single embryo given that I was under 35 and we had unexplained infertility. It worked and we now have a beautiful baby girl. She and the entire clinic tends to only do single embryo transferHave not had an embryo transfer, although she was pretty straightforward in her belief to transfer singleWe only elected for one as he stated that was the safest route for me to go and I had a strong embryo to transfer so he felt that was the most important part to the puzzle.The clinic highly recommends a single transfer They only did single embryo transfer and do not recommend multiple as they select only the best quality embroyo.  CCRM NY recommends single embryo transfers, especially with CCS testing.Since we only had one embryp left. It was not relevant.This was a big discussion with between ourselves and Dr. Choi. She was very receptive to our thoughts and provided appropriate professional guidance. In the end because of my age (39) and history we went with a 2 embryo transferthey only transfer one embryo b/c they almost always require pgs testingDr. Choi was willing to do no more than a 2 embryo fresh transfer.  She warned against the risks of a multiple embryo transfer to both mom and baby.  Ultimately we opted for PGS testing tho.We haven't gotten to the FET stage as of yet, but I believe the clinic prefers FET over fresh embryo transfers. I also believe that eSET is the preferred method, but would suggest you chat with Dr Levine about your questions and concerns.None.We haven't done any transfers yet, but the CCRM clinic believes in a single embryo transfer approach. Less likely to conceive twins and less risky since I'm older.We eSET. I feel the eSET makes a lot of sense, though I know that not all clinics feel that way. Dr Talabian explained the benefits of eSET and my partner and I agreed that it was the best option for us. Committed to eSET. Due to having a history of stage 4 endometriosis and having a great egg quality, Dr. Levine recommended to have one embryo transferred as opposed to two which might put me at a higher risk.Dr Levine encouraged us to transfer one embryo due to the quality of the embryo and fact I had not been pregnant before - this approach was worth it as it worked. Being that it took us so long to get to pregnancy we were always in the mindset that we wanted to just put 2 in and hopefully get a jump start.  However, when it came down to it and we thoroughly discussed it with the Doc we all decided that it was safest and most effective to do one at a time.I only had one that tested healthy so not an option for 2. I think his preference for older patients and patients that already have a child is transferring 1 embryo. But he seems open to transferring 2 if that's what the patient wants. Not applicable in my situationNo - she is a strong believe in single transfers at my age and since they PGS test

My only outstanding question which i need to answer is how they handle mosaic embryosI only have 1 embryo so we're not having a conversation about single vs. multiple. Due to other medical issues, Dr. Levine thought it was safest to do a single embryo transfer. My husband and I were in complete agreement. Dr. Levine did not want to add any additional complications that could come with a multiples pregnancy into the equation. Dr. Levine’s goal is for each person to have a baby in the healthiest way possible.  As such, we implanted one embryo.  He had no reason to believe in our case that implanting 2 embryos would increase our odds of having one baby and furthermore could produce twins, which is higher risk for the mother and babies.  I was very nervous that our embryo was a grade 3.  He provided comfort to me by explaining how embryos of this grade aren’t as traumatized during embryo transfer and often implant better.  As I noted before, during the actual embryo transfer Dr. Levine explained his rational for the exact location of where he placed the embryo in the uterus.  This gave me a lot of comfort in knowing that everything he does has a specific purpose.Since we had such a good quality embryo that was genetically normal, we all agreed that transferring just one was the right move-- given my rather petite stature and prior history!We did not get into any details of embryo transfers because it wasn't part of our treatment plan.Dr. Levine highly recommended an eSET because we had a very high quality embryo to use. He said that the other two embryos were a bit lower quality, and so if we ever have another transfer, we may want to consider doing both at once to help improve the odds.

That said, he is generally opposed to multiple embryo transfer, as it is less healthy, even if it can help the odds.Dr. Levine will not implant more than two embryos.  no comment. We were interested in transferring all of our embryos when the time to increase our chances, especially given we were not PGD testing and given my advanced age.  He was reluctant to transfer more than 2.  Unfortunately, we never got to that stage.Dr. Levine did not have a preference.  We approached him with a desire to have one child as a sibling for our son who was born six years ago.We mutually decided on a single embryo transfer. The one thing I would have changed is to have opted out of PGS, but we made the best decision we could with the information we had at the time.eSET was recommended for me with donor eggs because of my age.Nawe did PGS and transferred a normal embryo. It implanted and am currently pregnantHe explained that single embryo transfer was best given our age and number of embryos availableI asked Dr. Knopman if I should do a one or two embryo transfer and she highly recommended only one which I was so happy I listened to her. She said due to how specific their technique is it would be likely that two would stick and since I'm young and petite there would be no reason unless I specifically wanted, to carry twins.Did not discuss yetNo commentsNaDr. Talebian suggested we may have to consider transferring two embryos when the time comes given my success so far. I did two day three transfers where I transferred three embryos. I also did one day 5 embryo where I transferred two embryos.  ",9.7,9.5,"two rounds of timed intercourse with letrazole I completed my retrevial with Dr. Knopman. We used a fresh sperm sample the day of the IUI with no male factor issues. I am so thankful he took the time to reassess and thought outside the box!I knew from a prior physician that I had diminished ovarian reserve (DOR). Different than my other cycles, he treated me like I had endometriosis even though I was not diagnosed with it based on what he saw at my retrieval. I was on Lupron, Menopur and Gonal-F. Towards the end my Gonal-F was reduced several times because my body was responding so well. We haven't done any transfers yet, but the CCRM clinic believes in a single embryo transfer approach."

Around $25,000We spent approximately 50,000 on 2 egg retrievals and 3 transfers at CCRM excluding meds.  24,000Egg retrieval ~$17,000 including monitoring, bloodwork, ICSI, CCS/PGS testing. Transfer ~$4800$20k without insuranceI thought the costs were reasonable for the level of care and services provided.The full IVF cycle is about $22,000. This includes everything (gentic testing, ICSI, all appointments, retrevial, transfer, one year of storage, etc )   Medication not included. $10K flat plus medications (About $7K for me)They were on par with what I’d expect for IVF in NYC.About $23,000 for the IVF cycle and transfer.  About $10,000 in medication and other costs (CCS testing, ultrasounds after transfer, etc.) This clinic was out of network for insurance, so cost significantly more than the clinic I was at previously. It was worth every penny Approximately 10,000Between 30-40K which included medication. The clinic itself was 22KCCRM does not take insurance but billing will do everything to make things easier on you. unsure as I have progyny and my IVF was covered177505-10KThe IVF cycle costed around $16K.  This does not include the initial consultation 
 and testing, medication, anesthesiology, or final frozen embryo transfer.I would recommend you ask for the billing costs. They sent a complete list of all procedures, codes for insurance if you have it, and the costs associated with each item. Costs for timed intercourse cycles were low -- medications were under $5. Trigger shots were closer to $200. IUI procedures were around $1K. And IVF is around $23K including PGS testing, biopsy, ICSI and assisted hatching. Medications we shopped around for the best prices at local and other pharmacies.  We were very fortunate to have fertility insurance through Progyny.  Out of pocket costs were for procedures co-pays and for medications.  I honestly forget the details but a cycle was around 20k?We had to pay $18,640.00 upfront. They offer access to CapexMed loans and other financing options. $18,000 injectables and retrieval. 
$10,000 freezing and transfer
$400 in house blood work for ovulation testEach retrieval round is around $20,000 and then medication costs are on top of that. Due to my Diminished Ovarian Reserve, I needed higher doses of the stimulation drugs for a longer than average period of time, driving up the cost even more. Had a frozen embryo transfer, genetic testing, medications, & icsi rounding up to a total of approximately 35k including visits, testing, bloodwork, my insurance unfortunately does not cover ivf.CCRM only accepts one type of insurance, so everything is out of pocket. The pricing seemed in line to what I have seen and read from other practices in NYC. The first consult has a charge of a few hundred dollars but it covers the consult, BW and US.  CCRM was very detailed with billing. They shared a lined item list of each step of the cycle and cost. There was a list of extra services as well that you could add to the cost. Total IVF cost was 24k not including medication. Complete cycle was around $22,000 with meds an additional $6,000-$8,000. I would say the cost are about average for treatment. The medications cost me $2,564.00 after insurance and the procedure was $10,090.00. I was lucky that insurance reimbursed for a lot of the medicine. I believe the IUIs were $1500-2000 each and the egg retrieval was around $15k - $20k and the FET was around $5k. This does not include the medicine which was an additional cost but insurance mostly covered. We have coverage through Progyny and had no issues with billing whatsoever. The costs seemed fair and at times were adjusted if money was tight.An IVF cycle ran about $21,000 and IUI cycle ran $3,000 to $5,000 depending on how long your cycle lasted.cost ended up being about 1500 per IUI cycleAbt 25k (+10k in medications)
We have UHC, about half was reimbursed being out of network 
But have to mention, was worth going out of network. Every single penny.It came to almost $30,000 for the procedures and medications. Medications were particularly expensive. I ended up getting back less than 1/3 of that from my insurance. This was for egg retrieval cycle that included one FET.We did 2 stim cycles, 1 FET and paid a total of $39,000$1000 for IUI plus 3 monitoring visits and blood tests ($325 each). Hysteroscopy $5000. Dr visit $300. Blood draw $25 (plus costs of test, usually covered by insurance). I don't actually remember, but I think that all in we probably spent ~$8,000 for three timed intercourse cycles and an IUI, the majority of which was reimbursed by my husband's insurance. It's looking like a cycle of IVF will be around $21K — not including medication and some other things we may need.i expect it to be around $25k plus medsThis has been a very expensive process, but the billing department has been very helpful in trying to help me get insurance coverage for whatever meds and procedures they can assist with. Medication, Genetic Testing, TransferEach visit is $250, with ultrasounds billed at $295. It is not covered by insurance, although they will submit it for you and it should count towards your deductible and out-of-pocket/out-of-network maximum. 

Blood work is a $25 copay with additional lab billing that's usually (for me) around $10. 

I have had two hysteroscapies with Dr. Levine (one to remove my septum) and I believe all-in, those costs were around $1500 each including anesthesia fees and copayment. CCRM does not take insurance and is expensive compared to other clinics.  But we paid for 1 expensive but successful cycle at CCRM and paid for 4 less expensive but unsuccessful cycles elsewhere.  The entire treatment was about $15,000 which is on the high end of egg freezing, however you get what you pay for. The care I received here was worth every penny.Including everything, such as medication, retrieval, transfers - about $40,000I don't remember the breakout, but it was around $25k total maybe?As a concierge office there are definitely increased costs associated with seeing Dr. Levine compared to other fertility specialists in the city. My husband and I opted to see another fertility specialist first because they were covered by insurance. I think this plan worked well for us because we got a diagnosis and started the treatment process with the treatment being covered by insurance. We quickly switched to Dr. Levine after the initial testing and I am so glad that we did. He is worth every penny. His office also helped a lot with submitting expenses to my insurance company for things that would be covered like blood testing so we actually got some money back as well. Dr. Levine is absolutely worth every cent of the investment it is to see him.For a retrieval and frozen embry transfer cycle, including ICSI, embryo biopsy and cryopresevation it was about $22,000.  In addition, the CCS testing ran anywhere from $500-1,500 (depending on how many embryos).

Note that if there isn't a viable embryo (so, no transfer), about $4,000 of the $22,000 could either be refunded to you or applied to another cycle.

None of this includes the medications.The clinic is very expensive and they do not accept insurance. I believe we paid several hundred dollars for every visit and upwards of $1000 for IUI.Approximately $20-$22K out of pocket. Drugs are not included in that figure.I believe $14k total. Would have been more had there been a transfer. In line with other clinicsApproximately $22k13K for freeze all cycle without PGD testing.  FET would’ve been an additional 5K.  20-30k for one IVF cycle$21000 for a single cycle retrieval and transfer all the way up to first ultrasound.  The costs were split usually as approximately $8000 for transfer and supporting protocols, and $11000 for retrieval, and about $1000 for anesthesia during retrieval.   This does not include cost of any injectable hormones or post-transfer patches/supposetries.350-400 per visit. Sperm wash and IUI more. They do not accept insurance, out of pocket was approximately 15k.I don't recall, we are very lucky to have incredible insurance.It has been very expensive. I don't recall Approximately 3000 per Iui cycle. The cycles are mostly all self-pay.Around 3000 total before insurance - I got 70 percent back. Ultrasounds were 300, the IUI was 725.

42,Sher Fertility of New York,doctor,"Dr. Dicken is a skilled doctor who is willing to treat patients with severely diminished ovarian reserve. I went to retrieval with an AFC of 7 and an AMH of below .4. She specializes in this type of treatment and did not overmedicate me, in order to avoid compromising the quality of remaining eggs. She was willing to incorporate HGH at my suggestion, based on outside research I had done. At one point we had some communication glitches, which resulted in our having to delay a cycle, but we came to learn this was more the result of failed communication between her and the office staff. We are very grateful to her for her willingness to help patients like me - she will go to retrieval for only one egg, because she understands how precious that one egg is. I have had an excellent experience so far with Dr Dicken, she has been present at every scan and been very forthcoming with information, describing her thought process step by step. She was much more thorough in the diagnostic workup and has found potential issues that other doctors had missed.Dr T really took the time to learn my entire background going back to teenage eating disorders to my current high blood pressure to recommend the next steps.  He was an amazing listener (my husband and I are both talkers!) and asked questions that we were able to fill in.  The day of our consultation we immediately got the ball rolling with an ultrasound and blood tests.Dr. Tortoriello was kind and communicative from the second I consulted with him.  I had previously been to another clinic where I felt like a number and that the clinic had decided I needed to undergo IVF before even diagnosing me or conducting any tests.  The experience with Dr. T was entirely opposite.  He wanted to make sure to explain things to me and would not provide an opinion as to the best course of action until he conducted preliminary tests/did a workup.  Dr. T communicated with my husband and me throughout all of the treatments we did.  I don’t have enough words to describe the great Doctor he is. He is smart and is very knowledgeable in the latest research. He always changed my plan according to my needs. If something didn’t work, he looked for a solution. In my case he found it and we are blessed today at my age 44 with my own eggs. This  is truly a blessing and miracle and It couldn’t happen without him.  He didn’t turn me away where others did so it speaks to his compassion. He is dedicated and very diligent. I always felt 100 trust in him and his approach.  He leveled with us when we asked the difficult questions and never gave us false hope... but somehow still managed to give us hope. I always felt relaxed with him because he is so easy going and very calm. That helps during such difficult times.  I will forever be grateful to him. I have a very tricky schedule living in NYC with two toddlers (one with special needs) and no family to help out so Dr. T was very flexible in my appointment scheduling which was such a relief because there was no way I could have attended other well known NYC clinics with my schedule. He always answered my questions via email or in person and I asked huge amount of questions. He was straight forward and honest but kind and compassionate at the same time. He was always right about my treatment. He is very professional, he answers all your questions and also is always available via email. He is kind and compassionate but also direct. Sometimes when you get bad news, you would prefer not to be direct but he isn’t dismissive of your hopes and dreams. We had two miscarriages with both of our transfers so the embryos likely had chromosomal abnormalities and he indicated this early on when signs showed it via sonogram but also let me have hope.  Honestly, when Dr. Wang left, I wanted to follow him to his new clinic. But because of various logistical reasons we decided to stay at SIRM. Dr. Dicken has been fantastic. As a poor responder, I appreciate that her protocol for our most recent freezing cycle hasn’t simply been a canned response. It is my great honor and pleasure to write this recommendation for Dr. Tortoriello. He is a miracle worker. After 2 successful IVF cycles at another boutique clinic (on East 69th St. in Manhattan) that resulted in 2 miscarriages at ~8 weeks (devastating), we switched to Dr. T. During my initial consult with Dr. T he recommended a different protocol, adding several new medications. On my 1st cycle with Dr. T, I became pregnant and successfully carried to term and delivered a beautiful baby boy into the world. 2 years later, we went back to Dr. T., the man worked his magic again, and voila, we now have baby boy #2. I intend to visit Dr. T again soon as my husband is eager for baby boy #3...ha! Dr Dicken was always available on email and very through during all the consults I had including phone consults. She is a very kind woman and made me feel empowered and involved in my treatment plan.  She never was condescending and she would get back to me with through responses via email during very stressful times and always put me at ease.He is patient and understanding of what his patients are going through.  He is also very candid but you have to ask a lot of questions and be an educated patient. I had to ask about other options available. At times, I felt as a number. On one occasion he misread my test results and didn’t realize until I questioned it.

He is very responsive to emails and gets back to you promptly which is great but his emails were abbreviated.Dr. Dicken was always clear, efficient, and realistic but positive. She responded to emails quickly, within 24 hours on weekends and much sooner during business hours. She easily answered any questions I had, and I always felt cared for. She went out of her way to support me when a cycle went awry financially and while it was a small thing for her, it made a huge difference to me. She responded conscientiously to my financial needs as well as my body to adjust treatment and I never felt like I wasn't getting the best care just because I couldn't afford every option. Dr. Wang truly listens to his patients' concerns and does his best to answer any questions with complete honesty. Every time I asked him something, he was quick to offer his suggestions and feedback about what he think would work best for my cycle. At every appointment he sat with me for a few extra minutes so that he could answer all of my questions. I never felt rushed! He never hesitated to make sure I felt comfortable with the course of action. Dr. Wang is a very knowledgeable and compassionate doctor.  He takes the time to answer all of your questions thoroughly. It is amazing and refreshing that patients are able to contact him directly instead of just communicating via nurses. Dr Wang understands that the infertility journey is difficult, scary, and ambiguous.  He is open to ideas from his patients, but he will also tell you when he disagrees and the reasons why.  You also never feel like his recommendations are just part of a script.  Your protocols and other tests are always done for a specific reason and he will tell you those reasons.  His bedside manner is warm, friendly, and compassionate.  He takes the time to communicate both good and difficult information directly to his patients.  
Perhaps the only criticism is that sometimes he will leave some decisions up to his patients when sometimes as a patient you just want to be told what to do. However, he only does this when the outcome for either decision will remain unknown until tried, as every individual will react differently and there is know way to know ahead of time.  
Above all, you feel like you are part of a true doctor-patient relationship with Dr Wang and you feel like you can trust his recommendations.  Even when some cycles don't work out as you hoped, you never feel like noone was watching or that a true attempt wasn't made.  And that makes such a difference in the journey. Dr T is a wonderful person, and I feel safe and well cared for with him. He knows his stuff and has zero ego. He is open to experimental treatment but committed to the standard fundamentals.
I did have two failed transfers with him, however, with tested embryos. He recommended a very different protocol than I had had previously, and I wonder if it was too different, or too out there. His protocol included things like prednisone and intralipids, which I know are controversial. 
When I wanted to switch back to a more standard protocol he was very supportive, and so far this one has worked (I'm 11 weeks). I would feel very comfortable going to him for a future cycle. I met with a RE at another clinic before working with Dr. Tortoriello and the experience was like night and day. While the other physician had zero beside manner and barely let me speak, Dr. T really explained everything and answered all my questions. You can tell he cares deeply about patients, and I never felt like a number. I could email him and he would reply very quickly. If I pursue more IVF, it would definitely be under his care.I can't stress this enough: if you have been to other clinics and have had failed IVF cycles but you are not done fighting infertility yet, you absolutely need to go see Jeff. He treats you with so much compassion and he is the very best at what he does. He tested us for things that other clinics either overlooked and blew off, or didn't bother to look into at all. We aren't pregnant yet, but we have plan of action and Jeff is so patient about working with us through that plan. If he can't help us get pregnant, I am convinced no RE can. My background - I started seeing Dr. Wang after a terrible experience at another clinic. He was immediately completely different from what I had experienced at a much bigger clinic. He is patient and kind and thoughtful and researches your case. His responses to your emails are extremely thorough. When I did a test with him (EFT test for implantation and it came back with suspected endometriosis) - he referred me to someone outside of their practice for further diagnosis and surgery. When I didn't agree with Dr Wangs suggestion of taking Lupron and forgoing the surgery, he was very agreeable and worked with the surgeon and continued to be responsive and available. I really valued that even when I went to  see someone else he was still open to hearing opinions and thoughts.  I felt at ease with Dr. Tortoriello during my first consultation with him.  He is very soft spoken as well as very thorough in explaining the pros and cons, as well as answering all of my questions.  It was very easy to make my decision to pick him to be my fertility doctor.  Any other consultations I had at other clinics made me feel like a number and not a human.  He always made me feel like a human.

During my treatment with Dr. Tortoriello, he was always very personable and accessible.  There was never a time that I did not get a call back or an email reply to my questions or concerns during treatment.  

She was so positive and encouraging. She was open to my own ideas and made me feel like we were partnering and not like I was a science project. At the same time she is professional knowledgeable and made a protocol that didn’t feel cookie cutter. He is my second IVF doctor and was a breath of fresh air. I genuinely felt he was my partner in this process...which was a big deal for me as my husband travels a lot and it's easy to get overwhelmed if you are doing a lot of this immense process alone.  His warmth and intellect I found to be a perfect combination.We found Dr. Dicken to be a consummate professional who gave us clear information and took the time to explain things when we had questions. She was encouraging but was always clear about risks and the probability of success. Dr. Dicken also remained available to us when we had questions for her. She responded promptly to emails and made sure that her staff followed up when necessary. We saw her at every appointment that involved a doctor. 
It is hard to overstate how important this was for us. We went to Dr. Dicken after first seeing a well-known doctor at a major facility who we found cold, remote and insensitive. By contrast, we felt comfortable with Dr. Dicken as our guide through this sometimes difficult process. After some setbacks, we were blessed with a beautiful baby boy and we are eternally grateful to Dr. Dicken for her help in getting us there. Dr T was fantastic from my consultation wiith him to having 17 embryos frozen! Having infertility issues is devestating but finding a doctor like him and now being able to plan a family is amazing. I am grateful for meeting him. Every appt I had with him was comfortable and fast. I would sometimes go on my lunch break and didn’t have to take much time off of work. During my egg retrieval he was calm and patient and caring and checked up on me afterwards to make sure I didn’t have complications. I plan on using his services when I am ready to implant. Again, I can't say just how amazing he is. Smart, compassionate, and extremely responsive.  I've dealt with other doctors for fertility and none of them can hold a candle to this doctor not even the doctors at NYU or Cornell.

The only thing I wish is that prior to my third transfer we should have done more tests.   He is a wonderful human being. I felt that he took my questions seriously and was patient driven. I had some questions about protocols and he explained why he suggested the protocol and why some protocols wouldn't be beneficial for me. He has a reassuring way to him, this process can lead to so many worries but I felt like I was able to trust in the process because of him.Dr. Wang is the most compassionate doctor with a great bedside manner. He is quick to respond to any and all questions that I may have (especially when I start to question or overthink everything or when I'm in a panic). He really is on this journey with you, and is rooting for you to have your dreams realized.  He is very soft-spoken and gentle mannered. While I appreciate this, I do feel like sometimes you have to be a little more forceful in telling him you want something done.She was caring, compassionate, and professional. She is a great communicator, easily reachable via email for questions/concerns. She performed every procedure and saw us for 99% of our visits.We felt like we were seen and heard and treated like individuals.Dr. Dicken is the best doctor I've ever had...I often say to friends and family that I wish Dr. Dicken could be my doctor for everything! It's a very difficult process, but I got better results each cycle and didn't give up because of her excellent care. She is very thorough, pragmatic, and individualizes treatment. She found a number of things that were missed by my previous doctor. She explains treatment and procedures, so that you know her rationale and what to expect. She always has recommendations to improve the next cycle, and her recommendations always are a good balance of proven treatments and the latest research.Dr Wang is the best doctor I've ever had (and I had been to several other clinics before).  He spends lots of time with you reviewing everything.  He answers emails all day and night and provides in depth explanations.  I never waited longer than a couple of hours for a response even when he was in another country! He is caring and compassionate.  Very open to new ideas.  He was the one that figured out I had silent endo and suggested a treatment path.  Most other docs keep just doing ivf after ivf without trying to find what is wrong. I would recommend him to anyone.  He is truly amazing and I'm so glad I found him!If you have DOR or egg quality issues RUN to Dr Wang. I live in MA but traveled to NYC to cycle with him (did monitoring in Boston). I had 2 doctors in Boston tell me I might need donor eggs at 34 and with already having a naturally conceived child, and that seemed crazy. My first cycle in Boston was cancelled before retrieval due to no response (MGH). My second one in Boston got a good number of eggs for me (11) but nothing made it to day 5.... after this I wondered if I would never have another child. I read about Dr Wang on a fertility chat board and made a phone consult. What I loved about him is unlike the docs in Boston who had a very cookie cutter approach, he was willing to think out of the box. Like whereas they said I should do a 5 day transfer, he said sometimes those with quality issues do better on day 3 (which happened for me). While the Boston docs thought the problems were all me since my husband's sperm was always normal, he thought due to terrible quality of embryos on one cycle, it was worth doing a sperm DNA fragmentation test (which showed abnormality) and so we used PICSI in this cycle (no on in Bos would do it). He allowed HGH because while he agreed with Bos docs that it often doesn't help, it sometimes can, and when I told him I wanted to throw the kitchen sink at this, he said great..... His stance on many issues was ""if it won't hurt and there's some evidence to suggest it will heko, let's do it"" (eg giving me low dose prednisoe because i have an autoimmune disease)

He responded to EVERY email I sent within 12 hours max, often in 20 mins. This includes emails sent in the middle of the night .... at other clinics the docs didn't even answer email, it was all filtered through nurses Dr. Dicken made me feel like I was her only patient. She was compassionate, accessible, has a strong command for her field and can explain things in terms that are easy for a non-medically trained person to understand. Dr. Dicken was the second doctor I saw after 2 failed IVF transfers with Greenwich Fertility and several IUI’s. On the first IVF transfer Dr. Dicken performed, I conceived. She treated me for having overactive natural killer cells, PCOS and hormonal imbalance. Whether via email or in person, Dr. Dicken was readily available to me and my husband during a very challenging time. We are grateful for our newborn son who was born just 13 months after our first time meeting with Dr. Dicken. Dr. Wang is a patient, kind doctor who treats you like a partner on the fertility journey.  He explains everything and always treated me with the utmost respect.  He shared equally in our disappointment when there were setbacks and in our happiness when I got pregnant.  I always saw him (with the exception of one visit when he was on vacation).Dr. Dicken is up to date with the latest research, explains her opinion to our questions directly with the positives/negatives, shows compassion/empathy to the tough situation we are in, typically responds to our questions within hours, has a kind/understanding ""bedside manner"", remembers our preferences for almost every issue (e.g. preference for how medicated we want our cycle to be, how we prefer to take medication), is very sensitive to how we react to the medication, and basically goes ABOVE AND BEYOND IN EVERY SITUATION to provide excellent patient care.
I will say that I am impressed with Dr. Dicken's ability to help us improve our egg quantity during a cycle that was initially bound for failure.  We had 8 eggs retrieved after she greatly lengthened our protocol. That said, I have read that longer stim protocols more often result in poorer outcomes. I wish she had iterated that information to us in order to help us make a decision about continuing with the cycle.

Overall, Dr. Dicken disappointed us greatly.  She failed to communicate important information to me and my partner several times which nearly cost us a cycle and caused emotional distress while we awaited our results FOR EIGHT DAYS! We also felt she didn't even take the time to read our notes before checking in with us during apts. Ie. In a conversation with me she did not remember my partner's name nor the fact that we'd opted for PICSI. I am also very concerned that the lab did not provide me with an embryology report---vital information for our next cycle.  Switching to Dr. Wang after my original doctor gave me the donor egg speech was like switching between night and day.   He was candid about his expectations and limitations and was the first to say he was cautiously optimistic.  He doesn't make promises, but he works the hardest anyone can to help you bring home a baby.  He's also incredibly articulate, which my husband and I found invaluable as both of us are fact driven people who want to know as much as possible in order to feel secure about our choices.  Dr. Wang always answered questions well the first time so I didn't have to ask for further clarification or wonder what he meant or feel like he didn't understand my question.  With Dr. Wang, I go to sleep at night knowing that we're in excellent hands and even if we don't end up having children, we both know we tried everything and won't have regrets. He explains things calmly and in detail.  I saw him at every visit except one weekend monitoring.  I trust his judgement and results were close to what he had predicted.  For my 2nd round I requested he change one aspect of treatment and he agreed to do so.  He responds to emails very quickly which reassures me that my treatment is important.Dr. O'Shaughnessy is very experienced and authoritative. She made me feel at ease after a bad experience at another clinic. She is very matter of fact, which for me, works well. She gives the facts and doesn't necessarily add much color commentary. She is responsive by email and also makes time available to talk on the phone. Dr. Wang is incredibly kind and compassionate. He listens and involves me and my husband with every step of the journey. How many doctors can you email personally and who actually find the time to write you back? I can tell you at least in my experienc - one! And it's Dr. Wang. He has gone above and beyond to help us, and I will never go to another doctor. I feel like we are partners in my care. I can't say enough about him. Just go to him - you won't regret it.Dr. Wang was a gift to my husband and I after four very difficult pregnancy losses.  He created a unique plan that was tailored to our case that helped us to generate many more embryos than  previous cycles and resulted in a pregnancy.  He responded to every question I asked with care and helped me to truly understand the reasons behind my treatments/care.  Dr. Wang is one of a kind and his care is unparalleled.  He is an incredible combination of scientist, practitioner, and counselor.  I have never met a doctor with better ""bed-side manner."" We could not survive infertility/RPL without him.  He has your back and will see you through. Dr. Dicken is great. She took the time in our first consultation to review our charts (from another clinic), give us her opinion and talk about ALL the options - something we did not get at our previous clinic. She is open-minded, caring, thorough and very responsive to all our questions in person and via emails. I feel very taken care of in a personal way with her. Again, Dr. Dicken was warm, friendly, available and kept my feelings in mind during a difficult time. She didn't withhold information or try to sugar coat anything, but she was clearly rooting for our success. At another clinic, I sometimes felt like their course of action was motivated more by their need to keep up their success rates.  Dr. T was my first fertility doctor.  (i saw one before him like a consult but never followed through because it was like a meat factory. ) I can't imagine any improvement except for the fact that his monitoring starts later than I was expecting, so i had to make some plans at work to accomodate that. Totally worth it though because I got to see him each time.Dr. T has a very deliberative manner and makes it very clear that he takes your care seriously. Although I saw the other two doctors in the clinic for some of the procedures because of scheduling, Dr. T did all of his own monitoring rather than having technicians do them. I wasn't sure if I would care one way or the other, since in the first clinic I went to, the monitoring was done by techs and I loved those ladies, in the end I think I felt more comfortable with Dr. T doing the monitoring simply because it meant that I saw him all the time and felt like I had many opportunities to ask any questions I may have had. He never sugarcoated what was going on, but neither was he pessimistic. I appreciated his balanced attitude.At our initial meeting, I thought Dr. Dicken was incredible (she still is).  She was knowledgeable with just the right amount of empathy and professionalism.  We went into detail about my concerns.  On the day that we met, I got a surprise positive pregnancy test.  I emailed Dr. Dicken and asked if I could use the progesterone that she had prescribed for my upcoming IUI.  She responded quickly and gave me the go-ahead to use the progesterone.  Unfortunately, that pregnancy ended in a miscarriage.  

Once my first period showed, I went back to SIRM for the IUI.  Dr. Dicken was available for the first ultrasound.  She explained that she would be out of office over the weekend and that I would see another doctor.  Dr. O’Shaughnessy was neither warm nor patient centered.  She gave me minimal information during the ultrasound.  It felt very impersonal.  Still, I figured its only one appointment.  

I was called that afternoon and told to trigger the next day and come in 2 days after.  In that time, I emailed Dr. Dicken about my positive OPK.  She assured me that I wasn't ovulating yet.  I apologized profusely for constantly emailing her.  I was having a tough time.  She never responded to my email.  Okay.  I figured I was going to be seeing her anyway.  

On the morning of the IUI, I was told that the Doctor was with someone else and would be with me soon.  I was taken to a room to undress.  I was very surprised to see Dr. O’Shaughnessy walk in.  I was baffled.  One of the reasons I chose SIRM was the fact that they did things differently.  Now, I understand that emergencies happen.  What was confusing to me was why no one could let me know that my Doctor was not available.  Dr. O’Shaughnessy was very rough.  This was my third and most painful IUI ever.  She didn't even say what she was doing.  She just rammed the speculum and catheter inside of me.  She gave me no instruction (even about the progesterone).  Didn't tell me how long to lay down for either.  I didn't even hear a good luck.  I waited 20 minutes, dressed and left quietly.  

Downstairs in the car, I cried my eyes out.  I guess my doctor was busy with another procedure.  I just felt like my procedure was not important.  She did the old bait and switch on me and I did not appreciate it.  The whole ""patient centered"" thing is nonsense.  I don't think I'll even bother going in for beta.  Dr. Dicken is an amazing doctor. She was constantly present wether it was during a visit, over the phone and through email. She answered every question clearly and non-judgmental can, even if it was a question that I had asked a ton of times before. I felt she truly understood what U was going through not only medically and emotionally and handle it in a delicate manner but still direct and professionally. When I found out I was pregnant she was just as excited for me. I thought that was amazing because she sees so many people. But I felt I was the only one. I found Dr. T after being dissatisfied with the care at another practice.  I did a lot of research and chose to move to Sher so I could be treated by Dr. T.  This was the best decision I made as he is truly one of a kind.  I had ‘unexplained’ infertility and nothing seemed to be working, despite seemingly endless tests and attempts.  After some time under his care Dr. T believed I had silent endometriosis and other immunological issues.  He referred me to a specialist who was able to remove my endometriosis surgically and he worked with that practice to continue my treatment until he delivered the amazing news that I was finally pregnant!! Throughout my time there, Dr. T always remained positive and always approached us with new ideas on how to change course (we requested this).  He dealt gracefully and calmly with my sometimes unpleasant and frustrated attitude.  His responsiveness to emails was extremely valuable to me, as I often emailed him frantically about my case. 10 months after I had my daughter I found out I was pregnant again (naturally!) and my OBGYN was concerned that my hormone levels were very low, he was certain it was a bad pregnancy.  I quickly emailed Dr. T, whom I hadn’t spoken to in over a year and asked his opinion.  He was, as always, honest but hopeful.  That pregnancy ended in a perfectly healthy baby.  I will always be thankful to him for finally diagnosing my issue and providing a solution, and ultimately being responsible for the two beauties that are now in our lives! I cannot forget to also acknowledge the nurses and other doctors in the practice who were all so wonderful as well.  This is truly a special practice.

Dr. Cary Dicken is very understanding and top-notch in her field. We did one round of IVF with my own eggs with her and we got pregnant immediately. Before, we did an IUI with her which didn't result in a pregnancy. She advised us to go do IVF to increase our chances which we did and ended up with a beautiful baby boy. I saw Dr. Dicken every visit (apart from the egg retrieval which was on a weekend with another great doctor on duty). She always made me feel good and optimistic about the whole process. I especially liked that she also answers emails quickly and detailed. Dr. Dicken explains things very easily which was important since I am not a native speaker. I felt that she did her best in giving us the best chance to conceive.  What I like most about her is her warm, caring personality. I would recommend her to anybody who wants to do IVF.Dr. Dicken is very knowledgeable, and thoroughly explains every step of the process.  From our first meeting, I trusted her expertise and knew I was in capable hands.  She helps you decide what is best for you as a couple and doesn't force anything on you.  Moreover, Dr. Dicken is kind and friendly, which made the whole process less intimidating.  I cannot recommend her highly enough!  After initially being treated at Cornell for 4 failed cycles, I switched to Dr. T after my original doctor suggested using a surrogate. Although I should have been a very easy case (blocked tubes and a history of prior successful pregnancies, I was diagnosed with implantation failure. Dr. Tortoriello did a full and thorough work up with different testing and was willing and able to think outside of the box. This was EXACTLY what I needed. We transferred my last 3 frozen embryos - the ones that had been picked over each prior transfer - and it finally worked. I only kick myself for not going to him sooner. 
Dr. T is kind, compassionate to a point but also realistic. During our consultations, he didn't sugar coat things and gives you the honest facts. This was actually a little hard for me as a patient since I prefer a hand holder and a little more optimism. But he wholeheartedly wants it to work for his patients without making promises.  During procedures and monitoring, he was upbeat and reassuring. 
I will 1000% be going back to him again. When everyone had given up on me, he made it happen. Dr. Dicken started treatment by meeting with my husband and I for a long period of time, covering every detail of our history. She then laid out a course of potential next steps and treatment, explaining the level of invasiveness of each step. She recommended starting with the least invasive course to gather information and then proceeding from there. She explained the details and purpose of each test and treatment in detail. We were experiencing recurrent miscarriages and she recommended genetic testing for both parents, and a round of Clomid based on our discussion of the timing of my cycles, in an attempt to control the timing of ovulation and improve egg quality. She discovered a few genetic mutations on my genetic test that can affect folic acid levels and can contribute to clotting, resulting in pregnancy loss. She prescribed medications to address the issue and I become pregnant with my son the next cycle abd delivered a healthy baby in September 2016. I saw Dr. Wang after being treated (unsuccessfully) by another doctor at a different clinic.  I was looking for a fresh perspective on my case and the possibility of doing additional testing to uncover potential issues (I had endometriosis and a blocked tube).  I only wish I had gone sooner to Dr. Wang!  He is an incredible listener and has a way of explaining information to patients that is clear, concise, and makes sense.  He has the ability to think outside the box and is willing to try things and always work with the patient.  His communication is top notch - always responding to patient concerns or questions quickly and thoroughly.  I was never made to feel like a question was a stupid one or a bother.  He was able to suggest additional tests that did confirm I needed some extra treatments around immunological issues and uterine receptivity issues.  He always sees patients promptly and gives them 100% of his attention.  Words really can't describe how great Dr. Wang is.My experience with SHER- NY was amazing. EVERYONE, from nurses to receptionists are welcoming and sensitive to your needs. Dr. O was always readily available via email, even responding on weekends and vacations. The ONLY time another doctor at the practice treated me, Dr. O called me just before the appointment to go over everything 1 more time. She is wonderful.Dr. Wang was truly an excellent doctor who made us feel at home; even in the SIRM office. He always answered every question with honesty, he never gave us false hopes, but he also didn't beat us down with age related facts, as he knew , we already  knew them. He was a realist and I appreactaed that. He gets back to emails quickly, and doesn't miss a beat as far as leaving any stone unturned. Our insurance doesn't cover IVf treatments, so unfortunately we were priced out of SIRM, but even now, I am not his patient yet he still responds and answers my questions, faster and with more definition then my current doctor.Dr. Dicken was thorough and effective in identifying some problems I had with tubal blockage and low egg reserve. She also tested my husband's doer for amount and quality which were fine. She took me step by step through the process of IUI then IVF until I had my baby. I had a hysterioscopy first to clear my tubes. Then I started hormones and had to undergo three IUI. Dr. Dicken explained that IVF was more effective but I needed IUI's done before my insurance would cover IVF. She was correct. The second IVF resulted in a pregnancy. That IVF I didn't even need injections, just medications. 

The first IVF I think was rushed because she was trying to get it done before she herself left to have a baby. But the second round went perfectly.

Dr. Dicken was patient with my constant questions and responded to a million emails. Dr. Dicken is in a league of her own.  Her attitude and knowledge made for an excellent IVF experience.  My wife and I were not only blessed with a positive outcome, but also felt totally cared for along the way.  After quite a bit of fertility research, we had an initial meeting with Dr. Dicken to discuss our options.  We quickly knew she was the best doctor and Sher the right practice to help us expand our family.  The IVF process can seem quite overwhelming.  Dr. Dicken and the wonderful staff at Sher made sure we had all appointments, calendars, RX’s, and most importantly knowledge along the way.  The office is run like a well-oiled machine- rarely a wait, efficient and caring nurses, insurance know-how, and all services onsite.  Another couple friend worked with Dr. Dicken/Sher as well; they had the same excellent results and glowing feedback.  We enthusiastically recommend Dr. Dicken and Sher to anyone in need of their expertise.  Our dream came true thanks to Dr. Drew Tortoriello

Everything began four years ago when we decided to start family. We tried to get pregnant for year with no luck met. That time I went to see my ob/gyn who sent us for some tests. We were confused, sad and depressed. She told us that IVF is our only option. So we went to clinic that was closest to our hometown. Doctors explained us what should we expect, but after failed IUI, IVF cycles and one miscarriage we were disappointed. We did not know what to do next, stay with clinic that follow protocol and won't make any changes or find someone else who can help us. At that time, I met a friend who was doctor’s T. patient and who got pregnant after first cycle of IVF in her 40s. So we called dr. T. office to make apt. and it was best decision of our live. Doctor Tortoriello is caring, knowledgeable and professional. He is always available to his patients, even when he is not in his office. We again ALWAYS received an answer within 5 minutes. He run tests, gave us hope and came up with a plan. After couple additional tests we were diagnosed with thyroid problems, endometriosis and my husband has low sperm count. We also had prolactin level problems and high alfa cells counts. We did not succeed with the first approach, but it gave doctor enough information to optimize and individualize approach. Right now, it is middle of the night when we are writing it, and we are not sleeping because we have a small miracle that is crying by our side since she is hungry. We are happiest since this is something that wouldn't be possible without doctor T. What we want to say is beyond 5 stars, excellent service etc. He helped us made life dream come true, so make appointment with him and you will see by yourself. THANK YOU DR. TORTORIELLO and SHER INSTITUTE FOR OUR BEAUTIFUL BABY GIRL AIMEE :)
She is an extremely compassionate and competent doctor. Well informed and communicates clearly with her patients - and maybe most importantly listens to the patients and reassures them. The doctor was very reachable and seemed very open in her communication.  I cannot fully trust that the large number of tests that totaled more than $5,000 were only driven by necessity and not by the clinic's desires to make additional money ( tests were not covered by insurance).  My cycle at the institute (which was my third IVF - and i""m a normal 35 yo  with no known problems) did not succeed, so I have mixed feelings about the Dr., who seemed to be very convinced of success rates. Also, she put me on lupron depot which was probably the worst kind of medication for my body so far. I never was told of the side effects , and in my case happened to be quite bad.
My Dr had left the practice rather suddenly and I appreciated Dr Dicken taking over my care.  We discussed treatment and she said she treated similarly to the Dr I had been seeing.  I don't know that she could have done anything better medically, although perhaps if she had seen me as more of her patient and not someone who was out of state and just coming for retrieval - My issue with Dr Dicken was her bedside manner.  She was unapproachable, unavailable and very cold.  On the few occassions we did see her, she kept us waiting for hours, acted very nonchalantly, and didn't seem invested in me as her patient. On Day 5, no one called me with results, and when I called, I was told it was too late in the day to get news.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Anyone who has undergone IVF and is waiting for day 5 to learn about their embryos knows no call is unacceptable.  That evening I received an email from Dr Dicken stating my embryos didn't survive.  It was two sentences - with zero kindness or compassion.  It was an awful way to learn the outcome.  I refused to see Dr Dicken again.""The best ever RE you can find on the East Coast! Not only in the state of NY, but for the entire East Coast! After being a patient to many other REs, once I met Dr. Wang, I knew he was the RE I needed! We have our miracle son due to his fantastic work, incredible bedside manners, extreme knowledge of protocols and customizing treatments for his patient’s needs. Can’t say enough great things about Dr. Wang and his team! Extraordinary person with charismatic personality and fantastic mind! THANK YOU DR. Wang for making it happen for us after 6 years wait! WE LOVE YOU!!! Forever grateful!”Dr. Dicken is a knowledgeable doctor with excellent bedside manner. She is easy to talk to and cares about her patients. She thoroughly answers all questions her patients have and makes herself available by email which was a real blessing. I felt comfortable asking her questions that may have otherwise been uncomfortable to ask should I have had a different doctor (about bleeding I was having etc). I attribute this to her warm, easy-going personality.  

I went through 2 IVF cycles with Dr. Dicken and the 2nd cycle resulted in my husband and I having two beautiful twin boys! We couldn't be happier with our experience and highly recommend Dr. Dicken to anyone considering IVF treatment. Dr. O'Shaughnessy is a great Dr. She has years of experience and I felt very confident from the beginning that the protocol she was using was the best for my case. She was not a great communicator, but I was a satellite patient so I never met her until my retrieval. Dr. O can be very blunt in her tone, but she wants the very best outcome. She is very direct and honest regarding your chances and your results. I consulted with four Dr's I had recommendations for. She was the only one who went thru my bloodwork thoroughly. If you are a satellite patient (meaning your doing all your monitoring at another facility) you just have to make sure you stay on top of your results, and ask a lot of questions. From a surgical stand point, I felt very confident with her and her team. This doctor is very easy to talk to and answers his emails within a few hours. He is very compassionate and caring. He listens to you and takes your ideas into account. My first IVF with him resulted in 36 eggs and 22 embryos that ALL arrested on day 3. It was a complete shock that not even one made it to blastocyst. He called me himself with this news and stayed on the phone with me as long as I needed him to. We did another IVF with him in which I also produced 36 eggs and 22 embryos. He called saying they werent looking good on day 3 and I begged if I can come in and transfer 2 to see if maybe they would survive better inside me than in a petrie dish. He agreed. This ended up being a chemical pregnancy. All my other embryos did arrest. This dr was very sensitive when delivering such delicate news. He even admitted to try another clinic to see how my embryos would grow there. Its been 4 years since being treated by him and we still keep in contact. He is a very honest and kind dr. I wish it would have worked out by him.There aren't enough words in the English language to cover my admiration, appreciation, and respect for Dr. Wang.  He kept us involved in the process, answered emails at all hours, was open to our ideas, and fully made it a ""team"" effort.  He grieved our setbacks with us and plotted a new course, and celebrated our victories, including the birth of our child, with us.He gave us the opportunity to have the kids that we were having trouble getting. However the odds of Multiples the second time around were obviously WAY off base. We wanted a girl and transferred 2 embryos (the only girl we had and one boy) to increase the chance of one taking. We were given a less than 5% chance that they would both take and of course they both did. Now after PGD screening of the embryos and >$100,000 spent and 7 miserable years trying to build a family destroying my wifes body we have our first child and the twins with the boy twin being terribly sick with a very rare genetic mutation called CTNNB1 Haploinsufficiency that essentially means severe mental retardation and severe Cerebral palsy. SO we in essence gave up the best years of our lives to create a sick child that will drain us financially and emotionally for the rest of our lives- not to mention how it will mess up our children.I already covered this in the why I felt like a human rather than a number section, and this interface won't let me cut and paste so unfortunately if you want more coherence you're going to have to refer to my previous answer. Short version, Dr. Tortoriello:

-- listened to me
-- was never patronizing or dismissive of my questions
-- never discouraged me from doing my own research
-- was kind 
-- was a straight talker about my treatment details
-- had a good sense of humor
-- was deft and gentle in his touch with both ultrasound and during retrievals
He combines facts/figures with also the emotional piece. Didn't shy away from any topic. Gave us realistic picture but also hope. I'm glad we were recommended to him by friends who also had success. More importantly, seems to be very ethical--never wanted to go over board with drugs, used by own cycle at least to try to see if it would work (did), never suggested we transfer too many, respected our decisionsDr. T put me at ease during every appointment. He has an extremely calm bedside manner and explained what we were trying to accomplish at the beginning of every appointment. When we had an unsuccessful frozen embryo transfer, I felt that he truly took the results personally and had a different path to my care for the following attempt. I trust his professional judgment.He suggested that I monitor in NYC instead of locally because he felt like my monitoring clinic wasn’t good. They are. I got pregnant using their labs before with a different dr. who retired from Sher, two yrs earlier. I live 1,000 miles away, not happening. He was not very caring or compassionate. My wife had a serious complication that resulted from ovarian over-stimulation. She wound up in the hospital. Dr. Tortoriello actively participated in her treatment and remotely was able to correctly diagnose my wife's condition. His correct diagnosis allowed us to avoid a very dangerous surgery proposed by the hospital staff. For that, we are eternally gratefulHonestly, even if this doesn't work, I'm glad we tried our 2nd IVF with Dr. Dicken instead of staying at our old clinic. The experience has felt much more respectful and caring. She listens, explains things patiently, and tries to be prepared for all roadblocks. Dr. Wang is very responsive. He takes his time to answer all the questions.  Does not rush. After each setback he is eager to learn from the past and do testing to assure positive results in the future.  I feel like he really cares to help me. Warm, compassionate, calming presence. Matter of fact about all aspects of treatment. Always reachable, provided us with his cell and direct email. Selected the appropriate protocol given our infertility factors and history.Dr. Dicken missed some red flags in my blood results which led to me experiencing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).  This syndrome is painful and caused my IVF cycle to be delayed.  Subsequently, a frozen IVF cycle rather than a fresh transfer was the only recourse for that cycle.Dr. T meticulously managed my case/care. While my AMH and FSH numbers were low-normal, i responded as if my ovarian health was much worse off. During my first two attempts, I had shown signs of ovulating through my meds. Instead of Dr T pushing through, he advised we cancel, convert to an IUI and revise our strategy.

He monitored me every single day to avoid this happening our 3rd time. 

During our 3rd attempt, we did slow stimming and I had one embryo. This turned out to be my healthy and adorable daughter. We're planning to go back within the year to give her a sibling. 

If you have any doubts regarding your RE, go to dr. T!!! He is amazing. Dr. Dicken is qualified and professional. I am very happy that I was able to deliver a healthy child with her intervention. She was flexible about trying both IUI with my own eggs and transfer of donated embryos, as well as with different levels of medication with each IUI.My experience as a patient was excellent. I was extremely nervous visiting Dr. Tortoriello because I was heavily bleeding and did not know why. Dr. T made sure I did multiple tests to diagnose my situation. He prescribed an endometrial biopsy, sonogram, and inter uterine sonogram.  Once he diagnosed the fibroid pressing on my uterus, he knew I needed a hormone shot, medicine and surgical procedures. All went very well and the bleeding has stopped! 
I didn't feel like a number, I felt like a patient who was cared about. 
Dr. T. always remembered my case and plus he even wrote me in between visits to check on me.
My experience with him has been wonderful. Thank you Dr. T!Dr. Dicken was very professional, accomodating and understanding. She is  easy to reach and answers emails promptly.  All appointments were right on schedule, never felt rushed and all questions were answered.  Was pleased to know that patients' requests and considerations  regarding treatment plan were taken into account and changes were made as needed during treatment plan. Good to know that patient's opinion also means something during this difficult journey.He is just a very kind man who cares. You can tell. He never rushed me and answered my emails, sometimes late at night, all the time.  He was very realistic without dashing my dreams and prayers.  He is incredibly busy but somehow always reached out to me to see how I was doing.  Love that man.Dr. Wang is everything one could hope for in an RE.  He is kind, compassionate, knowledgeable, thorough, communicative, progressive...I could go on and on.  Truly, there is no other RE like him.  Dr. Wang worked so hard with us for over a year, to bring us our son.   He is the kindest, smartest, most caring doctor.  He is considerate and brilliant and always a step ahead managing any road blocks.  He always went above and beyond to look out for us and always treated us with such extraordinary care.   He found autoimmune issues no other doctor had found, and that made all the difference for us.  I will always look back at our treatments with Dr.Wang with incredible gratitude.  Dr. Dicken was the third doctor I met with and for whatever reason I knew she would be the doctor that would finally make us parents. I have a sexual assault history and I felt comfortable disclosing this information to her. Before we completed the egg retrieval my anxiety was sky high because I was going to be unconscious-this made me feel extremely vonerable. After discussing my history and anxiety, Dr. Dicken listened with an open mind and reassured me. After that I was mentally ready to finally move forward with IVF.  At the beginning, i thought she was great but as things progressed she didnt seem sound on her own opinon and would change it, eg. when to trigger me etc. she often changed her mind at the last min (eg, 3 day transfer v 5 day). On the last attempt she did not clearly explain why the volume of eggs was so low.He is the most compassionate man who saw me as an individual. He took his time to answer all of my questions. He listened to all of my concerned and addressed each one making me feel at ease and heard. He believed in my intuition. He is amazing! He is amazing.  Best doctor ever.  Smart, compassionate and caring.  We have been in touch for years.  I moved to another doctor in the clinic for my FET 2.5 years after my fresh cycle with Jeff produced my daughter (for logistical reasons) and he kept in touch throughout my treatment and subsequent pregnancy with my twins even though i was no longer officially his patient.My wife and I had an amazing experience with Dr. T.  We had a bit of a difficult time getting pregnant and currently we are celebrating nearly a week with our healthy beautiful baby girl.  Throughout the process Dr. T was patient and understanding, always available to answer our questions.  He had a steady optimism that even in the worst of times during our process, let us knew one way or another things would work out.  It took a while and there were some struggles, but having him by our side throughout the process made things much easier.  We recommend Dr. T highly without any reservationsStrengths were being there to answer questions and offering support. 
He is good at communicating and educating his patients.  He could of talked more on the phone instead of emailing. Felt like he let me have too much control over my cycle and treatment plan which can be bad and good
I knew I needed a doctor who would give me the personal care I need in this difficult process and Dr. Wang def. exceeded my expectation. If I could, I'd have Dr. Wang as my doctor for everything. He's amazing!I highly recommend Cary Dicken to anyone who is exploring fertility treatment.  I plan on going back to her again soon.  She is one of the best doctors I have ever been to.  She is kind, caring and sympathetic.  Dr. T was very attentive the first time around. I’ll never forget the time we went for our 8week check up and found out our baby had no heart beat. My screams consumed the room and Dr. T got very emotional. He cried with my husband and I.Dr. Tortoriello was my third fertility doctor. I went through many IUIs and 2 IVF cycles elsewhere at a large factory clinic in NYC. By far my experience with Dr. T was the best. He knew me. He saw me for all my visits. He is very straightforward, patient, and kind. Plus he is technically great.  His sonograms and procedures never hurt me...he is very gentle.She is excellent in explaining options based on her assessment of your situation. She was realistic but hopeful. She said to me, ""if you were my sister, I would tell you not to give up on your own eggs."" and it almost made me cry because it felt so good to hear. Thanks to Dr. T, I have 2 beautiful children. I did 2 cycles with him, and each resulted in a singleton birth. I can't thank Dr. T enough for the joy of having full family.  He explained all treatments, checked in on how I felt, followed up on any emails and phone calls, was realistic in setting expectations, was compassionate and guiding every step of the way.  Cary was very candid and paid extreme attention to detail. I connected with her from the very first day. She took her time to review all my test results and explained clearly the best course of treatment. She insisted that I see other specialist in relation to other health issues I had and intact communicated with those specialist. She made sure :that health wise, I was ready to Cary a pregnancy
Dr. T. was very good at communicating, he replied very thoroughly / promptly to my questions.  I think there was probably  unnecessary part of the treatment and testing (immunology, hgh), i was stunned to have just one embryo after 2 months of prepping, and better results with other doctors.Dr. T is great! He was a little matter-of-fact about some things, when I could have used some reassurance at times, so that is probably my one complaint. But he is gentle, and I always trusted him. He did a great job and has a gentle touch. I explained this in my last post - but Dr. T is kind, patient and hopeful.  He is easy to talk to and knows his stuff.  He also is able to think ""outside the box"" and change up a cycle when needed.  He is a rockstar RE!Dr. Oehninger has always been open, realistic and communicative with my husband and I. I appreciate his expertise in the field and I trust his recommendations.  He has a very gentle approach when performing both IUIs.Sergio is a doctor that knows the science behind everything and had studied fertility for a long time. He is friendly and approachable but he spends little time with his patients on a one on one basis. Perhaps he is busy or he could also just be awkward at times.Well manared, soft spoken, always available thru email, gave my opinion priority even if he felt different, never pushed any procedure to me, well explained, it was easy to get his appointment, spoke with empathy, Dr. Wang is outstanding. He communicates extensively with me, gives thoughtful opinions and advice, and doesn't put me through anything hard unnecessarily. He truly considers me as a specific patient and doesn't automatically do or not do anything. He is clearly an expert, and has recommended things that have brought us increased success. I really like Dr Wang.  I eventually learned from going to another Dr at another clinic that there were several tests he did not even mention that I wished were done, that i didn't even know about until I saw another Dr.  It's possible we would have gotten there eventually, but I feel a little disappointed in how we started off because of that.  Feels like lost time, and I didnt feel like i was well informedExtremely patient.  Answered all my emails very quickly.  Very kind. Understanding.  Never makes you feel like a number and remembers the details of your situation.  He doesn't push any treatments but always gave options and let me decide.  He is an excellent communicator! He gave me his email address and answered every and any question I had within the hour. He treated me with respect, kindness and compassion. I never felt like I was taking up his valuable time like at my previous clinic. He should teach other doctors how to interact and treat patients--that's how greathe is. Dr. Dicken is smart, caring, compassionate. She understood the emotional implications that go along with treatment. She was always available and responded quickly to my emails. Can't recommend her more highly!!She was very knowledgable and thorough. Also seemed to enjoy her job. My husband and I actually discussed it and felt like she was somewhat like an aunt in nature- providing compassion, yet with direct facts.She was very helpful at explaining things and putting us at ease. The difference in results was day and night - and that had to do with her having a great bedside manner and listening to my worries and reservations.We could not be happier with our experience. He tempered our expectations to be realistic, while ensuring we never lost hope. He treated all of our questions respectfully and never spoke down to us while explaining out care plan.  Consult with him we knew right away that he was the doctor that we want to go it was extremely thorough but the same time very warm and kind   And every appointment I always saw him. I was never put with another doctor.  Cary is warm, smart, and professional. She has a friendly demeanor but still feels like your doctor.  The office is clean and bright, with tea in the waiting room –  does not feel dreary like a hospital. He was very even keel.  I had a huge set back and he just sent me an email delivering the news.  I was offended by this. He then was rushing me to try again right away and I wasn't ready.  I decided it was best to go somewhere else. I also was told I could have later appts.  That was not the case when I was cycling. I thought that he treated my case like no big deal.  He said he sees a ton of patients with DOR and recommended banking embryos.  He also suggested that I could just do a regular cycle but it seemed like he highly recommended the banking.Dr. Wang was the kindest, most compassionate doctor I've ever been to. He was realistic without being negative. He actually made me feel as if he appreciated me as a patient and as a person; Dr. Wang almost made going through IVF pleasant! He is simply the best doctor I have experienced during my journey. My husband shares the same feeling. I remember my husband telling me: 'this doctor did it right this time!'. He really did, we got a gorgeous baby boy.
I went to Cornell at first, thinking I would find the best doctors there but I was wrong, I had a horrible experience. 
Dr. Tortoriello understood my particular situation, took care of the medication management, oversaw the all process until the transfer of the embryo which he did personally and it was just flawless. He just knew the exact spot where to go place the embryo. While other doctors before just pushed the embryo in, I had the feeling that Dr. Tortoriello just knew the best spot for it.
I would recommend anybody who is having a hard time getting pregnant to go see Dr. Tortoriello, he might hold the solution to your problems.
Dr T always listens to patient suggestion if needed. During my IVF treatment i suggested some tweaks in protocol which he listened. When i came to this doctor it was my 3rd IVF which no positive hopes. But with this treatment i got my first positive test ever resulting in beautiful adorable daughter that i have now. without him it would never be possible for me to experience motherhood. Am forever thankful to Dr T and would recommend to any couple experiencing multiple failure. Dr T will do wonders in your life :)I went to Dr. O and SIRM after having 3 retrievals and 5 failed embryo transfers at Cornell.  My last two transfers were FET with PGS normal embryos which failed.  My RE at Cornell (Samantha Pfeifer) did not believe in testing for Natural Killer Cells, immunological issues or other ""out of the box issues"" so I sought another opinion.   During my consultation with Dr. O  he explained what tests he recommended and why, and what the course of action would be.  I did a multititude of tests that Cornell did not check for: bloodwork including NKa testing, an endometrial biopsy to test for inflammation (endometritis) and the Receptiva test to test for endometriosis.   My husband also did a sperm analysis and DNA fragmentation test. (Cornell also did not recommend the DNA fragmentation test.)   All results were normal except I had elevated NKa (25% vs the normal level of 10%).  The treatment for this will involve presnidone and possibly intalipid therapy.  I can’t say enough great things about Dr. Tortoriello.  My husband and I will be forever grateful.  His attentiveness,  caring demeanor, guidance and knowledge made me feel at ease the entire process.I have diagnosed with Asherman syndrome after I lost my identical twin girls. Many Dr had told me that I probably have to do gestation as my uterus was not able to develop any lining. However, Dr.T said to me that I should not give up, and he was right. I was able to get pregnant with the first cycle. After I delivered a healthy baby girl, I started another IVF cycle to have a second baby. I had two IVF cycles to retrieve enough eggs, and I transferred two eggs at a time twice. With the second time, I was able to get pregnant again. Now, I have two beautiful girls with me. I can only thank him. He was very kind and had a passion for helping women like me. Do not give up to have a baby until you see him!!I was at RMA previously, and I chose to leave because they didn’t create a custom plan and I felt like a number. Dr. Tortoriello and his team knew my name every visit, studied my tests comprehensively and created a plan that fit my situation (low ovarian reserve). Also, the financial process and calendaring of meds, injections and appointments was handled super clearly by Lindsay on Dr.T’s team. Fir the first time in the process, I felt in confident hands.Trustworthy and knowledgeable. I saw her at every appointment. Very communicative and able to be reached directly via email. Only negative I can think of is the appointments are short / can sometimes feel slightly rushed. Dr. T is the most honest fertility doctor I dealt with. I was a confusing case and he worked his hardest to find a way for me to become pregnant. He did not beat around the bush and was always up front about his thoughts and plans. He has a very dry sense of humor that I loved every time I saw him. He talked me like a peer not a patient. He knew how informed was about situation and never talked down to me. We always had collaborative conversations about my situation. Dr.T was excellent. He took his time to explain everything to us and was kind and compassionate throughout the entire experience. We felt like we were in good hands and working with someone who understood how difficult our journey had been.Dr. Dicken is well informed, compassionate and kind. She’s a seasoned professional and practitioner. Still, there were times when she was not as clear as she could have been due to fatigue. It is my impression that the work/life balancing act was at times overwhelming. This at times led to inconsistent statements and instructions. He is a great person and doctor. He is very compassionate and explains everything so you understand. He had great bedside manners and gives you all options. He tells you his honest opinion and works hard to make your dreams come true. I owe him a lot for helping me and my husband have the family we always dreamed of! I would recommend anyone struggling to have a baby to Dr. Tortoriello. I was advanced maternal age, had diminished ovarian reserve, and male factor issues. He recommended we try IVF and I became pregnant after the first round. Everyone in the Manhattan office from office staff to nurses were so kind. This is by not means an easy process to endure. I now have beautiful 7 year old boy thanks to Dr. T and his staff at Sher. I am forever grateful and blessed. Dr Browne is an amazing dr she’s so knowledgeable, sweet, caring , understanding, treats you like a friend and makes sure you know every detail there is to know , I’ve never been to such an amazing dr as she is . I had a long infertility journey and just wish I found Dr Tortoriello and his colleagues sooner. His clinic is not a factory like many of the other academic centers in NYC. The doctor will see you at every appointment, the doctor explains things to you, and the doctor KNOWS your history. The doctors here are also better than most academic centers in that they have the best training but also consider every aspect of infertility before putting you through more cycles (egg quality, immune therapy, implantation failure etc).  Too many places in NYC blow off patients with autoimmunity or implantation failures but Dr Tortoriello (and his colleagues) will be able to manage it and bring success if you stick with it!!!! I’m so thankful for their help in creating my family.He always answered all my questions completely and with compassion. He answered all e-mails in detail and promptly. He was always on time for his appointments and took time with me to make sure I understood everything going on. He gave me honest opinions while being optimist as possible. During my initial consult, he reviewed my file in advance of the meeting and was able to discuss potential future options.After numerous setbacks in previous cycles, we were desperate to find a doctor who could identify our own issues and adjust treatment methods accordingly. We have been fortunate that we met Dr. T and cannot thank enough what he did to us. Dr. T is kind and compassionate and has the ability and experience to adjust his treatment methods according to various situations of his patients. Drew Tortoriello is a great doctor who takes huge cafe of his patients. He really does never stop trying until you achieve your desired result but at the same time is not too invasive and tries to give you only medication you really need which I really appreciated. The fact that he is so responsive with questions by email was also extremely valuable to me. I can only think of one thing to improve and that would be informing patients about symptoms or consequences that certain medications can have. Overall he is fantastic and would recommend him to everyone struggling with fertility.Excellent doctor who listens to the needs of the patient.  Great bedside manner and optomistic.  I Highly recommend Dr. T.  I had a bad experience with another fertility doctor and Dr. T was the complete opposite.  Dr T’s responsiveness to my questions put me at ease. I never felt like I was going through this process alone. Even after I “graduated” from his care and transitioned to a routine OB, Dr T still answered any outstanding questions I had in a very quick and direct manner. Was sure to explain every step of each process and always answered any questions. Very knowledgeable in his field. Never misleading. Explained things we had no idea about. As to why pcos causes infertility. Helpful throughout the whole process especially when we ran into issues with our insurance and med coverageShe was kind, compassionate and knowledgeable. She even caught complications two other doctors I consulted with missed. She always took her time with me and fully explained everything. She’s the best and I will use her again. My experience over the past 2 years was wonderful all the way through.  After 3 failed IUI treatments, we were ready to proceed into IVF.  Dr T was there for us every step of the way.  We valued his opinion 100 % and he always made us feel like we were all in this together.  After 1 cycle of IVF, I am now in week 13 of my first pregnancy :) baby is strong and healthy, thanks Dr T!!!Dr. Tortoriello was kind and friendly and had a good sense of humor, but also very practical and straightforward when it came to discussing the details of my treatment with me. He listened to me and was never patronizing, and he wasn't afraid to admit it if he didn't have an immediate or good answer for something. I always appreciated the fact that he never discouraged me from researching or things on my own and asking questions--and was never dismissive when I did--because quite frankly, I couldn't have gone or stayed with any doctor with whom that wasn't the case. He also had a gentle hand with both ultrasound and retrievals (and was awake for all of the latter)... when you have as many as I did, that's really important! Overall, I would recommend him highly.Dr T. is very good at communicating, though his nurse was not.She scheduled an appointment just to speak with us and explain what may have happened when we received a negative pregnancy test after our first transfer. She was also very personable.Dr. O is kind but direct and responds to emails via their secure system quickly.I can’t say enough great things about Dr. Tortoriello and his wonderful staff.  After having a bad experience at a different clinic-we were referred to Dr Tortoriello by a close family member.  All I have to say is My husband and I will be forever grateful to Dr. Tortoriello.  His attentiveness,  caring demeanor, guidance and knowledge made me feel at ease the entire process.  His staff are always kind and smiling.  His nurse Cecilia is wonderful.  You can tell they work very hard to treat all patients with high level of care.  Most importantly I’m here holding my 2 month old beautiful baby girl thanks to Dr. Tortoriello!  He will be forever in my heart.  Dr. T was always positive, calm, respectful, and honest. Dr. Dicken is excellent at maintaining active correspondence during treatment. She always responded to our emails, which were often sent during periods of heightened emotion and anxiety, within 24 hours, and was both reassuring and realistic. She always read our chart before seeing us, and asked us how we were before delivering news.I switched to Dr Dicken after a failed IVF cycle at another clinic and the difference is night and day. Dr Dicken is compassionate yet straightforward, always reachable, did 99% of my scans. She gave me information but also provided advice. She has customized my treatment and allowed for flexible timing depending on the likelihood of success at each baseline.I have received extremely prompt contact from my assigned nurse with very detailed instructions/suggestions over email.  When we received our results for blood tests/semen analysis I received a call from both my nurse and a follow up with Dr. T to confirm my understanding.  My nurse (Cecelia) was thorough, but Dr. T was very comforting and understanding in the plan that we were hoping to move forward with.  He understood my concerns and helped me set in place our path.Dr. Tortoriello was always available by email and his office was as well (by email and by telephone).  He was sensitive to what I was experiencing emotionally and was encouraging.The office staff and Dr. T were always very responsive via email and in person and I never felt like a number. I felt unique in my journey and it was there approach that made me feel this way.  They are amazing. He was always nice and kind and polite. I always met with him every visit except for one weekend monitoring appointment where I met with his partner. He always answered my emails and all my questions. Everyone at Sher is so warm, they genuinely want to help you. Dr T. Is sensitive but also direct and tells you what to expect and doesn’t give you false hope. He also tries things when other Dr.s give up on you. I went to Dicken after Wang left the Sher Institute. Nobody will ever be Wang, but Dicken is a good substitute! She did a very thorough phone consultation for us before cycling again, obviously reviewed our extensive records, and has been extremely responsive while cycling. It was a combination of Dr. Tortoriello's bedside manner and the fact that Sher Institute's process is personable and didn't have the feel of an assembly line.I felt that this clinic treated me very well.  Everyone was always kind as Dr. Dicken was very compassionateDr T.  is very responsive to emails, typically responding within 2 hours. Unfortunately, because I wasn’t a local patient and did remote monitoring (through another clinic), I didn’t get to have the regular/ frequent interaction with him during monitoring or speak with him about my results. If you do remote monitoring like I did, I would recommend arranging follow-up phone consultations after each monitoring. I found his emails too brief so I always had follow-up questions. 

All in all, I would have appreciated more communication and personal guidance.Dr. Dicken and nurses and staff at the clinic were all kind and responsive in communicating. The moment my husband and I met Dr. Wang we felt a breath of fresh air. Coming off a very bad experience with a different doctor at a different clinic, we felt we were given no other options but donor eggs, after only one IVF cycle. On the contrary, Dr. Wang sat with us and answered ALL of our questions. Not once did we feel rushed.  He made us feel like all of our questions were important questions. He also suggested supplements that he felt might help us and told us not to hesitate to contact him via email. I already felt like I was in good hands even though we hadn't even started our cycle yet. Whenever I emailed Dr. Wang he was always quick to write a response. It felt good that Dr. Wang actually cared. Dr Wang gives very personalized care. And you can actually communicate with him directly. He takes the time to explain what he recommends and you never feel like he is just throwing out a cookie-cutter protocol. His bedside care is amazing. He is warm, open, and caring. He listens and is incredibly patient. He remembers my case and responds to every email! Dr. Tortoriello is a very calm and reassuring physician. He presented information  without editorializing or imposing any judgement. I've never met a doctor quite like Jeff before. Jeff really makes me feel like part of the team that is treating our infertility and not just a number in a paper gown. In spite of still not being successful, I have nothing but good things to say about Dr. Wang. He is responsive, compassionate, thoughtful. He responds to emails on nights, weekends, all the time really, with thorough responses. He always asks what you think, too. Doesn't just give his opinion. He's open to your thoughts and feedback but is also authoritative when you need him to be. He manages all your monitoring appointments. His bedside manner is great. It feels like he is really invested in your success. Dr. Tortoriello was always available to speak with me whether over the phone , in person or via email.  He always took his time to explain all of my options and any answered any concerns or questions I had during my process.  Loved his one-on-one communication.  She a d her staff were just really cool and personable. They remember you and your case and everyone was positive and encouraging.I saw Dr. Tortoriello for every visit. He did each and every ultrasound and at the end of each scan he told me exactly where he thought i was in the process in relation to  where he thought I ought to be.  He did both my egg harvest and embryo implantation. He responded to all my many emails, even during his Easter weekend.Dr. Dicken was a kind and understanding doctor, who did not hesitate to give us the information we needed but was sensitive and considerate when she had bad news to deliver. She remembered us, kept in touch and was always available when we needed her. In contrast to other doctors we saw, Dr. Dicken was as kind and warm as she was totally professional. That made a great difference to us as we were going through a stressful process.Dr T was very kind every time I went to see him. Very soft spoken and made me feel very comfortable Although Doctor Wang didn't have a lot of time the time that he did spend was meaningful.  He always made me feel important and most of all he was extremely responsive via email.  I've emailed other doctors and till this day some of them have yet to respond.  Doctor Wang is an amazing doctor the most compassionate doctor  I have ever met.  In addition, he's extremely smart and thinks outside the box.  Dr. Wang was very warm from the beginning. I had a difficult diagnosis and he remained realistic but positive. With Sher, you see you doctor with every monitoring appointment so it was great to have so much face time with Dr. Wang. Even when we received disappointing news, it felt like he was right there with you. I researched everything so always had a lot of questions. Dr. Wang would email back quickly and took the time to explain everything. Dr. Wang may be the most compassionate doctor I have ever been treated by.  He makes himself readily available and has always returned my emails the same day, whether I reached out in the morning, afternoon, or late evening. He is always the one to see me for all my appointments and spends the time afterwards to discuss with me any issues or questions that may have arisen. At Sher you only ever see YOUR doctor and you always have an appointment.  There are no ""cattle calls"" or long waits. Your doctor knows you, they work with you every day. Dr. O replied to emails quickly, never pressured us to try something we weren't comfortable with, and was a great combination of compassionate and professional. She treated us like an individual couple and prescribed a treatment plan specifically for us (unlike at another clinic where we felt like they had one thing they ""do"" and you were doing that thing that way regardless). My treatment was highly individualized, and my care was very hands-on. Dr. Dicken makes recommendations based on medical needs but takes your preferences and resources into consideration as well. Somehow, she managed to recite almost all my numerous test results and numbers off the top of her head during appointments. She always mentioned treatment costs upfront as well as potential savings. Since I prefer less medication, Dr. Dicken always explained why she recommends a new medication or increase in dosage. I appreciated that I was informed and involved in my healthcare decisions.Dr Wang is amazing and treats everyone with care and compassion.  He spends so much time and energy on every patient.  He sets such a high standard for all doctors to followDr Wang treats you like a human more than any doc I have ever experienced (and I have known a lot). He is honest but optimistic and understands the emotional side -- example, night before retrieval I freaked out when I had night sweats and worried my estrogen was dropping and I had ovulated. I emailed him at 2am!! HE emailed at like 5:30am saying it's probably fine but he gets I'm worried and we did a quick ultrasound before retrieval to be sure I hadn't ovulated (I had not) Dr. Dicken was responsive, attentive, patient and very accessible by phone, email or in person. She made me feel like I was her only patient.Dr. Wang is the most caring, engaged, and dedicated doctor i have visited in 15 years of living in NYC.  He takes as much time as needed to explain everything that is going on in your body (helpful for us non-medical professionals) and gives his candid evaluation in a straightforward but kind and patient way.  His receptionists knew me by my first name, and his office is absolutely not a factory.    He also is completely available and responsive by email, even once when he was on vacation and I called with a minor question that I thought another doctor would answer, he sent me an email.From the onset, Dr Dicken asked what our long term goals were and what we were willing to do to achieve them. She remembers practically every detail we've shared with her about issues ranging from our preference for non-medicated cycles to why we have a timing preference for our most recent planned transfer. She demonstrates empathy and always shares her professional opinion directly, kindly and without judgement. Dr. Dicken informed us that we could have local monitoring (in conjunction with care at Sher) since we live in another state.  However, neither the Sher medical team nor my local clinic techs communicated with one another throughout day 5 of my monitoring cycle. I had to call Sher several times to ensure the ultrasound and blood test results were received and read by my RE.  In addition, when we arrived at Sher NYC for day 8 monitoring apt, Dr. Dicken said that she only saw 3 large follicles.  She said that had been given more information by the local clinic (i.e. follicle sizes measuring under 10mm) then she would have known my follicles were not properly aligned and would have suggested I be placed on a full week of estrogen priming prior to the cycle.  However, Dr. Dicken and her team failed to communicate this information to me or to my local clinic during the first 7 days of my cycle.  As a result, I nearly cancelled this retrieval. 

Neither Dr. Dicken nor her team communicated with me or my partner for 8 days while we waited for the embryology report.  An IVF clinic will typically provide you information about embryo growth at days 2, 3, 5, and 6. Not the case here.  On the morning of day 8 she called me to tell me all embryos had suddenly arrested on day 3.  However, she said she was not sure she could provide me or my partner with an embryology report because she wasn't sure the embryologist had even taken notes on day 3!  

It is important to note that I froze my eggs with Dr. Dicken two years ago. I had great results---18 eggs retrieved and 14 eggs frozen.  I also had 6 eggs frozen from another clinic.  We attempted to thaw and fertilize these 20 eggs along with the fresh cycle.  I received a call from Dr. Dicken letting me know that only 25 percent of my eggs had properly thawed!  She said she didn't know why---possible poor lab conditions (and 14 of my eggs were vitrified at Sher) or poor egg quality.  Again, she couldn't give me a clear answer.  
Dr. Wang always took time to explain his thoughts and to answer any questions thoroughly.  He never rushed me and never left me wondering what he meant or what the plan was.   He also has an incredibly thoughtful personality and I truly felt like he was seriously invested in getting us pregnant and taking home a baby.   He also remembered little bits about me that weren't pertinent to our fertility, which also made me feel like a real person and not just another patient.   I also know for fact that his other patients also feel the same way as I've talked with several of them. 
The doctor communicates quickly by email -like within the half hour- to answer any questions.  The support staff also responds quickly and with empathy.Sher is a much smaller clinic. I had previously been at RMA and was very happy with the level of engagement you get with only your doctor. Dr. O'Shaughnessy is very real, upfront, and while not warm and fuzzy, she is responsive, and knows you and your issues and the plan. Dr. Wang is the best doctor I've ever had. Beginning with our consult, he welcomed us recording the session. He gave us some great advise and came up with a game plan right then. He never and still has never uttered the words ""donor egg"", even with now 5 IVF failures. We left there and he wrote down his personal email address to write him with any questions. Over the next month and a half, even while getting treatment elsewhere, we were in constant email communication with him and he provided guidance every step of the way. He always responds quickly and never makes me feel like any question is crazy or stupid. He has looked for, tested, and found issues that no other doctor thought to check before.  I live 7 hours away and he is worth every second of the drive to see him. With my other doctors, I was stressed and frustrated because I never thought they listened or cared. Jeff is a true one in a million, and I will be eternally grateful for having found him.Dr. Wang is an exceptional doctor.  He genuinely cares for his patients and responds thoroughly to every question (not matter how seemingly insignificant) with care and concern.  He takes his time to understand your case and never forgets a detail about you.  It's a small clinic - only 4 total doctors. And I see Dr. Dicken for EVERY SINGLE THING - meetings, follow-ups, consultations, every single morning monitoring, egg retrieval, etc. If I ever have any questions - big or little - I email her and she responds directly to me within 24 hours. It's been amazing. Such great, personal care. Dr. Dicken was consistently warm and friendly, while still being honest and frank about our chances. She remembered me and the details our my history from appointment to appointment and answered emails quickly. Dr. Tortoriello is very patient and is truly your doctor. He spent about 70 minutes with me at our first visit and he went over all the options and treatments. I asked him about PDG testing and he said it was an option but for me with such low egg number it might be best to just implant any healthy looking day 5 embryo. He really listened and he also did all my procedures...all of them. He also is great with emails.After the first couple visits, everyone knew my name and the desk staff knew me on sight. Unlike the first clinic I went to, there were never more than one or two other women waiting at any given time. The staff also seemed relaxed.At first, everything was perfect.  The structure of visits was totally different than the factories I was used to going to.  Unfortunately, it ended up being like most places I have been to.  Impersonal and another number.  from the moment I walked in to Dr.Dickens office I was treated with such kindness. She was direct, but had a nice way of speaking to me. I left her office hopeful. The practice seemed small and more intimate.  You would see maybe 2 or 3 patients in the waiting room.  At another practice I had been to there were more than 50 patients in the waiting room each time I went, a different doctor would see me every time and had no clue what my history was. Dr. T always met with me for a discussion whenever I requested, always responded to my emails within an hour and most importantly remembered who I was when I came into his office.Dr. Dicken has wonderful bedside manners. She answered all our questions in great detail. She even replied fast to emails. She was very honest in predicting our chances and I had the impression she tried everything to enhance our chances to get pregnant. She even gave us some extra medication for free when ours ran out and she felt like I need another injection before egg retrieval. She always made me feel welcome, understood and secure. I loved having her as my doctor in this critical, emotional challenging time. From our first consultation, Dr. Dicken really made an effort to get to know us.  She was always available to answer any questions over email, and her tone was always warm and professional.  Even when she had bad news to deliver, Dr. Dicken was straightforward but still encouraging.  Believing that she really cares for her patients helped me remain optimistic throughout the process.Monitoring was made by individual appointments rather than a giant cattle call. In addition, I was able to personally communicate with my doctor through email whenever I needed. Dr. Dicken took the time to discuss the issues we were having with recurrent miscarriages thoroughly with both me and my husband. She was kind and warm, but also gave us space to make decisions on our own. She really seems to understand how to support her patients while still giving them the space to deal with an intensely private matter.Dr. Wang's personable bedside manner always made me feel like I was being treated like a real human.  He is caring and compassionate.  He always remembered the details of my case and I never felt like ""just a chart"".Dr. O was always direct, yet empathetic in explaining any results. She conveys a familial-like vibe - sort of like your favorite Aunt. She remained positive despite my first negative pregnancy test, and was encouraging in our next cycle.Dr.Wang is so down to earth. He gives you real expectations, but with a smile and a sincere wish to help you achieve your dream of being a parent. Many Drs, especially REs, get stuck in Doctor mode. They don't take the time to exchange a real human interaction with their patients. They wear their lab coats and talk about your fertility as if there were talking about changing the carborator on your car. For me, as I imagine for many women, it's very traumatic not being able to conceive, on so many levels. Very soon after I got a BFN with Dr. Wang- he not only called me personally, but he sent an email- empathizing with our loss, and giving us some hope for next cycle. It was the most sincere letter I had ever gotten from anyone in the healthcare business- and after that loss, it ever so slightly took some of the bitterness out of our loss. 
I imagine this has to be one of the hardest professions to be in as you are dealing with very challenging odds, and many setbacks.  Dr.Wang doesnt only do his job with excellent technical skills, but professionalism, integrity and compassion. These qualities set him apart, because it is not just his medical skills that make him a great doctor, it's just who he is.Dr. Dicken had the patience to answer my MILLION questions and gave me honest reassurance when I felt overwhelmed and afraid.Dr. Dicken is in a league of her own.  Her attitude and knowledge made for an excellent IVF experience.  My wife and I were not only blessed with a positive outcome, but also felt totally cared for along the way.  After quite a bit of fertility research, we had an initial meeting with Dr. Dicken to discuss our options.  We quickly knew she was the best doctor and Sher the right practice to help us expand our family.  The IVF process can seem quite overwhelming.  Dr. Dicken and the wonderful staff at Sher made sure we had all appointments, calendars, RX’s, and most importantly knowledge along the way.  The office is run like a well-oiled machine- rarely a wait, efficient and caring nurses, insurance know-how, and all services onsite.  Another couple friend worked with Dr. Dicken/Sher as well; they had the same excellent results and glowing feedback.  We enthusiastically recommend Dr. Dicken and Sher to anyone in need of their expertise.  All the nurses know me and my case by name. Dr Dicken has a wonderful bed side manner and is very responsive to questions. She is very compassionate.The care was very personal, and the clinic was very careful.
It did feel however that some of the tests were done as a matter of practice, and upon their receipt there was no diagnosis provided. Ultimately, I never understood the true value of the results of the test - Endometrial function test and NK cell test.
I was an out of state patient and it was difficult to ask questions and receive answers.  When we did travel to NY, Dr Dicken kept us waiting for hours and was very cold, unreceptive to questions.  I felt like patient 1234 versus having the individualized care I've received with other doctors.""The best ever RE you can find on the East Coast! Not only in the state of NY, but for the entire East Coast! After being a patient to many other REs, once I met Dr. Wang, I knew he was the RE I needed! We have our miracle son due to his fantastic work, incredible bedside manners, extreme knowledge of protocols and customizing treatments for his patient’s needs. Can’t say enough great things about Dr. Wang and his team! Extraordinary person with charismatic personality and fantastic mind! THANK YOU DR. Wang for making it happen for us after 8 years wait! WE LOVE YOU!!! Forever grateful!”Dr. Dicken is warm and personable. She is very responsive to email and genuinely cares about her patients and their results. I felt comfortable asking her any questions I had and she was always patient and thoughtful when answering. I never felt rushed out of her office and felt well taken care of by her. I was a satellite Patient. I do think if I was in NY for my whole treatment, I would give Dr. O'Shaughnessy a better result, but I felt like In the beginning stages she wasn't totally on top of my results. Once we got to the retrieval stage I felt more comfortable. That said, SHE did email me every time with my results or call, unlike bigger facilities. I felt like a human with this dr because I saw him every time I came into the clinic. He was super involved and I was able to email him anytime I wanted in which he would answer within a few hours. He was very caring and compassionate. I did not have success with him and he still emailed me to see how I am doing years later. I sometimes email him with ideas that my new drs have and he always gives me his advice. He has the best bedside manner of any doctor.  I've never felt like someone cared as much about us or fought as hard for us.  He kept us informed and gave us a voice.  Infertility sucks, but he, and the baby he and his team are responsible for creating, were the good things to come out of the process.He would answer all questions calmly and completely in person, on the phone, by email and on the webboardGreat explanations of questions. At the same time, doesn't linger on the negative, looks to see what results are and changes tactics if needed. Seems to have good communication with his nursing staff. I had a concern about hyper stimulation and about insemminating too many and both were address thoughtfully and realistically. He might not appear warm and fuzzy but is a very caring, smart doctor. Not for those looking to be babied or looking to get the doctor to do whatever they want. This is a medical treatment with great risks and he is a person of integrity.I felt that Dr. T knew who I was as a patient - he was prepared to discuss my case every time and was very accessible.He couldn't remember my information, like I was remote monitoring. Seems pretty obvious since I told him at the consultation & all my forms had my out of state address on it.A number is faceless, a human (especially, a patient) requires compassion, attention to details, understanding, and I dare say empathy. Dr. Tortoriello treated my wife and I as if we were the only patients that mattered.Dr Dicken emails with me personally, takes my ideas seriously, and based my treatment on what was going on with my body, not just standard clinic protocol. I felt like she is really invested in coming up with something that will work for me. Dr. Wang was very accessible to answer all my questions. I could call him as well as email him with any updates or questions and he responded right away, most of the time within an hour or two. I always personally saw Dr. Thornton or a trusted colleauge at each of my appointments. If it was not going to be Dr. Thornton, he would let me know in advance.Dr. Dicken was empathetic and gentle in the way that she communicated with me during a very emotional IVF cycle.  When asked questions (in-person/via email) she was patient and responded in ""laymen"" terms. Where do I start with Dr. T...he is kind, compassionate, knowledgeable and extremely accessible. He would speak to us like we were family, not strangers at his practice. Dr. T would respond to my emails on weekends, nights, during his PTO. He truly wants what's best for his patients. Dr. Dicken is professional and friendly. I appreciate that she is available by email.Dr. Tortoriello was friendly and professional. He stated exactly what he found and diagnosed my condition immediately. He mentioned several options for my treatment and responded to all my emails. Dr. T talked with my on the phone to calm me down when I was very upset over my fibroid bleeding. He told me all would turn out well over time, and everything did.
I highly recommend Dr. Tortoriello for any and all fertility needs and female issues. He is kind, knowledgeable and treats you like a human being. Personalized care, short wait time, individual approach. Same doctors, same nurses, small practice, feels like home, not like factory.He spent over an hour at our first consult and he went over all my old records thoroughly and there was a lot!  He didn't discourage me even though I was told I was ""too old"" and had ""old eggs"" by other doctors so he gave me hope. He saw me for EVERY visit !! he did all his own sonograms and the retrieval and transfer.  This was night and day compared to my other centers where I saw my main doctor once or twice the whole time.Dr. Wang is the most compassionate and caring doctor that I have ever had. He provides a level of personalized care that is simply a cut above the rest.  I can't imagine ever feeling like I was just a number under his care.  His level of attentiveness and kindness is what one can only hope for with every doctor but yet is so hard to find.Dr. Wang is the warmest, most compassionate doctor I’ve ever had for any treatment.   She always listened to our questions and concerns. Even thought she was the doctor, she valued our opinion during our treatment. The office staff in Westchester are lovely. I had Dr. Browne's mobile number and was able to call her. She responded to all my emails. Dr.  Wang is the most compassionate doctor who I have ever had the pleasure to work with (you read that correctly, work with). He was available to answer any questions at any time of the day. He responded quickly with pure scientifical, yet empathetic answers during such an emotionally fueled time. I still email this amazing doctor to show him pictures of my beautiful 27 month old girls. His smile was such a comfort to me during the ivf cycle. I would recommend him to anyone who would listen. He sets the bar so high for all of my future drs.Dr Wang is the best doctor i have ever been to.  He listens, he gives amazing advice and he cares so much.Dr T has amazing bedside manner and explains all of your options to you.  He expresses a realistic optimism that as we were having trouble let us know everything was going to be okHe explained everything in great detail and he wrote back immediately.  He is excellent at explaining things and educating his patients.Dr. Wang seemed super knowledgeable from the first meeting we had. He was extremely approachable and he followed up after our first consultation the same night. His prompt responses made me feel like he really took the time to speak with his patients. I was extremely comfortable working with him. Much better than the experience I had working with a different doctor before!!!Cary Dicken is a wonderful doctor who really cares about her patients.  She answers her e-mails right away, makes time for each patient to ask questions or raise concerns both in person and over the phone.  She is calm, nurturing and honest.  The way she delivers information is with respect and care.  She has amazing communication skills.The first time was awesome. Dr. T went out of his way to accommodate us. He was very attentive to our needs. The second time around I felt we were rushed. It wasn’t the same energy.He is very warm and personable. He answered all of m,y very many emails promptly. He called me with results.Dr. Dicken is incredibly kind, compassionate and a good listener. She did not sugarcoat bad news but was very sensitive to the stress we were under and always gave me time to make decisions and listened to my concerns and questions. She always responded to my emails. Dr. T is a knowledgeable, patient, thorough doctor. He took time to explain our test results, chart the path to fertility, answer any questions and always respond to inquiries that came up during treatmentCary L Dicken was very thorough and gave me her time absolutely. She was very candid and ensured I was in best of health before starting the fertility treatment. It was obvious she was not: desperate to collect my money and commence treatment until she was sure that my body was ready to carry a pregnancy. She was very firm and I'm now grateful for it.
Sheri was a small facility. I never waited very long, and it always felt comfortable in the waiting room. Everyone was friendly and kind, and I always felt like I was in good hands. Dr. T was kind, patient and answered all of my questions.  My last clinic was more like a ""factory"" whereas Sher was more of a boutique where they knew who I was.  Dr. T manor is calm and he was also hopeful, which my last RE was not.  Before Dr. T, my MD told me I had ""less than 5%"" chance of ever getting pregnant with my own eggs.  I was devastated.  Dr. T turned that all around - in one IVF we had a great cycle and I now have him to thank for my 5 year old son.All of the staff were always pleasant and explained all procedures thoroughly.He was great and friendly but seemed very busy all the time.He was very soft spoken and treated with careHe has excellent bedside manner, allows me to be me while communicating with him, and solicits my own thoughts in how we approach my care and treatment. Very good manner and a great communicator.  I really felt like he caredAnswered questions with patience, never made me feel crazy or annoying He seemed genuinely concerned about me as a patient AND person. He took into account my schedule & work demands. He made himself available by email, text, phone. He is, BY FAR, the best Dr. I've ever had.Dr. Dicken is a warm, smart, caring doctor. She was always available to talk by email and wrote me personally to update me. I never felt like I was being treated at a factory. I felt cared for and important. It was a personal experience. Dr. Dicken was quick to communicate via email and always explained her decisions - even ones I wasn't happy with. She was open to my suggestions and really made it a team effort.Dr. Wang was available to us basically 24/day. If we emailed him a frantic question, he would always respond in an appropriate time. He took our fears to heart and would even step out of the exam room for a moment if we needed to cry and gather ourselves together. He  has the best bedside manner ever! He was always there for me whether it would be through via cell phone text or email. Any questions day or night he was there to answer my call.  He's always warm and kind we see him and always remember the last conversation you had with him. Pleasant, intelligent, answers all questions and emails.You can make an appt.  but one time I had to wait for over an hour in the exam room.  Very flat affect in general.  Dr. Wang was incredibly kind and his communication skills were excellent. He was always available by email and would respond quickly even on weekends and during odd hours.The doctor was compassionate and reassuring. I remember he was very calm during the procedure and inspired confidence. He made me feel like it was going to work.
He doesn't talk a lot but he gives you a great sense that he knows what he is doing.Dr T was so open minded and always cared and listened to me.  Dr.T always listen to me and answered any of my questions. The best thing was that I was able to email him for several questions, and he replied me very quickly. He cheered me up and told me that I did not have to give up having a baby(s). He was always kind and calm which I really liked.I interviewed several doctors before selecting Dr. Tortoriello. Of all the doctors I spoke to, he was the most patient, thoughtful and comforting. I found the IVF process can be very intimidating, but Dr. T was the perfect combination of positive and honest. I felt at ease. Dr. Dicken is approachable, direct and very up to date on recent developments in fertility technology. I had done a lot of research which she was very open to discussing. She’s also reachable via email and responds within 24 hours normally. He took time to review my situation and come up with personalized treatment. It was not cookie cutter. Dr. Tortoriello’s bedside manner was one of the things we appreciated most about him. He was understanding and kind throughout the entire process and made us feel like real people with someone in our corner.People always greeted us by name and knew the details of our case file. He took the time out to answer all my questions even by email. He has great bedside manners and easy to talk to about anything. Dr. Browne is amazing at what she does , she’s so friendly and knowledgeable Dr T had to give me bad news many times and he is gentle/kind but also honest/pragmatic and will get you through to the  best results that are possible for you.He remembered details about my fertility during our appointments and did not need to continue to refer to my chart. He spoke to me kindly and with compassion. He always made sure all of my questions were answered.He is very considerate and always asked how I was feeling every time I had treatment with him. Dr. T is truly a kind man who cares about his patients. Dr T  and his team would always answer all my questions via email or in person and treated me with a lot of care. Even when the autoimmune doctor recommended a protocol he thought was too strong for me, we would analyze it in detail and tailor it to my needs. During my consultation with Dr. Tortoriello, he took his time explaining to my husband and I what our options were.  He explained exactly how IVF works and what needs to be done leading up to the procedure.  He also suggested that we try IUI first before moving on to IVF since I had gotten pregnant the previous year by IUI.  He has a calm and charismatic misdemeanor and I truly appreciate that.Dr T was incredibly compassionate - and just the feel of his office was light years different from a prior fertility practice I was treated at. I never felt like “cattle” and always felt like a person. His quick responsiveness to all of my questions assured me during a very anxiety-ridden time.  Explained everything thoroughly and cared about what we were going through. Compassionate and caringDr Dicken never made me feel rushed and always took her time to explain everything to me. Dr. T always made us feel comfortable and well taken care of.  Always matter of fact and able to answer anything we sent his way.",9.0,8.300000000000008,"Dr. Dicken is a skilled doctor who is willing to treat patients with severely diminished ovarian reserve. I had previously been to another clinic where I felt like a number and that the clinic had decided I needed to undergo IVF before even diagnosing me or conducting any tests. I felt that he took my questions seriously and was patient driven. I wasn't sure if I would care one way or the other, since in the first clinic I went to, the monitoring was done by techs and I loved those ladies, in the end I think I felt more comfortable with Dr. T doing the monitoring simply because it meant that I saw him all the time and felt like I had many opportunities to ask any questions I may have had. I guess my doctor was busy with another procedure. During our consultations, he didn't sugar coat things and gives you the honest facts. But he wholeheartedly wants it to work for his patients without making promises. Our insurance doesn't cover IVf treatments, so unfortunately we were priced out of SIRM, but even now, I am not his patient yet he still responds and answers my questions, faster and with more definition then my current doctor. Dr. Dicken and the wonderful staff at Sher made sure we had all appointments, calendars, RX’s, and most importantly knowledge along the way. He has an extremely calm bedside manner and explained what we were trying to accomplish at the beginning of every appointment. For that, we are eternally gratefulHonestly, even if this doesn't work, I'm glad we tried our 2nd IVF with Dr. Dicken instead of staying at our old clinic. He was very realistic without dashing my dreams and prayers. He is good at communicating and educating his patients. He gave me honest opinions while being optimist as possible. Unfortunately, because I wasn’t a local patient and did remote monitoring (through another clinic), I didn’t get to have the regular/ frequent interaction with him during monitoring or speak with him about my results. I also know for fact that his other patients also feel the same way as I've talked with several of them. Dr. Tortoriello is very patient and is truly your doctor. She was direct, but had a nice way of speaking to me. He stated exactly what he found and diagnosed my condition immediately. Dr. T talked with my on the phone to calm me down when I was very upset over my fibroid bleeding. Wang is the most compassionate and caring doctor that I have ever had. Dr. Dicken was quick to communicate via email and always explained her decisions - even ones I wasn't happy with."
43,Sher Fertility of New York,advice,"Ask questions, and be sure that you understand every aspect of the proposed treatment as well as the rationale. Maintain communication throughout.Get educated, ask questions, be an active partner in your treatment.Ask as many questions as you need - he will take the time to answer them.Ask him any questions you have...he will answer them.Don’t ever give up and Trust Dr. T. And his approach. I feel he is not about the money.... but truly cares. I believe that he really is in this to help in this difficult journey of infertility. Just ask questions and ask the office staff questions as well to put your mind at rest and email him your concerns. I never had to long wait or really any wait at all at his office...it was well run. Go with Dr. T and Sher, they are kind and know what they are doing. Ask questions when you need to and know that Dr. T is usually right when he says things don’t look right.If you’re a former patient of Dr. Wang’s and you’re thinking about staying with SIRM, Dr. Dicken is a wonderful option. Be proactive about your case. This is true for any fertility doctor you visit. Tell her what you are thinking and she will work with you to do the best treatment for you.Be an educated patient. Ask questions. Schedule follow-up appointments. If you're not sure, ask and she'll tell you. If you have felt that all doctors have given up hope on you, please seek out Dr. Wang! Ask every question you have, no matter how silly you think it might be.  Dr Wang is a rare doctor that never makes you feel like any question is dumb, or that you are bothering him or insulting his role as a doctor.  You must  do your own research and be proactive! He is quiet and introverted ... Make sure you ask all your questions! He doesn't make promises, but he will take so much of the anxiety out of the process. If you need someone who is reassuring, honest, and thoughtful, Dr. T your best bet. He's so worth it. I don't even live in NY. He's that worth it. Meet him. Do the consultation. Ignore that Sher may have lower SART stats (and really not statistically significant) than other big NYC clinics. I would tell a prospective patient to pick him as your fertility doctor.  He takes his time with you and explains everything to you.   You will not be disappointed.Don’t be afraid to ask questions and trust her instincts. I was so annoyed she sent me for an MRI of my uterus... it turns out my earlier RE’s totally missed that I had a uterine septum! Her instincts were right!Consult with him early onward and then make your choice.The advice I would give is to see Dr. Dicken first before trying other facilities. Frankly, we wasted time and money with another doctor who was more of a big name but ended up a disappointment. Email is his best way of communication and it was mine too because of work. That was perfect. Every email I sent was replied to within minutes by either the doctor or the nurseBefore you do a transfer have doctor Wang do the tests like EFT especially if you've have prior failed transfers.  Don't be afraid to ask lots of questions via email, doctor Wang will always respond.  Don't be afraid to ask questions but trust in his answers.Run, don't walk to go see him!Speak up! Be your own advocate because she is more than happy to listen and follow your lead.Communicate openly and honestly with Dr. Dicken--she really listens and respects patient concerns, questions, and wishes. When she makes a recommendation or communicates test results (you'll never need to follow up to get test results on time!), she asks what questions you have rather than asking if you have any questions. I was open about some embarrassing things and never been met with judgement, which is very different from my experiences with other doctors. My results and overall experience were definitely been much better because of it.You will not regret going to Dr Wang - he is amazing!!Do not be afraid to ask him anything!!! he is very open minded Ask as many questions as you must and avail yourself of asking questions of her via email or her team.Run, don't walk, to an appointment with him.  You will not find someone more dedicated.I wish I switched to Dr. Dicken sooner. Do not hesitate. She is an all around rock star in all aspects of patient care.Her strengths: she will answer emails in a timely manner.  She seems like a nice person.

Her weaknesses: very poor verbal communication skills.  You may have to wait several days before receiving lab report.  Dr. Dicken will call you herself. You will have no communication with the embryologist.

No question is off limit with him.  He's open to everything and will give you feedback as to why or why not he thinks it's a good option. I wish I'd switched to him sooner, so I'd encourage everyone who is wondering if they should get a second opinion to go ahead and do it sooner than later.  Don't be afraid to ask lots of questions and explain your ideal outcome.  Initially he didnt recommend PGS testing but when we explained we wanted to bank frozen embryos he agreed PGS testing would be beneficial.  I'm glad we made that choice.Don't expect warm and fuzzy or humor. She's very pragmatic and straightforward. Be prepared to work with the best doctor in your life.If Dr. Wang is an option for your family, do not hesitate. Since she is so good at answering questions - bring ALL the questions you have! She will give you her honest, professional opinion. If you have a wild idea or heard of a new thing, mention it - she's open to talking about everything and seems to understand how hard and complex this is. She may stick to her professional assessment, but always worth mentioning anything and everything that crosses your mind. I'm not sure -- I really felt like I received good care. I was transferring embryos from another clinic and I wish I'd done a better job of keeping all the details of all of my testing clear, but that is more a statement about my own level of disorganization. Dr. Dicken was thorough and considered all the aspects of my history. Just listen to him, and don't be afraid to ask any questions because he is very happy to answer them all.I recommend Dr. T, and from limited interaction with the other two doctors, all of  the doctors at this clinic without reservation. They ALL come across as very serious and caring.Communication is key.  Ask questions and don't let yourself be treated like cattle. 
Being told that she would be unavailable would have allowed me to be informed and aware of the changes.  That is important to women dealing with infertility as we already have little control over most things.   No matter what you are thinking or feeling tell Dr. Dicken. She is understanding and kind. Dr. Dicken wants the same outcome as you and she truly cares. I think all patients of all doctors should always advocate for themselves. Come to the appointment as informed as possible, think about what questions you want to ask beforehand. Just rest assured hat you are in good hands with her and that she will do the best to get you pregnant.Don't be shy to ask questions! Dr. Dicken is great at breaking down complicated test results and procedures, and is always accessible over email.Do your research beforehand. He is very willing to try new things. Come prepared with as much information as you can - dates, cycle tracking, anecdotal evidence of how you have felt and reacted while trying to get pregnant or during other treatments. Dr. Dicken will gather as much information as possible and factor it into her recommendation. I was impressed that she looked at the length of my cycles, the timing of ovulation according to ovulation strips, the timing of my miscarriages, and noticed a pattern of Kate ovulation. I was glad I had tracked this information. She us extremely thorough.Make an appointment as soon as possible - don't delay.Trust her. It's an emotional process- but try not to be too emotional. See it as a goal to be met and take care of business. Follow her orders and pray for the best!Ask lots of questions- he will answer them all! And take his advice- he is so knowledgeable.Have your health records ready to go, like genetic and medical history.She is an excellent physician with a great staff.  Take notes during an initial appointment but know she is available to answer any questions as you go alongTRUST HIMAll the doctors at Sher are pretty good, but she has been our favourite. She is young enough to know all the new treatment and not be stuck in her ways, but also has a good amount of experience. Ask as many questions as possible and fully understand what you are actually being tested for - what the purpose is and how the results are being interpreted. Don't expect kindness or compassion.Never give up and trust Dr. Wang completely!Don't be afraid to reach out and ask her about concerns you have (I even sent her a picture of a bloody pad)!To make sure you are prepared with your questions during the monitoring phase. From my experience, I felt Dr O was not as attentive during this stage because its not as important to the dr. despite every day being important to the patient. My advice is that he is a really kind and caring doctor. He is on top of it all and will deliver news to you personally. You will have a human experience here.Run, don't walk, to see him.He is a great doctor. Though I think I will take statistics advice elsewhere.
However I would make sure people are appraised of the risks involved and think twiceBe prepared to listen even if it's emotional. He really listens but the patient needs to know how to listen also and express all of their concernsI would advise anyone to come in equip with questions you have in mind. He is extremely knowledgeable but cannot read your mind and expectations.If you are looking for an out of the box thinker, or someone who treats you like a person, not just a number, he is not the Dr. for you.Dr. Tortoriello is a very tactful person. Try to tamper your aggression. Trust this doctor to do the best for you. Ulterior motives exit when Dr. T enters Have all your tests and documentation ready for her to review. Tell her your concerns. Try this doctor because you will not go wrong with him.  Be as open as you can about your concerns or symptoms.  Don't be afraid to push for more details and clarity when needed. He can sometimes act like the treatment is simplistic but if you ask questions he will always take the time to answer them thoughtfully.Do research so you better understand your hormone levels and how that impacts your IVF cycle.Ask questions for your comfort, but trust him completely. He is a true expert, as well as ethical and fair. Consider the team and not just the MD. All staff members impact your care.Be very honest with him about all your symptoms and trust him. General advice for all patients undergoing fertility treatments - read, read and read. Be prepared when you go on interview so you can have a conversation. Be your own advocate, know your own history, do research on all procedures. This knowledge will not only allow you to get the best results but will also save you a lot of money.See him first...not after schlepping through 2 factory centers first!!!Don't be shy to ask questions.  Dr. Wang is very responsive and he never makes you feel like your questions are a bother.See him now.   Don’t wait! Trust the process REally question her decisions, ask her why she keeps changing her mind. It felt like she was in a rush sometimes. Trust him. Trust him.  Also don't be shy about asking potentially stupid questions - even at 4am.Don't be afraid to ask questions - he always is patient and happy to explain thingsLearn as much as you can about DOR treatment planning from him as he has much experience treating women with DOR and over 40. NONE!See her as soon as you can so she can explore all options with you.Do your research before seeing any doctor. We were blinded by the fact that we wanted a baby so badly that we put all our faith in our doctor and didn’t question his decisions.No advice except see him first!Come in with all of your questions because she will make an effort to respond to them. Listen to him and trust him. Don't be afraid to ask questions - he's there for you. Listen to Cary and trust her
Make sure you ask questions. He will answer, but isn’t always direct with offering information that you might need to know in anticipation of your needs. Ask questions - be open - you're in good hands.  Don’t be afraid to discuss your fertility struggles and journey with him. He is very open-minded and is willing to work with his patients.Pay attention to your egg retrieval stats early on - he may overlook certain things.Stick with one doctor, switching won't helpShare all of your questions and opinions so he can help make you very comfortable.As questions and ask about all possible testing that can be done early onYou need to do your own research and bring those ideas and get his feedback. If you are looking for a doctor who not only listens and communicates, but also a doctor who CARES about you, Dr. Wang is the Dr. for you.She is the best! Call her for a consultation! You won't be disappointed. At sher, you will not feel like your at a fertility factory but rather a human who she will care for and get to know !To ask questions because they will be answered. It was a partnership.He no longer practices in NYC, but he is WELL worth the trip to Westchester You won't go wrong if you choose him! He will get you pregnant Trust her!Ask tons of questionsAsk a tons of questions! Don't be afraid to ask questions since Dr. Wang will answer any questions you have and never make you feel bad for asking them.Follow his instructions to the T, like he like to be called Dr. T, and be confident. Don't worry if he doesn't talk a lot, he knows what he is doing.Stay focused Dr T will take care and don't lose hopeJust trust him, and ask him if you have any questions. He will give you answers. Dr. T is very patient and thoughtful. Ask questions, because he has great info to offer. SIRM patients are often those who’ve not seen success elsewhere, so feel free to do research and come armed with what you’re looking for (how aggressive you’d like to move, concerns, etc). He’s very honest and has a dry sense of humor that could take some getting used to. sometimes it was hard to follow email trails because correspondence would come from multiple nurses. Ask many questions and take copious notes. You are going to love this dr. He is amazing doctor and person always answering your questions and being honest. He also has great bedside manners. Take her advice and listen to her she knows what she’s doing be patient Make an appointment and be willing to adjust your personal schedule to see the doctor every time. Don’t go to a factory with rotating doctors!! It’s worth it. Ask questions if you do not understand or want to know moreTrust him and you will get to where you want to be at. You are in good hands!Ger ready to get pregnant!Trust him. Expect honesty and to actually feel like a human not a pay checkIf things don’t work as planned first try keep trying and don’t loose hope. To be open and honest no matter what, because that’s how Dr T can best guide you ",9.0,8.300000000000008,"Ask questions, and be sure that you understand every aspect of the proposed treatment as well as the rationale. he is very open minded Ask as many questions as you must and avail yourself of asking questions of her via email or her team. My advice is that he is a really kind and caring doctor. If you are looking for an out of the box thinker, or someone who treats you like a person, not just a number, he is not the Dr. for you."
44,Sher Fertility of New York,nurse," His staff are always kind and smiling.  His nurse Cecilia is wonderful.  You can tell they work very hard to treat all patients with high level of care.I mainly worked with Frances Faundez and Cecilia Choe. They were both very easy to work with. They were very responsive even communicating via email. I always felt comfortable knowing they would provide instructions when it came to my calendar and medications dosages. A couple times I ran out of medicine over a weekend and they provided me with some until I was able to get mine so I didn’t miss a cycle. Frances was so compassionate and sweet when I had a miscarriage. And she took the time to make me feel like a person and not just another patient. The nurses are very organized about follow-ups, and are 100% available via email. I never had to wait more than an hour or so to get a response back to a question, and often it was within minutes.Again, because I was a satellite patient, I never really understood what role each nurse took. I also started with one nurse and then had another one emailing me. I felt they did not realize I was a satellite patient, so would send me my calendar after a monitoring appointment. They also forgot to order medications one time, which luckily turned out to be ok, but could have been an issue. I do think this was because of my status and would be different if i were an in office patientI actually communicated frequently with Dr T vs the nurse, which was a huge draw for me vs other larger clinics. The nursing staff overall was wonderful, very supportive and kind, sometimes you had to follow-up with them to be sure that they got your meds orders in but they were very flexible and even allowed me to come into the office to get the sample meds for free once when I didn't have any left. Jane Wong, Cecilia Choe and another nurse that I spoke with after clinic hours all treated me with immense compassion and always communicated with me on the phone, patient portal and via email. Everyone was wonderful at the office. Responsive, caring and attentiveCan't think of anything.I have not been a patient in the office for 4 years but back then my biggest issues with the office were with the staff. The nurses were not always correct about my medications and doses, but I was very knowledgeable  and knew there were mistakes. They definitely valued teamwork and worked together to provide good patient care. Every single nurse at Sher was amazing! Shout out to Cindy :)Marian was responsive, kind, and organized. We had one problem with communication that was frustrating - when we started our second cycle we did not have a full consultation, only a partial, so some decisions were made without our knowledge. They were responsive and rectified the situation with a mid-cycle consultation. We will not make the mistake again - the office staff in that case needed to be better as communicating as an entire team, but Marian herself was great. she even answered our late-night call when we had a panic attack about administering the double trigger We really love her and hope to work with her again.I have appreciated how through Cecelia has been, but on the phone she can speak a little too quickly for me to comprehend.  I have made her slow down/repeat multiple times.  She has been very kind to repeat.  All nurses that have taken blood have been AMAZING!  I usually have very bad veins and I have come out unscathed an mostly without any busing.  Even the receptionists are very friendly and cheerful.  I really appreciate for my 9 am appointments.Cecilia was available.  She even called me on her day off to let me know the results of a day 5 check of embryos.  She spent time with me on the telephone when I had questions or doubts or needed assistance in thinking through what made the most sense.  I felt very supported and that she cared about me/the success of my treatments.  She was genuinely very sad to let me know the results of the PGS testing for the first round (none of the embryos tested as viable).Frances is Dr. T’s right hand woman. Always lovely and kind and helpful and answered emails promptly even after business hours at times. Everyone is great, they explain in detail what to expect, they comfort you when you are upset, they are loving and compassionate. My nurse Marian was lovely.  Jackie another nurse there was incredible to me.  All the nurse staff even the ones that naturally had a rough way about them were all my angels.Cecilia is organized and helpful. On one occasion, she located a local pharmacy close to midnight for me when I was traveling and that allowed me to continue stims. The nursing staff I encountered on visits were always kind, professional and efficient. I wish they all wore name tags because I often ended up seeing the same people and while they knew me, after a while, it was awkward not to know theirs and to have to ask. Jacqueline, the coordinating nurse, once or twice was party to minor miscommunication, but it was always resolved quickly. She always had a lovely affect, which goes a long way.All the nurses at Sher were extremely organized and caring. I liked how they provided me with an email of what I had to do during sims. I liked this much better than phone communication. If I had any questions, I could email the nurse. Anytime I emailed them, they always got right back to me. Dr Wang has great nurses.  Leslie is the main nurse and Dr Wang's right hand.  She's amazing.  The other nurses - Cecilia and Lindsay - are also great.  They are quick  to reply to emails, and send out prescriptions to pharmacies quickly and to other clinics if you are monitoring remotely.  She was very responsive and supportive. Easy to talk to by email. Seems to know her stuff but for some reason I'm not blown away by her capabilities as a nurse.  I absolutely loved working with Lindsay. She was so incredibly helpful  and responsive. Having that kind of support made me feel like I had a team going through the process with me, rather than just me and my husband. Everyone seemed efficient. I don't have a lot to say about the nursing staff. All of the nurses and coordinators at Sher are very responsive. Like all clinics I do think you have to stay on top of them and be constantly checking that the plan is the same you agreed with the dr, the orders have been placed, etc. but they're generally very competent. My primary nurse was Bushra Suddal, but I also was helped by other nurses at Sher.  Bushra and all of the staff were absolutely amazing.  They were always responsive and answered all of my concerns immediately.  I have reached out to Bushra during after hours as well as on weekends and she always replied (email or telephone) to any questions I had whether it was a medication question or just a general question I had at the time.  The staff (no matter who I reached out to) was always quick to reply and handle any concern I had.  Making my appointments was always easy and I never had an issue getting a date and time that worked with my work schedule.  All the nurses were awesome, including my nurse coordinator, tho she started slipping a bit here and there. She sometimes gave incorrect updates which when I double checked was corrected. Generally, she was good, and I found two other nurses I could reach out to (also part of the team) who were always on point. Together, The team was amazing.She communicated with me practically daily and I actually feel bad at the number of times I had her call me!  she was patient and soft-spoken and read and responded to most emails within 15 minutes.We dealt closely with two or three nurses under Dr. Dicken. All were excellent. They were not only professional but were warm and friendly. It made a big difference to us that even the receptionists at the front desk remembered our names and greeted us warmly every time we saw them. Leslie was great!
Organized, responsive, and nice.Leslie is a great partner to Dr. Wang. She is quick to answer my emails and goes out of her way to help me out. I always got my prescriptions without any issues.Jackie, who communicates test results and instructions, is absolutely wonderful! She's friendly and greets each patient, and she's very efficient at communicating instructions and calling in prescriptions. The other nurses (it's changed a bit) that meet with you before your cycle are less helpful and often get instructions and information incorrect.always responded right away to email .... I did monitoring in Boston and she was in NYC and went above and beyond to get all my papers and info in right away. 1000% better than ppl at ""top clinic"" i went to in Boston Incredibly compassionate - I felt like Jackie felt everything I was going through personally and did everything she could to make me feel less alone. Nurse was extremely organized and thorough.  She was very busy and hard to reach but overall I enjoyed my experience with her.Quick to reply via email, quick to send in meds, etc.  I actually never met the primary nurse on my doctor's team because She only spoke by phone to my husband (I had a meeting at work) and she wasn't available when I had my injections class. But she was great over email and the nurse I met at the injections class and at my retrieval was warm and organized.Marian could be a little disorganized and on several occasions did send me calendars and medication details that were not reflective of what the doctor and I had spoken about. She is super responsive on email and quick to check with the doctor and correct the details. But I did need to be super on top of it and reconfirm everything. She is very very kind and compassionate. Leslie gets back to me quickly, just like Dr. Wang. However sometimes it takes a lot of back and forth to get a simple answer done. I feel like I need to follow up a lot to make sure things aren't forgotten or to make sure things are received. Often she'll tell me something wasn't received, so I have to call my local doctor or pharmacy and they will tell me it was sent, so there's a lot of back and forth and then Leslie will find it. I don't know if that's her fault or if maybe the office is not so organized in general.Leslie was very responsive to questions, prescription requests, etc.  She and Dr. Wang make a great team.They are all very nice, friendly and compassionate. They work pretty efficiently as well. Lindsay called and emailed me often. She is the sweetest nurse I ever met, and I have met many in my line of work. She would even call me after emails I would send late at night sometimes.My coordinator was Jacqueline.  All of the support staff are helpful and nice.  Jacqueline responded to me immediately.  She had a big smile every time I saw her.  I have absolutely nothing but great things to say about her. The nurses and front desk were a welcome sight durning such an emotional time. They understood the challenges of fertility and managing it with everyday life a family. Melissa who was my nurse coordinator did a good job explaining how to do all the injections and kept me updated about the next steps in the procedure. She was a little bit reserved and could have been a little bit more compassionate. We communicated a lot by email and she always replied in a timely manner. There was another nurse whom I particularly grew fond of. Her name is Jacqueline. She was so welcoming and nice. She really helped me go through the whole process.Excellent nursing staff. I had many of them work with me on various occasions and they were all amazing!I think the only issue that I have with the clinic is that my care coordinator changes ...and I'm never quite sure who it is. However all the nurses are lovely and competent - Jacqueline, cindy, Melissa, bouchra, etc. This only became an issue when it came to calendars and medications. I would have liked to understand why medication (and dosage) was changed each round, often it was changed back when I questioned it because the meds where in similar categories...but then why change it at all to begin with?The nurse was good, a bit overwhelmed at times, but ok. I had to remind her of medication that Dr. Oshaughessy suggested, and needed to make sure that she called in all the medication to the pharmacy - so I can't say she was very careful, but was helpful most of the time.Leslie has become a lifetime friend after being my nurse coordinator while I was cycling with Dr. Wang in 2014 and 2015.
We still keep in touch. Since I graduated from Dr. Wang, I have created a group of former, current and future patients of Dr. Wang called Wang Gang. We are about 90 ladies and we help each other in real life with advise, medications and support.The staff at Sher NYC is okay. They can do a better job of providing thorough and complete information to patients since they are the ones who make phone calls to patients and regularly provide them with information about next steps during treatment. Leslie was amazing to deal with. She was thorough and was on top of everything. She was super nice as well and emailed me back in a timely manner. Staff is very pleasant and prepared. Great staffThis is a combination of ratings for two nurses. First cycle the nurse didn't seem so organize. Then she wasn't there anymore. The second one and subsequent one for 2nd cycle were great. Very informative, clear on protocols, injection techniques, dates, what would happen, follow-up with results, labs etc. They have nice printed color coded calendars easy to follow. Can probably use more picture explanations of how/when/where to inject although the web is full of those. Nursing and care coordination was not very memorable. I didn't need hand holding so I don't think I relied on them for much other than coordinating beta tests.Jacqueline and Marian responded really promptly when I had questions or needed coordination with my old clinic who was still doing most of the monitoring. It was night and day between communication response times with Sher and my former clinic. Jacqueline made me feel really good when I showed up in NY, chatting and laughing with me. Leslie was very responsive and I felt I could always email her with any questions.  She send the prescriptions to my pharmacy promptly.  She even helped me with getting some paperwork from my previous doctor. 
Leslie kept me organized by sending me detailed calendar with each medication dosage and appointment/blood test scheduled.  She would follow up with new calendar if anything changed.  
Leslie spend an hour with me showing me how to administer each shot or each medication by myself which made me very confident when I had to do it at home. She also send me some video links in case I forgot. Always compassionate, however, tended to see many different nurses and instructions were not always clear.From very minor to big mistakes were made during my cycle.  I.E., Administering medication too earlier, not ordering a specific test day of transfer.I had to ask for instructions when I started injecting my medication; instruction was not offered. The nurse was rushed and the encounter was not helpful. The clinic's practice was to provide a link to a YouTube video, which did not exactly mirror my own situation. I had to rely on verbal advice from a nurse friend, by phone.All staff was easy to reach, professional, all issues were resolved on the same day. For example medication prescription issues.she was very warm and funny and I must have emailed her about twice a day for a month! She never complained and always was up beat.Leslie seems to be very organized and on top of all the details when it comes to coordinating an IVF cycle.  I was very impressed by her.I loved the nursing staff.  Most of the nurses were caring, but Jackie went above and beyond. When we found out we had a chemical pregnancy, Jackie gave me the warmest, comferting hug.  She gave us hope that the process would work. Strengths were emailing back right away.  Sometimes i wished to talk more on the phone for more personal experienceMellissa and Jaqueline were both amazing.Lindsay was very very sweet and she called me several times a week. She was very meticulous.She communicated clearly my treatment regimen. She also helped with procurement of  my medication
Francis was always available thru phone and email. She explained my results with care and empathyBushra was a bit disorganized but very kindStrengths--quickly responds to emails. No weaknesses.they were all quick to email and very good at being supportive and nice.Unfortunately the emails and instructions we received from the nurse were at times incorrect or confusing. But Dr. Wang was always able to clarifyI never met my nurse.  I also got conflicting information regarding my meds.  She told me one could be refrigerated and it couldn't.I never met her and it seemed hard to get direct answers when needed.They were on top of everything. Sweet, caring and explains things properly All of the nurses are great- I’ve worked with all of themLindsay was an excellent nurse! I absolutely loved her positive attitude. She answered all of e-mails promptly and in detail. Unfortunately, she left the practice once I was ready for a transfer. Response is super quick and she rarely makes a communication error. Frances Faundez was quick to respond to my emails or would direct me to the correct person.  She has a friendly demeanor.Just like dr very compassionate and understanding ",9.0,8.300000000000008,"You can tell they work very hard to treat all patients with high level of care.

I didn't need hand holding so I don't think I relied on them for much other than coordinating beta tests."
45,Sher Fertility of New York,clinic,"I really appreciated that this clinic was small and it felt intimate.  The nurses were great and the other doctors I saw were so wonderful and compassionate, even though I wasn't their patient. The most difficult part was dealing with billing.  It's been 3 years since I've been at the practice so maybe this has changed but I had a lot of hours spent trying to track down invoices and bill, etc.overworked.  as an out of state patient it was difficult to communicate.There were a lot of them so I was friendlier with some than others, but I got along with all of them and never had any unpleasant incidents of any kind in the three years I was a patient there. It helped that I could also always email my doctor directly too if necessary.Sometimes, there was confusion as to the appointment dates, test results, etc.
We attribute this to a lack of primary nursing help assignment. No malice.Our favorite nurse was Jackie. She was with us throughout both of our treatments. She got to know us as a couple and not just as patients. Very compassionate.It's a great clinic - never a long wait, always a good follow-through. Convenient location. There has been some rotation in the main nurse coordinators - I felt my first round had better main nurses. However, I was able to still get everything taking care off by emailing any open questions. Nursing team always did a great job with ordering meds - I did that as a combination OTC and via insuranceNurse did not reply to my messages, when replied seemed to ignore the questions -- this was very stressful, but if I would ask Dr. T, they would come back .   The first time we went to do a retrieval I was unable to do it because I ate the morning of.  I was extremely distraught the nurses were there to help ease my pain. And every single appointment there always very caring.  The day we found out that we were pregnant when we came in all the nurses were so excited for us and hugged us. The nursing staff is great, however my husband complained that getting blood drawn was painful and they collapsed a vein in his arm.I can’t say enough great things about Dr. Tortoriello and his wonderful staff.  After having a bad experience at a different clinic-we were referred to Dr Tortoriello by a close family member.  All I have to say is My husband and I will be forever grateful to Dr. Tortoriello.  His attentiveness,  caring demeanor, guidance and knowledge made me feel at ease the entire process.  His staff are always kind and smiling.  His nurse Cecilia is wonderful.  You can tell they work very hard to treat all patients with high level of care.  Most importantly I’m here holding my 2 month old beautiful baby girl thanks to Dr. Tortoriello!  He will be forever in my heart.  The nurses there were excellent. They were very organized and kind. I loved them.Helpful and responsive.They are a very organized clinic answering all questions and explaining protocols in a timely manner so you understand everything. They also help accommodate scheduling with work so does the dr. This is important because it’s not easy working and doing fertility treatments Great! It varies. I’ve worked with different nurses. Some senior nurses are great, very helpful and compassionate. 

First primary nurse was kind but extremely disorganized - forgot to send my calendar, forgot to order meds, missed some consents, didn’t submit insurance authorization for meds. Every step required chasing with repeated reminders, zero communication. 

Since then I have rotated between different nurses, some better than others.I think all the nurses should all be as compassionate and on the same page.  I know it’s hard when dealing with so many patients but it really does help. When the staff are all professional and kind and take the time to know your name It separates the practice from any other infertility practice. This journey is hard as it is and when you deal with a practice that is professional and doesn’t treat you like a number or rush you or lose patience with you it makes it more tolerable. Their strength I feel is that they are all compassionate and willing to help... even when they seemed swamped. The one advice I would have is to make sure that their front desk staff (not the 6th floor) is professional. Sometimes on the other floor when I would go in for a procedure the girls were a little loud and not well spoken or professional. I felt they were not as approachable. There are a lot of clinical coordinators at SIRM. Sometimes you’re not sure who to communicate with when a problem arises. The nurses were friendly, organized and communicative. I hate doing blood work because I have small veins but needed to do it every appt. but they were gentle and did a great jobAll the nurses I have dealt with were wonderful, however I am unsure if they are still there.Incredibly friendly and upbeat. They were such supporters of the whole process and felt like they were on our team!Leslie was amazing - she got back to me quickly even after hours and on the weekends.  I did remote monitoring so i didn't see many nurses in person but always helpful via email, over the phone or when I was there for procedures. Kind and respectful.Dr. Dicken's nurse Jackie is efficient, friendly and caring. She answers all our questions promptly, takes extra time to send us our blood test results levels (our request) after every blood test (and there are many!) and efficiently executes tasks accurately e.g. calling in prescriptions and conveying doctor's response.They were all very kind and encouraging. Again, I felt like a human at every turn. I will say I found it much easier to communicate via phone than email. In contrast to the first clinic I went to, SIRM never felt like a factory. There were never more than a couple women at a time in the waiting room, I never waited more than 10 minutes during a visit, and no one ever raised their voice at anyone (again, in contrast to my first clinic). The doctors do their own monitoring visits, so the only thing support staff do is blood. It's all very very calm and professional. Secondly, SIRM is very good with technology. Both the Dr and the nurses are available by email, and they send very clear instructions laid out by day on the calendar. They are also very fast on their insurance submittals.The nurses were friendly and professional, and provided great care.For the most part, they were very good. However, some were certainly better than others. Overall, they were all good st the care they delivered and organization. The staff was very informed and helpful. They were able and willing to answer questions, and consulted the doctor and got back to me in a timely manner whenever I had concerns.I saw many different nurses but all were competent and knowledgeable.  Some were more helpful and kind than others.Very friendly. Always willing to help. Sometimes there were different nurses assigned to me, but that didn't really make much of a difference.The nursing staff was very personal and compassionate. Also, they were very well informed and reassuring.They were the perfect compliment to Dr. Dicken's expertise.  Warm, caring, quite proficient... we left feeling like family and always knew we were working with intelligent professionals too.I had seen a different Dr at this clinic and was very satisfied.  It's an older office which looks antiquated compared to some other clinics.  Know as an out of state patient you might not get the same emotional care as other patients - I did not do any monitoring here. I did my monitoring in Virgina at RMSVA, which I have to say was wonderful. They treated me like I was their patient and they sent my results on a timely manner. Some nurses were fantastic, some were not as organized, and one was cold and never smiled.Physically the offices aren't as fancy/expensive-looking as Cornell or New Hope or NYU, but don't let that influence your decision because overall, SIRM-NY is high quality where it counts! The most important thing is to find a good doctor who you feel is the right person to have on your team for what can be a very long and challenging process, and I found that in this clinic. Their scheduling and front desk staff was also good, which I don't think I've mentioned yet but which makes a difference when you have to have as many appointments as fertility treatment involves!The clinic is very disorganized. Not all the nurses work every day so I don’t actually know who my nurse was because every day it seemed it was a different person.The clinic offers a variety of fertility doctors. It is centrally located. It is not the cheapest. But, its quality to cost ratio is very good. A little more nursing help (in the form of a dedicated nurse assigned to the case) would eliminate the majority of confusion that occasionally crept inMonitoring hours can be a little inconvenient, as they start at 8.45am. Besides that, I don't have many complaints about SHER as a whole. The nurses and front desk were kind and compassionate. The staff in the Westchester office are great and caring. The staff in the city office are rushed. The nurses that I worked with were quick to respond with thorough answers. All appointments are scheduled (as opposed to some other clinics that have open hours).  Its a bit annoying but your doctor does all your monitoring and procedures.  Amazing all aroundThe nurses who reached out to me after every tests were great. The nurses who took my blood tests were just ok...they bruised me a couple of times and couldn't answer some of my questions about what the test results would indicate.The clinic itself was very welcoming. The decor made you feel at ease while you waited in the sitting area. What we didn’t like was that the staff kept changing to often. Mostly every time we went there was a new receptionist. The nurses were not steady. For each visit we would have a different nurse in the room with Dr. T.Sher is a boutique clinic, you see your doctor when you go. They are very personalized. the only issue is with their billing, which is very disorganized. The doctor is very receptive and willing to explain and try new methods. The office is very intimate, and there is not too many people. They schedule monitoring 9-2, and i believe Dr does the monitoring. On one hand this is good, as it takes less time, on the other hand, one cannot go there before work.  My nurse was pretty bad, not ordering drugs, not answering emails etc. Everyone was great at drawing blood quickly and neatly. All were very kind and friendly. Matter of fact - but knew their stuff and communicated well.Strengths-friendly and knowledgeable staff, availability of nurses after hours, and clinic is open daily
Weaknesses-messages on patient portal are not always answered in a timely fashion, assigned doctor may or may not perform treatments on assigned patient
They are very sweet, attentive and diligent. Some are better than others but they were all good at their jobs. The nurse and financial teams are not as great as Dr. Wang. There were missed communications, schedules not updated, etc. I had to really carefully ask questions and manage my care to make sure mistakes weren't made.Nuetral It is a much smaller feel having some of the larger fertility clinics.  I always felt well cared for by the front desk staff, nurses and of course Dr. Dicken Appointments were somewhat inflexible. The doctor could only provide treatment in morning hours. Afternoons seemed to be reserved for new patients.Good with blood work, more attentive Very kind and always ready to help and explain things.They were so kind and compassionate.  Greeted well during each visit. Coordinated well to pass on information on time. A strength of SIRM is they test and treat conditions that the typical clinic may not even test for.  I regret not seeing them sooner.  Perhaps I could have had a successful  transfer of a PGS tested embryo if I was given proper treatment for NK cells.Their lab was high level, so you can trust their techniques to develop your eggs there. I am not sure what are their weaknesses. Their strengths must come from their doctors' passion, and Dr. T was always his best when he sees his patients. Also, he is searching for new meds to treat his patients, and he is open to accept suggestions from his patients too. Nursing staff was very nice, organized and compassionate. They tended to rotate between doctors so I often saw different staff. When I was a patient 4 years ago, the only weakness was the lack of compassion from some of the staff. There were many more strengths than weaknesses. I loved that I always saw Dr T. I never saw another doctor for anything. Responsive, professional, friendly.          I thought the clinic was great - both my experience with the Dr. T and the nurses was top notch and I would gladly recommend them to a friend..............The offices are very clean, cozy and welcoming. The staff are very professional and compassionate. All of the different practitioners know their stuff and do their very best to be attentive and supportive. I feel like Dr. T and his staff knew exactly what to do and didn’t waste time with clinic, IUI etc. I personally know 3 other women who have had success with them. 
The only weakness I can think of is that sometime there would be a very long wait  at the office so expect to be there a while. I wish Sher had NJ locations. The clinic is small and very organized which I think is exactly what you want. The staff is extremely nice ans responsive and always try to help in any manner they can. The nurses doing your blood work are also very competent which is important specially if you end up going weekly! Everything is very cleanLovely people who also put me at ease at every step of the process All the nurses were very friendly and knowledgeable. Appoints always available, easy to work through and insurance / payment questions.  The staff was always accommodating and there to help with anything needed.  Great teachers as well!  During IVF the nurses were great at helping to set up ordering all meds, showing how to inject, etcSHER is willing to work with patients who have DOR which was our biggest priority. I previously did a cycle at RMA who treated me like a number for sure. All doctors are skilled in this sub-area. The clinic is great about sending instructions and calendars, has very responsive and communicative staff who are always available by email, and has a great late-night nursing call back system. I would highly recommend for a patient with diminished ovarian reserve as they are one of few clinics who will go to retrieval for one or two eggs.Strengths: I really like my doctor, and like that it’s a smaller clinic with more personalized care. I love that my doctor does every scan and procedure herself, this is a huge advantage over larger clinics.

Weaknesses: they are experiencing financial difficulties and it shows, they seem increasingly disorganized and understaffed. Logistics at every step have been a challenge, if I didn’t have leftover meds from my prior clinic I would have had to cancel my cycle.

I saw a different attending doctor one day who provided conflicting (incorrect) information with poor bedside manner. However, this only happened once vs my prior clinic where it was the norm to see a different doctor every day.Incredibly clean and calming.  There are two floors and I'm occasionally confused about which floor to report to.  As I had said, the receptionists are wonderful!  They start off my appointments on the right foot.The doctors and nurses are very communicative and supportive.  I did feel as though there needed to be more communication between billing and the drs/nurses.  We were initially billed for storage of embryos that did not PGS test as viable and which Dr. T wouldn't transfer, which was a little frustrating.  Strengths - small, kind, helpful, compassionate staff. Frances and Ivana went above and beyond. Also, I forget her name but the nurse who took my bloods and assisted Dr. T during examinations etc. was wonderful as well. It is one of the best clinics I have been to for any healthcare. They really don’t have any weaknesses. They worked around my cycle, they are available at night, on weekends, they respond immediately to emails and calls. I love Sher! I believe the embryology lab at SIRM is top notch. Financial can be difficult to navigate. And honestly it would be so much easier if each patient were assigned a dedicated clinical coordinator/nurse. It’s also no picnic trying to cycle out of town as a satellite patient. You really have to be your own advocate and review all of the calendars they send you. Sher Fertility's strength is that it is a boutique clinic that can provide personalized care. You never feel like a number. The staff is 
professional, organized and efficient. They are open on weekends, and I never had any issues with wait times.This clinic is small and personal. The doctors are flexible and the nurse staff is wonderful. I felt well taken care of even though I did not have the outcome I wanted.  When I got naturally pregnant after years of failed treatments I went back to this clinic because I could not imagine getting treatment from anywhere else. That was unfortunately a miscarriage at 8 weeks but I was so grateful to go through that surrounded by so many kind people who knew me.Strength: you feel less like a number comparing to other clinics since  it's a small clinic. They accept insurance. They treat DOR patients and don't give them the donor egg speech. 

Weakness: if you are not a local patient, you don't have the frequent interaction with your doctor.Very nice facility. Some weird art. The staff knew me and again always struck me as efficient and conscientious. While Dr. Dicken was based on the 6th floor mostly, many procedures are on the third floor, and that could sometimes be confusing. Doctors cover for each other occasionally, and the in interactions I had with Dr. Tortoriello and Dr. Wang, I found them both pleasant, responsive and effective. I liked this clinic very much. Everything was organized and I always felt I was treated with respect. The nurses were always friendly and there was never a long wait. I was always seen within minutes of arriving at the office. Since I am a teacher, the office staff worked with me to accommodate my schedule. I like how they communicate via email and are always quick to answer any questions. This clinic is great to work with whether you are local to NY or if you live in another city.  By being so easy to communicate with the nurses and the doctors, you never feel like you are far away or that you will be forgotten. 
They do make mistakes now and then as all clinics, and people in general, are apt to make, but because they are so readily available through email, corrections are made quickly.
The only team that can be difficult to get answers from is the financial team. Boutique
Appointments rather than open monitoring
Don't feel like a number 
It's almost always empty which makes me nervous!
Big staff and sometimes feels disorganized
Modern facilities 
Modern communications 
Financial coordination is great Sher has a pretty good system so for the most part you only deal with your primary physician. I had to come in on the weekend once for an ultrasound and met a different doctor on call but in terms of the care I received, it was the same. The clinic itself seemed to be undergoing some changes in management right around the time that I became a patient there. The financial division was somewhat difficult to work with prior to the onset of my cycle. But the clinic itself, or rather the chain of clinics, are nationally renowned for their outside of the box thinking and their successes with the most difficult of cases. Sher is a small clinic. You won't be in a massive waiting room of people for monitoring hours. You will only see your doctor for monitoring so you will have to work with their schedules a bit but it's worth it. It's not the most modern office but everyone is very nice and you feel taken care of. I love the fact that Sher is a boutique type of clinic.  Everyone is always available to speak with you whether you are there in person, over the phone or via email.  The office is bright, clean and just overall inviting.  The staff always greets you with a smile.  I honestly can not think of any weaknesses I experienced during my treatment.  They are open on the weekends for monitoring and are very good at making sure you are seen at your appointment time.  I have never had an issue waiting to be seen.  I always saw Dr. Tortoriello during my visits.  Overall, I had a great experience.  It’s hard for me to make much of a complaint on the clinical side, they gave me my rainbow baby at 45 with my own eggs. To me they are IVF superheroes. On the clerical side, I was told the day before my transfer that I owed a substantial amount of money even though I was assured these charges were covered by insurance. I found it to be terrible timing and also not cool that the insurance coordinator wasn’t clean on what was covered. The lady was very sweet, but she needed to be more precise about that.  The 6th floor is beautiful to look at and very well run. I waited never more than 10 minutes. (Plus they have my favorite cookies out). They need to open a bit earlier though as I had to rush to work after each visit.This is a relatively small clinic, which for us was a plus. Before going to SHER, we first went to another facility that was much larger and felt like an assembly line where no one knew our name; frankly, we came to feel unwelcome at this other facility, as though we were dragging down their success statistics. In contrast, SHER was a smaller, kinder and more welcoming place, while still being totally professional. 
As we were nearing the end of our treatment, SHER was sold to another company. Some changes started to happen, such as reorganization of offices and departments, but we saw only a little of this as we were on our way out (happily, we became pregnant and had a baby). So because we didn't have much experience with SHER after the sale, we don't feel that we can fully evaluate it today.I never had to wait more than 5 minutes when I came in for an appt. After my appt they were very quick and good in explaining my next steps. I would have to say timeliness was their biggest strength. For weakness I would say I wish they had someone like a social worker or therapist on hand or that the recommend. Going thru this process can be very hard on your mind and being able to talk to someone about what your feeling would have been greatOther staff members were not so great.  The technician that assisted during my egg retrieval was unfortunately very nasty.  I sent the clinic an email about her.

I found this woman to be rude.

Other staff member were nice but at times insensitive.  I think because some of the aides were young and not trained well enough on dealing with fertility patients.  You see your doctor at every appointment (unless it's the weekend-rotating schedule). Small and personal approach. Billing department seems to be disorganized, you need to be on top of your account and insurance info.The billing dept is the worst. I always get random bills and can't tell if it's truly the most up to date reflection of how much I owe. Some of the nurses are more warm and fuzzy than others.  The front desk is great once you get to know them and they have gone out of their way to help me with scheduling my appts.Their approach to patients is the best I've seen. There is no ""cattle call"" for morning check-ups (you always have an appointment), you aren't seen by any doctor on staff (you always see YOUR doctor), and you know that everyone there knows your unique situation and is working to help YOU.They truly make the process as easy as possible for you. Everything runs on-time and almost seamlessly. Everyone, even doctors, email with you in record time. It's a warm, inviting environment, and staff take the time to get to know you. I'd never go anywhere else!They are small which I like.  You don't feel like a number - you get individualized care.  Everyone seems to work after hours and on weekends to answer questions for you. The billing department can be disorganized though. I only went there for retrieval and transfer. I was surprised it wasn't more sleek/new/shiny but in the end that didnt matter .... if you travel from out of state it is very easy. we used hotels tonight to get  cheap hotel The clinic’s strengths are that it has Flexible hours, great team, great with technology (e.g. email), resourceful (I.e. each doctor has their own expertise) , open minded (I.e. supportive of holistic measures like acupuncture) and comprehensive beyond just the medical/technical work involved (e.g.
They have financial counseling).This clinic is not a factory.  The receptionists knew me by name and were always cordial and helpful.  I always got the early appointments I wanted so that I could go to my monitoring before work, which was very helpful.  It always feels very orderly and zen-like in the waiting area. The staff that picks up the phone/coordinates appointments are professional and efficient. The clinic's schedule is managed so well that I am simultaneously always able to get an appointment and yet there is never a wait to see the Dr. Clinic is small boutique style which is nice.

Compare this embryology lab to some of the more reputable clinics: NYU, CCRM Colorado, Cornell.  Their SART rates are much higher.  In retrospect, I regret not choosing another clinic regardless of my outcome because at least I would trust my eggs/embryos were in good hands!The billing system here is very frustrating in that they're very slow to file claims and don't always get it done right the first time.  That said, it's worth the price of admission to see Dr. Wang, so don't let it discourage you.  Just be prepared to not get bills right away and to sometimes get improper bills.  The finance department always gets it sorted out, but it takes a while. 
Strengths: quick communication, billing was smooth (I have insurance), easy to make appointments in the near future.  I only had to wait a long time in the waiting room once, and it was in the weekend so I didn't care too much.Sher (SIRM) is a much smaller clinic than most in NYC but is still very highly rated. The best part is the you always see your doctor. Your doctor does all your monitoring, your retrievals, your transfers - unlike some of the bigger clinics where the doctors all rotate. I think when you're dealing with multiple cycles and poor responses, this type of connection is so important.  The outward appearance of the clinic is not the most modern - they could probably use a little office face lift, but the quality of the care makes up for that. The reception and nursing staffs are kind and familiar. They accommodate appointments easily. It may not seem like an important detail, but there is never a packed waiting room so you don't feel like you're being herded through like I have felt in other places.  The doctors are still busy and dealing with lots of patients, but you very much feel like a patient and not a number when you're at Sher. SIRM has a lovely, modern waiting room. As for the pre-op and operating rooms, I found them a bit outdated. I was surprised that the operating room was separated by just a curtain from the hallway, and I remember looking at a lot of messy shelves in the OR while I was waiting for the anesthesiologist. But in the end, it isn't pretty ORs or facilities or even the nurses or office staff that make a place great - it's the doctors and the lab that are going to get you your baby. And with Dr. Wang and the embryologists at SIRM NY, you've got a winning combo.Dr. Wang is the clinic's strength.  I have heard good things about their embryologist and lab as well.  Billing practices and cost of treatments/cycles is very expensive and prohibitive. It's a small clinic with personal care - this is what we needed after being at Columbia where we never knew who we would see and did not get to really know our primary doctor and vice versa. At Sher, we feel very much seen. One time they messed up our consultation appointment time and that was annoying. But that was the only bump, logistically. The facilities are nice as well. I don't feel ""gross"" going there. I feel comfortable. It's a small clinic, which I found helpful in navigating treatment, schedules, and billing. Nurses sometimes goofed on details of drug protocols and scheduling, but I just made sure to check things and follow up. They were always very kind and accommodating. The strength is the doctors professionalism and compassion, and the same is true for his nurse. i saw many medical assistants and they were all friendly enough.  The lab must also be good too as I got pregnant.Strengths: Scheduled appointments (no early morning blood draws).  Front desk staff was efficient.  Care coordinator is amazing!  

Weaknesses: Not all doctors are created equal.  Not all doctors will be as great as yours.  (Pray your Doctor shows up on the day of your procedure)  Also, they need better monitoring equipment (you can not see what they see on ultrasound.  In other clinics, there is a tv on the wall so you can view it too.  No justified system where you can find your bloodwork results (you have to ask your coordinator to give you details).  From the moment I walked in the door I was treated with compassion. The nurses knew my name, which made it feel like a comfortable place to be. My doctor was available, direct, but would consoul me when I needed it. I truly have wonderful memories from my experience, I can not think of any weaknesses.SHER institute is a great clinic to do your IVF with. The doctors working there are all at the top of their field and have great bedside manners. The clinic treats you like a human being. You see one doctor all the time. The rooms are friendly and clean. 
The downside, they are very pricey, when you have to pay out of your own pocket. They don't offer any grants or discounts for people who don't make so much money like other clinics do. The accounting department is horrible. They gave us a lot of stress with wrong invoices. For example, they charged us for egg freezing while we didn't have anything to freeze. This was not only unprofessional, it was also very insensitive because we would have loved to have more embryos to try for a second child.
Also, the girls at the reception desk are not so well trained. For example, I was denied an appointment because the girl didn't know the difference between starting a cycle and doing some pre-testing. I had to contact the doctor directly who sorted things out very quickly.Sher has a nice office space, conveniently located in midtown.  We never had to wait for an appointment!  They opened at 8:00, which allowed me to come in for monitoring before work.  They are able to check what your insurance covers before you start treatment, and are organized with billing.It is small and more of a 'boutique' clinic. Individual appointment times for monitoring are a huge plus. 
The biggest weakness is that it is extremely expensive, much more than competing clinics. the clinic is great - easy to get an appointment, little waiting time, friendly staff. The office is being renovated and the newer floors are beautiful - older floors are fine but a little dark.The SIRM Institute has many strengths, including it's ""non factory-like"" feel, easy scheduling of appointments, wide variety of ways to communicate with patients, and amazing doctors.  Sometimes I had experiences with incorrect billing and needed to really stay on top of all bills, insurance claims, and paperwork.The clinic itself is wonderfully laid out. Receptionists and financial planner are great! Very patient, taking time to answer any questions. The ONLY criticism I could possibly think of would be that you cannot really make a set appointment time in advance. You call and request your day and preferred time, then they call you to confirm the day before. Mostly though, the time they set is on or close to your preferred time. Also- I personally would prefer later appointment times, but they are not available beyond about 2-3pm. Very clean, very bright, very well staffed. Easy to get to in mid town NY. The only drawback is the changed their prices and they heavily increased the costs of all treatments. Sometimes it's takes a few days for the financial department to get back to you.The clothes mix was well run. I wish the hours went into the evening. Juggling work and treatment was very difficult. Also, I wish the financing staff were more readily available.Don't have any negative comments.  Love that the practice has an office manager who researched our insurance coverage, then met with us to review costs ahead of time... this is a HUGE benefit. Scheduling was easy and appointments on time.  We've had some invoice needs after our care, and appreciate how quickly we get responses and information via phone or email.Weaknesses: Care coordination from cycle to cycle and payment procedures. 
Strengths: staffThe clinic was very small, clean and quite well organized in terms of scheduling. I never had an issue with scheduling.
The billing process however was very disorganized, they very convincingly sent me a bill for additional $2,000 and were pushy with immediate payments. 
Given that this is a private clinic,  I did have the feeling that much of the treatments and tests were cost driven.monitored out of stateThe clinic is not the typical cookie cutting clinic like Cornell, NYU or RMA. It is a charming little place where everybody knows you by name and you don't have to wait to be seen. 
It is in the heart of Manhattan so it is very easily accessible for all ladies coming from all over the world to find success.
You will be treated in the best way possible by the entire staff!There are several doctors in the group and they communicate with each other to get advice about their patients. I really like that. It was great to know that my doctor was getting input from more than one physician about my situation and how to best help me. This clinic was overall really good. I had a good experience with everyone here even though I had 2 failed IVFs. They are communicative and pretty organized as well. I cannot think of any weaknesses. It's the opposite of a factory. Clinic has good doctors and good office and flexible cycle dates as well as individual cycle dates. We did not normally wait a great amount of time. I think a handful of times we had to wait because there was an emergency or doctor had to be somewhere else that ran late but the vast majority of the time it was very good.Always answer the phone quickly. Get back to you in a reasonable time. Because a lot of this happens on weekends etc they seem to have a good system organized for all of that. Only problem is that a lot of appointments the actual time is not given until day before which can be tough but they are or try to be accommodating. Given the issues of who cycles/bodies work not sure if this can be helped. The physical place is a little too pink for my taste seems from another time but I'm glad they've kept a nice group of people who seem happy to be there and do their job well. The clinic manager is really great helping with insurance etc. The billing company is in Nevada, they don't seem quite as organized but this year are better.The clinic doesn't employ the friendliest individuals on the phone. I know the staff may feel overrun but you are in the business of helping desperate families, a little compassionate would go a long way. I think there is some room for improvement when delivering bad news. Terrible communication. They never receive faxes. I send same documents multiple times to the same fax number (called first to confirm the number).
The office forgot to send a procedure order when I was traveling, so the entire cycle was canceled because they forgot. Then I left this clinic.Dr. Dicken is on the 6th floor which is decorated really nicely and feels good to be in. The 3rd floor where I had to go a couple times for monitoring, isn't as nice. But all the staff are kind and friendly. It's a small clinic and I didn't feel like a number in a factory. It's in busy Midtown Manhattan so don't try to drive and park. Clinic is very organized.  Appointments are on time.  I never waited more than 10 minutes and most of the time my wait was less than 5 minutes.  

Staff is pleasant. The waiting room is clean and not crowded. Hours and location were convenient for monitoring appointments. Retrievals and transfers were done in the NYC office, which was also accommodating with hours (my transfer was on a Sunday). Did not batch patients which I liked. However, sometimes long waits. The reception staff in the Westchester office were sometimes less than understanding and could be abrasive.STRENGTHS: *sono & blood monitoring appointments are on time, *the waiting room is NOT crowded. *medical staff returns emails fairly quickly *old ""matrixed"" billing system was updated making medical expenses a lot easier to understand.
WEAKNESS:  *the outcome for IVF retrieval and IVF transfer is sent via email. If your results are good, great! However, if it is not reading that via email could be traumatizing.  *several instances were I was not informed that a retrieval or transfer would be performed by another doctor until I arrived. *If you have a billing issue be prepared for a long wait before your issue is addressed and/or resolved.  
The clinic is pleasant and clean. I occasionally had a hard time being buzzed in first thing in the morning. The staff was solicitous, but throughout my long treatment process, problems arose. I was given conflicting or incorrect advice about obtaining medical records, when to fast vs. not fast before a procedure, when to have an empty vs. full bladder before a procedure, whether to take certain medications while fasting.Keep track of what you do. If you send fax then call and confirm your fax was recieved, stay on top of things, ask questions, double check things if needed.Great. new offices. Clean and bright.  Great doctor and nurse.  Lab must be great too as I made the best embryos I ever made.  Need better cookies in the waiting room though..the biscotti has to go!The clinic's main strength is Dr. Wang himself.  Patients come to the clinic for him.  The clinic's main weakness seems to be some of it's other support staff.  The administrative staff seems to be less knowledgeable about billing, insurance, scheduling out of town patients, etc.I only went to SIRM for Dr. Wang.  I feel the clinic is pretty expensive when compared to other options. Dr. Wang was absolutely worth it, but I’m not certain I’d pay on that level for anyone else.  The clinic has a great location and is clean and professional, nothing bad to say about the space or basic set-up. My only issue with the clinic is scheduling appointments. They will not schedule out appointmeant too far in advance for minetering. The front staff were always friendly & welcoming. The embryologist was amazing & worked hard. The nurses  in the office were friendly & always answered questions with a quick response. The clinic is great with an amazing team.  They have all of the facilities needed and are always available when you need them.  They are organized and everyone treats you nicely.  I recommend them and they make you feel comfortable throughout the processSher NYC has serious billing issues. It took me months to get a refund and the staff were very slow to respond to me.  They are not the friendliest staff up front.  I have heard many people having the same problems as me

 .This clinic was clean and organized. I felt comfortable going there.I love Sher and would highly recommend them to anyone seeking fertility treatment.SIRM is great.  Sixth floor is brand new and gorgeous. The MAs and nurses, especially Lindsay, are very kind and sweet and all KNEW ME. It would be nice if Dr. T had earlier appointments but that is the price of seeing one doctor and not twenty different docs.A very organised and we'll put together clinic. Pay extreme attention to detail. Communication is key to them. I. Got a call reminding me of all appointments and what's expected of me. I didn't feel alone at any point
Small, short wait times. Front desk person is smart and organized. I always felt like I was in good hands. They do their lab testing on the premises, so you never have to wait long for results. This place is terrific. It's a boutique atmosphere - not a ""factory"".  It feels good to be a name not a number.Strengths: convenient location, friendly and caring staff, attentive doctors. Great online portal. 

Weaknesses: facility is outdated, communication can be improved. Would be better to have one clinic staff member per patient instead of pooled clinicians.Nice location, clean, spacious, privacy, easily accessible, clean restroom, refreshments available, soothing environment, no screaming or hustle, designated areas for nurses, nice waiting area, things available to read, Fine.  Nothing good or bad to mention.  I would not say it impacted my experience either way.  Don't be surprised if you have to wait sometimes, but never anything too long.  Clinic was always very cleanVery organized. Very expensive.  You need to be on top of your stuff.  You get to see your own doctor at every visit.  Nice office. Kind staff.  They do immune workup also.  They dont open early so you cant fo before workI am monitoring in a different state. The clinic was organized and effecient. The Dr. & staff was kind & compassionate.It is a smaller clinic for NYC but felt very personable. I was able to feel comfortable and see my doctor for every monitoring appointment. that was a real plus.The clinic is small. The offices and decor feel a bit dated, but are perfectly suitable for the treatment we sought. The office is clean and bright, with tea in the waiting room –  does not feel dreary like a hospital. 
I liked that you could make and appt.  it was very easy to get to via train.  Loved that you could make an appt. yet appts. always ran way behind and I was promised later appts and then when I was cycling suddenly there were only morning appts.  So I had to miss a ton of work. The clinic is small but very efficient and clean.
The only negative is that they don't have their own lab so you have to wait longer to get the results of your tests. Other than that it is in a very central and convenient location.They have the best doctors in this clinic. Amazing staffs and there is 100% hope for patients going to this clinic to get successful . Prompt response from the call center representative. Appointments are quick and flexible. Early appointments for working professionals.  Better results when compared to other clinic. Treatment methodology is very different from other clinic which gives better result Sher is a smaller clinic than RMA but I liked that because you get more personal attention. It is a nice, bright office and very friendly staff. It takes a bit of time to get an appointment but worth it.This is a boutique clinic that makes you feel confident in your investment, both from a financial and time standpoint. You can book monitoring appointments which is a huge plus for anyone who’s also been treated at a “farm” like NYU or
RMA. Only downside is some issues with billing - this department is not as organized as the doctors and nurses and I had some misunderstandings which had to be sorted out. Make sure you’re familiar with your coverage and are billed as such. Dr T always made exceptions for me to come in for monitoring in the afternoons to accommodate my work schedule. Everything is great had a great experience and wish I could do it all over again but we cannot afford it right now but dr brownes office is great and works with you and helps as much as they can. I would recommend them a millions times if I could Boutique feel, clean& organized. Again- you must make an appointment with your doctor as there are not bulk monitoring sessions. You are a person and not a number. They will know you. This is essential with something as stressful as an infertility battle The clinic's strengths was that Dr. Tortoriello was able to use his advanced knowledge to assist us to have a child. We interviewed with other doctors who told us that there was nothing more we can do. Dr. Tortoriello confirmed that he had new techniques that we could try to help us. The clinic's weakness was dealing with my insurance company. I had to bear the load of reaching out to my insurance company about payments for procedures. This was extremely time consuming but I did not mind doing it since I wanted to save myself money.Small settings, not too many patients, no significant wait time. Front desk is very kind and friendly. Dr. T’s team (including his coordinator) is solid and we had no complaints. One thing is that we cannot make an appointment via its website - it would be nice if the web-portal site is up and running. Everything was great.  One of the front desk workers input my telephone number incorrectly which led to miscommunication with one of my appointments but other than that they were kind to me.  Always offered me water and asked how I was doing.Beautiful calming environment where you don’t feel like 1 in a thousand. You are usually only one of 3 ppl there vs a prior clinic where I sat in an uncomfortable bench with 20+ women waiting to be monitored. I never felt like a piece of cattle at Dr T’s office and that meant a lot. Absolutely amazing so helpful caring and compassionate. Talked us through everything. And understood what we were going through. Felt at ease after our first visit after the first dr we saw was horrible at another clinicLoved the clinic. Everyone was very friendly. Easy to get in touch with them and to get an appointment. Never really had to wait. Everything was very clean and I always felt comfortable. Everyone was very professional. I will gladly go to them again for our next and already have recommended them to friends. I am a satellite patient and I monitored out of town and flew in for egg retrievals. It’s difficult but not impossible to do this but you have to be prepared to manage a lot of the appointment go-betweens yourself. I do remote monitoring in another state, so Im not aware of Sher's practice when it comes to monitoringI have always been able to get the early morning appointments. The office is extremely quiet and I'm seen as soon as I check in.I was an out of town patient that monitored locallyI did my monitoring remotely, so I can't talk about the monitoring appointments at SIRM-NYC.  However, I CAN say that for remote patients, Dr. Wang and his office do a great job of getting results and orders handled and providing feedback within several hours. 
I had scheduled appointments for each visit. As I left the office I would book the next one. Sometimes I would have a time that was later than I wanted, but they would always manage to work with my work schedule.  Once Dr. T waited to see me at 5:30pm !The monitoring appointments fit well into my schedule and once I was there, the wait times weren't long. It was a pretty smooth process.Monitoring appointments were scheduled generally early in the morning, but everyone was put on a waitlist with desired times. Usually if i requested lets say 8:30, i would get that time. So the appointment process was quite easy to manage.They were very accommodating with monitoring. Dr. Wang often came in 10 minutes earlier to see me so that I would not be late to work since I worked over an hour away.I had a tricky schedule and the clinic was able to work around my availability. Dr Wang completed all of his ultrasounds. The appointments were in the afternoon. He was always thorough. He always explained everything he saw. They were very accommodating with my work schedule.Easy to scheduleMonitoring appointment are usually quick. When you schedule for an appointment you will approximately being called for the procedure or monitoring around the same time. If you plan accordingly it will be as quick as grabbing a coffee from starbucks",9.0,8.300000000000008,"I really appreciated that this clinic was small and it felt intimate. The one advice I would have is to make sure that their front desk staff (not the 6th floor) is professional. Their scheduling and front desk staff was also good, which I don't think I've mentioned yet but which makes a difference when you have to have as many appointments as fertility treatment involves!The clinic is very disorganized. Nuetral It is a much smaller feel having some of the larger fertility clinics. Their strengths must come from their doctors' passion, and Dr. T was always his best when he sees his patients. Nursing staff was very nice, organized and compassionate. You don't feel like a number - you get individualized care. In retrospect, I regret not choosing another clinic regardless of my outcome because at least I would trust my eggs/embryos were in good hands!The billing system here is very frustrating in that they're very slow to file claims and don't always get it done right the first time. Amazing staffs and there is 100% hope for patients going to this clinic to get successful . I do remote monitoring in another state, so Im not aware of Sher's practice when it comes to monitoringI have always been able to get the early morning appointments."
46,Sher Fertility of New York,protocol,"I remember all of this, but I did too many cycles to be extremely specific here. To give a quick overview, though, after my first disastrous high stim cycle (nothing frozen), I then always did a low-medium stim cycle with Femara for a few days, then added anywhere from 75-300 FSH plus a small dose of HGH (Omnitrope .5mL or less) per day. We then added Ganerelix to suppress ovulation when that became necessary, until it was time for retrieval. The standard 10,000iu hCG trigger shot was used every time. Occasionally we did a luteal phase start. The rationale for this was that the super high stim protocol oversuppressed me and my AFC was never that high anyway (although we would never start a cycle with less than 4, which meant I took off a couple of months after every cycle so my follicle count could replenish itself a bit). With this protocol, I always had at least 1 blastocyst frozen per cycle. I didn't do genetic testing so I've no idea how many of those embryos are normal, butvam assuming at least a few of them probably are.Some treatment of immunology issues was done on me, it did not hurt probably.
I also was taking hgh. Dr. T also adjusted protocol in the beginning of the cycle, given my hormone levels (there was a switch in drugs, and i actually lost some money on that).  Since the results were dismal, I am not sure it worked.Genetic testing- because it seemed a standard practice there. Egg retrieval and embryo transfer.I have not yet begun treatment, only diagnostic testing.  Will update this as I advance through treatment.I received a few rounds of lipids during the first 8 weeks of my pregnancy at the Sher office. I also gave myself daily Lovenox injections throughout my pregnancy. Placental health is of utmost importance to maintain a healthy pregnancy, especially with a history of miscarriages. Our first cycle, we used 150iu of Menopur and 150iu of Gonal F, then added in 250mg of Cetrotide three days before retrieval. We triggered with HCG. The rationale was to not overmedicate, as I have DOR and too much medication can compromise the quality of eggs. We retrieved 4 eggs, and froze one 5-day embryo, which tested PGS normal. The second cycle, we hoped to have similar results but possibly retrieve more eggs without compromising quality, so we kept the protocol the same for the first five days, but then increased the Gonal f to 225iu on the sixth day, and added  1mL of Omnitrope (HGH) to increase egg quality. We also started the Cetrotide sooner to allow the eggs to grow a bit longer while preventing premature ovulation. We triggered with a combination of HCG and Lupron. That cycle, we retrieved 9 eggs, though only 6 were mature. Of those six, three made it past day 3, and 2 made it to freeze. We tested both - one came back PGS normal, and the other was inconclusive (the cells that were biopsied did not have enough DNA to run the test - annoying). We are about to start a third cycle and will probably keep the treatment the same as the second, because we were happy with the results.Estrogen prime antagonist protocol + PICSI:
- estradiol, follistim 150iu, menopur 150iu, ganirelix, HGH, dual trigger (Lupron, Novarel)

Supplements, acupuncture, thyroid medication.

We prime every month but base treatment on my antral count at baseline to maximize results, delay stims until CD4 or 5 (long cycles).

Results: 3 eggs retrieved, one day 6 embryo frozen. Prior doctor said I would never be able to retrieve more than 1-2 eggs per cycle, so this was above expectations.We are still in testing consultation mode after returning from a two week vacation.  Our next steps will be IUI if needed.I first went through three IUIs for insurance coverage purposes.  I used clomid in the first and third cycles.  The third cycle led to a chemical pregnancy which slightly delayed moving forward with IVF.

I had to do three egg retrievals.  Given my age, we PGS tested all embryos that survived to day 5.  For the third retrieval, Dr. T decided to add in HGH...it was this cycle that led to the ONE embryo that tested viable and which we then transferred.Started with clomid even though I pushed that because I was new to fertility treatments and nervous about injectables, IVF etc and wanted to try something as simple as possible. He was right when he said it probably wasn’t the best course of action to take in my situation and it caused more issues for me. Then we moved to injectables and timed intercourse which failed the first time but worked more in harmony with my body and again he was correct 100% on which drug protocol to use despite me asking about trying other drugs and him assuring me that his choice would be best for me. My 2nd round of injectables we tried IUI and I got pregnant. He put me on an estrogen patch for 5 days to increase my follicle count and it worked. He followed my follicles very carefully and didn’t have me trigger too early, he adjusted my medicines daily as needed and as a result he got 4 eggs and all of them made it to 5 day blastocyst. Our protocol has been shaped mainly by past failures and though our work with Dr. Wang. We use a combination of low-stims and estrogen priming, plus hGH. Dr Dicken added a few tweaks to that protocol for poor responders (like a dual trigger, for example). I liked that she had poor responder data and observations to back up her protocol tweaks. After 2 miscarriages at ~8 weeks while at another clinic, Dr. T added Lovenox and intralipids to my cycle medications. My previous clinic did not prescribe these. I was 27 during my 1st cycle, my husband was 45, and our issue becoming pregnant was likely male-factor though it also seemed that I had an issue maintaining pregnancy beyond 8 weeks.I have DOR and we attempted to bank embryos and she usually stuck to the same protocol of low dose folistim and 1 vial of menopur but at my urging we did add other things into my protocol.  I urged her to raise my dose once and she finally complied and it was a mistake and ended up a canceled cycle but I’m glad we at least tried. I have DOR so he did not want to use BC for priming since it would suppress my eggs. He had me on Estrogen patches before my cycle started, then Gonal F and Menapur. He added another injectable to prevent early ovulation around D11. He then had me go in every couple of days and adjusted my dosage according to the  results. he added HGH during my 2nd cycle which got cancelled due to a lead follicle.I had exhausted my covered IVF cycles and prescriptions and was limited to paying out of pocket for all drugs but had unlimited covered IUI cycles. She prescribed letrazole for low side-effect follicle stimulation, which I responded well to, producing 3-6 follicles for each of 5 cycles, the third resulting in a chemical pregnancy. Around that time, she suggested injectables would produce more eggs, if I could afford it. After two more negative cycles, I felt I was ready to try the more aggressive injectables. She gave me the choice of Menopur or Gonal-F, giving me a timeline and estimated number of doses, saying the output would be about the same. She did not indicate that the number of doses could go much higher, based on how my body responded, but it did, by five days, the follicles needing more time to grow than anticipated. I might have made a different choice had I known, but when it happened, I couldn't just scrap the cycle and while I did incur some unforeseen debt, she helped me out with a box of Menopur they had on hand at the clinic. This made a big difference to me both in how much I had to pay and struck me as a caring, humane gesture that certainly she didn't have to make. It was worth it, though, since that sixth cycle has ended up in a viable pregnancy!For my current cycle, Dr. Wang suggested I lower my sim doses. At my prior clinic I was on very high doses, but Dr.Wang felt that lower doses would be just as effective. I was on Gonal, Menopur, Omnitrope, and also Predisone. I also did a double trigger for egg retrieval. Micro-dose lupron with Follitism and hgh - 1st cycle cancelled due to only 4 follicles growing.  2nd cycle - retrieved 4 eggs.
Antagonist with follistim and hgh - 1st cycle cancelled due to low response.  2nd cycle - 5 eggs retrieved.
Micro-dose lupron with Follitism, hgh, letrezole - 7 eggs retrieved.For the first two FET rounds:
Crinone
Estrace 
Prednisone (slightly elevated NK levels) 
Lovenox (for slightly elevated anticardiolipin) 
Intralipids (slightly elevated NK levels)

For third, I switched to PIO thinking maybe it was affecting implantation, skipped prednisone and intralipids and waited on the lovenox until a positive beta. This transfer worked, and so far so good. I was on Gonal-F, Menopur, and Cetrotide. My follicles grew slowly so I had a long stimming cycle and adjustments were made throughout. Gonal-F started at 300 but increased to 350. Menopur started at 75 and increased to 150. Jeff is really good with cases of poor responders (aka diminished ovarian reserve). Our first attempt with him I responded too quickly and unevenly so we cancelled, and the second time around we adjusted a few things and everything went much more smoothly. It was my 9th and 10th attempt overall and Jeff really studied all of my prior cycles so that he knew what had worked and not worked in the past.  Round 1 : standard protocol - menopur, gonal f, ganirellex -- cycle cancelled due to too few follicles, converted to iui

Diminished reserve diagnosis 
Round 2 : birth control pills, ganirellex to start - menopur, gonal f -- cycle cancelled. Low follicle count. 

Round 3 : birth control pills, gonal f, menopur, ganirellex, trigger shot -- 5 follicles retrieved, 4 fertilized, no blasts 

Round 4: similar to round 3, 4 follicles, converted to iui

Round 5: similar to round 3 & 4, introduced steroid for inflammation; cancelled around day 5. Few follicles. 

Moved to donor embryos 
EFT test - revealed high levels of cyclin E consistent with possible endometriosis-- referred to surgeon for endo excision and immune panel  In 2016, I had an egg retrieval.  The medication used was as follows:  Lupron 10 units, Ganirelix 250 mcg, Gonal F 225 units, Menopur 75 units and Trigger Shot 10,000 IU.  I had 13 eggs retrieved, 10 matured and fertilized and 7 embryos were frozen.  I did not do any PGS testing during this first egg retrieval.  In the same year, I did two frozen transfers.  I transferred 2 embryos the first time and 1 embryo the second time and got negative results on both occasions.  I then decided to unfreeze and biopsy (PGS testing) the 4 remaining embryos and they all came back abnormal (chromosomes).  I then decided to discard those abnormal embryos and not transfer them.  In 2017, I had another egg retrieval.  The medication used was as follows:  Lupron 10 units, Ganirelix 250 mcg, Gonal F 225 units, Menopur 75 units and Trigger Shot 10,000 IU.  I had 12 eggs retrieved and 6 embryos were frozen.  I sent all the embryos for biopsy and PGS testing.  They all came back abnormal.  

After discussions with Dr. Tortoriello and going over my PGS results, I decided to go the donor egg route as my egg quality was not resulting in normal embryos to transfer.  In my case, my egg donor was my sister.  It resulted in us having 2 normal PGS tested embryos.  I transferred one of those embryos and got a positive pregnancy and a live birth.  He is currently 7 months old.  

Estrogen priming antagonist protocol with icsi. Embryo banking till we got enough embies to transfer. We did an estrogen priming protocol that incorporated omnitrope (growth hormone). We were planning to do a fresh transfer but I had fluid in my uterus so we had to freeze and then do a frozen transfer. I had fluid in my uterus with my previous doctors but they downplayed it and both prior transfers with them failed. So Dr. Tortoriello was the first to acknowledge this and correct for it.When we first came to see Dr. Dicken, we were trying IVF using our own eggs. We knew the odds were against us - and Dr. Dicken was clear with us about the statistics - but we were not ready to give up. Dr. Dicken led us through two cycles and made some adjustments to the process. After two IVF cycles, we decided to use an egg donor. The first transfer was not successful, and Dr. Dicken again made some adjustments to the treatment. The second time it worked. I was on menapur, gonal f, and ganirelix. My hormones were high leading up to my egg retrieval so he changed my trigger shot from hcg to Lupron. Afterwards I took a prescription to lower hormones along with ganirelex Doctor Wang used a low dose approach for me on mostly all of my cycles.  Low dose of the stimulating drugs.  
For my first few retrievals we did microdose lupin and that worked with my first cycle with doctor Wang and I retrieved 5 eggs and transferred 4 on day three however the result was a chemical pregnancy.  
We used no more than 300 units of gonal f for the days that I stimulated.  The doctor suggested low doses because i did not make a lot of eggs and the few I did make we didn't want to fry them.  Ganirelex worked best for me as when I continued to use MDL i would ovulate.  We decided to do embryo banking in hopes to have multiple children. We also felt that I would benefit from a lower dose in hopes to get better quality eggs. 
first attempt at IVF - Estrogen prime (EPP) 225 gonal f - canceled poor response and converted to IUI.
IVF 1 - EPP, 225 gonal f, 150 menopur - 6 eggs/3 blasts (freeze all)
IVF 2 - EPP, 225 gonal f, 150 menopur - 3 eggs/1 blast (freeze all)

We did IUIs with no medications that all failed. We moved on 5 IVF cycles that were also unsuccessful unfortunately. I was on letrozole, estrace, and Crinone for my frozen cycles. I was on gonal f, cetrotide, menopur and HCG for my fresh transfer cycles following retrieval.We were IUI patients. I believe I took follistim and the ovidrel for a trigger shot. I also tested for having elevated natural killer cells (NK) that could have been causing miscarriages so after the insemination I took steroids-- about 10mg/day of prednisone-- to help combat that.Dr. Dicken individualized my protocols and changed them as necessary based on my response and test results. I've done both natural and medicated transfer cycles. She added supplements and anticoagulants based on immune and clotting test results. She used protocols with letrozole and lupron to address my ongoing receptivity problems and abnormal uterine biopsy results. I got better results each cycle and finally was successful.He recommended the Yale EFT test to test for silent endo and then a 3 month course of lupron depot - I believe it helped me to be successful ultimately.  He also was able to retrieve the most eggs from me (21 each time).  Previous docs got at most 8.  His stim method is slow and patient so it took a while but paid off.  Estrogen primed microdose lupron Progesterone, estradiol (to induce ovulation), Intralipids (to address natural killer cells), steroids (to address inflammation, Folgard (to address vitamin B deficiencies)After not getting my period for 6 months I was prescribed three cycles of clomid by my OBGYN.  After not getting pregnant i went to Dr. Wang, who immediately diagnosed me with PCOS.  I went on to do three cycles of letrozole, and got pregnant on the third cycle with an injection to induce ovulation once the follicles were mature.Dr. Dicken monitored my results closely throughout the process and adjusted my protocol, as needed. Unlike my previous clinic, she was open to estrogen priming and allowed me to use the patch when the pill caused nausea. Estrogen priming (although not primed for long enough)
225 Gonal F, 75 menopur, ganirelix
16 day stim cycle because my follicles were many different sizesWe failed to implant after transferring 3 nearly perfect looking day 3 embyros so he recommended doing the Yale EFT test.  My results came back abnormal so we did the lupron depot 3 month suppression to help suppress my estrogen and essentially give the uterine lining a break and chance to ""reset.""  We banked for two cycles before starting the lupron though, b/c with my DOR, there was a chance it would be hard to cycle afterwards and also b/c we wanted to make sure I could make blasts before undergoing the depot treatment.  We then went straight into frozen transfer after the suppression phase was over and had a chemical; our first time implanting. We'll continue with more transfers. He recommended a mid amount of medication for my poor egg quality and dimished ovarian resserve.  He didn't change anything during monitoring.  I only got 1 PGS embryo but I guess egg quality was a little worse than expected.  He recommended ICSI and DNA sperm fragmentation for my husband because of low morphology.1 IVF - Gonal F (150) / Menopur (75) / Omnitrope protocol. Day 5 of monitoring showed only 3 follicles. Decision to convert to IUI cycle due to low response. - IUI not successful. 

Diagnosis - diminished ovarian reserve 

2 IVF - Estace pre-cycle // Letrazole / Gonal F (150) - ""estrogen primed cycle"" - introduced Menopur later in the cycle. Ganirellex. Trigger shot. 5 follicles retrieved. 3 fertilized (donor sperm) // 1 arrested at day 3 // 2 arrested at day 5. None made it for PGS testing. 

3 IVF - about to begin // will use Ganirellex prior to cycle day 1 in hopes of getting more even growth across follicles. For my 5th IVF and first with Dr. Wang, he recommended estrogen priming with a lower dose stim protocol for me with my DOR. We also tried HGH. He said HGH will help 20-30% of people get better eggs, so it is worth a try. From that we got 10 eggs - more than ever retrieved, and 4 fertilized - more than I ever had fertilize. Unfortunately the quality was the same as all my other tries - highly fragmented and only 3-4 cells. So the HGH didn't help me in my case but I'm glad we tried. He tested my husband for DNA fragmentation to see if that could be a reason for poor embryo growth (he was normal). He also recommended I get an EFT test, which showed I had receptivity issues. From there he recommended I get a laparoscopy to see whether I might have endometriosis, which could potentially cause the receptivity issues. Sure enough, they found the endometriosis during the lap, which was removed. Knowing this, he may have discovered why we've had such trouble all along - no other doctor suggested looking into whether I had endometriosis. So now we are going to try a new protocol to tackle that somewhat and hope we get different results.I have endometriosis so approximately six weeks before my most successful cycle, I had my second laparoscopic excision. The month prior to the cycle, I primed with HGH (Omnitrope), BCP, and Femara.  During the cycle, I used Gonal-F (low dose), HGH, and added low dose HCG at the end.  I triggered with Lupron.  I also did a two day transfer of embryos as my history suggests my body is a better place then the lab for our embryos to grow.  I typically produce many eggs but struggle to make blastocysts.  With this cycle, I produced about 17 eggs.  We transferred five day-two embryos and froze five blastocysts (combination of day 5 & 6).  I did an antagonist protocol. I did a week of estrogen priming in hopes of creating good quality, uniform eggs. I did FSH only to start then added menopur. I did about 14 days (longer than originally expected) of stims to create as many follicles as possible. We also did ICSI and PGS. She also had me take a lot of supplements and antioxidants - CoQ10, Fertilaid, Vitamin C, D, Red wine extract.I was doing an IVF transfer with a PGS'ed 5 day blastocyst. I did the usual drug protocol I'd done at another clinic, but I also did intralipid infusions every 2-3 weeks starting before the transfer and then through the beginning of the pregnancy. SIRM does this treatment for people who've has recurrent, unexplained miscarriages like me in the past. I did not do a lot of medicine as my egg count is low. The first time I used a pill with gonal-F 150. The second time I did no pills but increased gonal to 250 I think.  Over  2 cycles i made 2 blasts. i transferred one frozen blast and that took!150 of Menopur.  Trigger shot of Ovidrel.  Only one follicle.  In the two week wait. We used clomid to help with the folicals. I was on a low stimulation plan since my ovarian reserve was still good for my age (38 at the time of treatment). I was a case of unexplained infertility so I didn't have any known issues apart from being Vitamin D insufficient which Dr. Dicken found out in preliminary tests. I also did a genetic test as recommended by Dr. Dicken. The test revealed that I have a MTFHR Mutation, so Dr. Dicken prescribed me extra Folate.  Overall, I didn't encounter any problems with the medication. I felt that her treatment plan was excellent. For my IUI cycle, I saw Dr. Dicken for all monitoring appointments.  She prescribed me Clomid, and then Ovidrel.  My husband's counts had been all over the place, and the sample for the IUI wasn't ideal, but it was successful! Dr. Dicken timed it perfectly, and it resulted in a healthy full-term pregnancy.We did a natural, frozen embryo cycle. He had me on 2 weeks of antibiotics during the first part of my cycle since I had been questioning infection. In addition, 5mg of prednisone and Foltanx. After the transfer, I supplemented with PIO and estrogen.Letrozole to stimulate earlier ovulation, before degradation of egg begins.
Aspirin during conception and blood thinners after conception to prevent clots, after genetic testing revealed predisposition to clotting.
High dose folic acid after genetic testing revealed mutation affecting folate levels.
High dose omega 3 after natural killer assay was slightly elevated.
I used the Gonal-F/Menopur protocol with Ganirelix.  My protocol was always tailored and adjusted for each cycle based on my needs and response.  An endometrial function test revealed I would benefit from 3 months of Lupron treatment.  I then required IVIG (when Intralipid treatment did not work), Prednisone, and other immune related drugs.
After adjusting this protocol, I was able to finally become pregnant.Standard hormone injections for egg retrieval, Lupron treatment for slightly abnormal lining, and cleaning out of uterine fibroids. The Lupron treatment normalized my lining to produce a successful pregnancy. Dr Wang used the estrogen priming with Lupron about a week before my cycle started. When my cycle started in Day three we continued on with Lupron x2 daily, Follistim at 225, HGH and then added a low dose HGH mid way through. It was a long stunning cycle but we were able to retrieve 6, fertilize 4, and then transfer 3 which has been my best results to date.I had a low egg reserve so a lot of my treatment was smoking up the eggs I had. She measured my hormone levels and gave me hormones in response. We used my eggs and my wife carried.  Neither of us had any known fertility issues.  Due to the way we wanted to have our child, IVF was the clear path.  Dr. Dicken gave us options of a fresh transfer or a 5 day embryo, we chose the latter.  Each process was clearly explained and we made the decision based on our preferred timeline.  Felt 100% confident and very well educatedDifficult to answer. I have a specific genetic disorder so the protocol was pretty standard (sorry I can't remember all the meds) - I had to get pgs on any embryos created. We had a good protocol to begin with during cycle 1, it was disastrous during cycle 2, so we changed it and found one that worked which produced 1-2 good embryos each cycle - which is the best we could have hoped for.She ultimately gave me the same treatment for the IVF  as the past doctors. She used a lupron protocol. However, we did a genetic test on the embyos so we had to continue with a frozen cycle. Because the endometrial function test showed some slight abnormatlities ( a test debated by many) - she put me on lupron depot. This was followed by an FET cycle - one embryo out of 5 tested was deemed good - and we transfered it. I was put on nightly injections of progesterone and delestrogen. Ultimately the cycle failed.My successful cycle we transferred my lonely 2 embryos on Day 2 and I have my 1 year old son from that fresh D2 transfer.
We used HGH as my quality was really bad especially after termination my first pregnancy with Dr. Wang due to a developmental issue with the baby. 
So we used everything we knew about .My 2nd IVF cycle we used a treatment where we quieted down the endometriosis I had. I was given 1 shot every month for 3 months so that my eggs could grow without the endo interfering with their growth. I think this was a key factor in my ability to get pregnant in my 2nd IVF cycle. My first IVF we used gonal F in varying amounts, menopur, and ganirelix and triggered with HCG. This resulted in 36 eggs, 22 embryos, and they all arrested by day 3. I also had slight OHSS from this cycle. I did another IVF with him and we changed the protocol. I was on BCP for 3 weeks before stims, lupron, gonal F, menopur, and ganirelix. We had 36 eggs, 22 embryos and transferred 2 embryos on day 3 since the dr called saying all the embryos weren't looking good. I ended up with a chemical pregnancy and had VERY bad hyperstimulation and was bedridden for a few weeks. This doctor believed that maybe my husbands balanced translocation caused this (later we tested some of the dead embryos and they were normal so this was not the reason) or that my embryos did not like their lab.  He also suggested doing a day 1 or 2 transfer. Ultimately he suggested trying RMA since their lab protocol is difference there.We dealt with severe MFI, so he coordinated with my husband's urologist to time my egg retrieval with his surgery.  He monitored me closely to keep my on schedule, and it worked perfectly.  He retrieved a significant amount of eggs, and his amazing embyrologist spent 9 hours, until late in the evening, going through the surgical samples to inject the sperm into my eggs.  After our fresh transfer resulted in a negative test, he suggested some tests just to be safe (since the frozen embryos were my husband's only chance for a biological child).  He did an endometrial function test, and found an issue.  I did 3 months of depot lupron to reset my system, and then prepared for an FET.  That FET was successful.  His treatment was such that, even if it hadn't worked, I never would have wondered ""what if,"" which was a huge gift.Standard cycle medications and treatment were used though the ONLY success we had was after doing FROZEN transfers BOTH times. The second time my wife was given hormones to shut her reproductive system down for 3 months prior to the frozen transfer to get her ready and it worked--- A little too well it turns out.Don't really remember. Seemed to include ganerelix and some other shot for ovulation and the usual trigger injection, progesterone etc at the beginning. Nothing all that unusualI don't remember all of the exact treatment strategies used, however, I do think Dr. T was conservative in administering hormones (in a good way) so I wasn't overstimulated. I had heard horror stories from other clinics and felt fortunate to definitely avoid that experience. Menopur & Follistim. I started late on a cycle & asked if I should instead start the next month because I was already showing a lead follicle. He said no, start meds, big surprise, lead follicle the whole cycle. Wasted time & money when we should’ve just waited.I have endometriosis and my first IVF cycle the clinic would only do a 5 day blastocyst transfer and none of my embryos made it to 5 days. She thinks endo can make it harder for them to last til 5 in the lab so wanted to try a day 3 freeze. My first IVF I also had a split cohort of eggs growing at different rates. Because of this, she chose not to start me on BCP, but instead a week of estrogen priming, then 225 gonal f and 75 mg menopur. She also let me try Human Growth Hormone for 5 days, which my former clinic refused to do. Ganirelix the last few days. My eggs all grew at the same rate this time, meaning we could retrieve almost all. injectible drugs before the egg retrieval. Gonal F 225. Given my relatively young age at the time (30) and no egg quality or quantity factors, he selected a not aggressive stem process that left me with little to no side effects and success on the first try.Since I have a good ovarian reserve the Antagonist protocol was used. Three IUIs, each with increasing levels of ovulation monitoring and ovulation-producing medication. Then two transfers of privately donated embryos, under anesthesia. Antagonist protocol, 3 day transfer, all to freeze.He used estrogen patches and then stimulation medication. Lower dosages than before. Felt much less bloaty. He triggered me a bit later I think. I got the same egg number but made 2 blastocytes.  He implanted both on day 5 and one made my daughter!Estrogen priming to synchronize follicles then microdose Lupron, Gonal F and menopur and Omnitrope. Produced better results in terms of quality of the eggs.We did pretty straight forward antagonist cycles, the difference for us was using autoimmune meds during our last transfer and transferring a larger number of day 2 embryos, rather than waiting to make blasts.  I firmly believe we would not have been successful without this early transfer protocol which Dr. Wang carefully put together for us.  For UIU, we switched from clomid to letrozole because it was better for my lining. The first round of IVF we used birth control but after we canceled that round we left our birth control because I was a slow responder. 1st attempt - Follistim (600) , menapur and generelix and HCG trigger - 6 eggs, 5 fertilized, 5 made it to Day 3. Transferred 3 at Day 3 other 2 did not make it to Day5. negative pregnancy test
2nd attempt - Natural IVF attemp with lower meds, Follistim (350), menapur and ganerelix - 2 eggs retrieved, both fertilized. Did not make it past day 4. - no transfer
3rd attempt - Lupron used this time. for 7 days. Follistim (600), menapur and ganerelix - 5 eggs, only 1 fertilized. - Scans showed 9 follicles measuring between 18 -20 but only 5 mature, only 1 fertilized. - transferred the 1 embryo on Day 3 - awaiting results. I was on gonal-f, menopur, cetrotide, Saizon, prednisone, baby aspirin, lovenox. IUI with injectables - chemical pregnancy
Fresh cycle - antagonist protocol - negative but produced 3 frozen embryos that worked as a FET 3 years later (produced identical twins)
Fresh Cycle 2- long lupron - produced fewer eggs but thought that the quality might be better - did a 3 day emergency transfer when all but 3 arrested at day 2 - produced a wonderful amazing baby girl  We used Clomid then injectables for PCOS, and then used IUI to help with sperm morphology issuesI did antagonists cycle with medium dose of meds.  He normally doesn't like to go over 300 units of meds.  He uses LH later on in the cycle.Dr. Wang provided the risks and complications that I'd experience in the treatment and he walked me through every step. The result was GOOD!I first went through blood work and for an HSG test with a radiologist.  The doctor she recommended was outstanding.

I then took oralmedications and injections to prepare for egg retrieval.

On the 3rd try I became pregnant.

She was there every step of the way!I did an estrogen patch before stimulation and then did 11 days of gonal and menopur. I also did femara pills for a few days. Femara was supposed to be for endometriosis as I had it diagnosed 2 years ago with a laporoscopy.Can't remember the details but I know the blastocyte was transferred on day 5
We did Femara IUI. I am an SMC and didn’t have any proven infertility at the time, so we started slow. I had one cycle cancelled because my estrogen was low. Two actual IUIs, both negative. This is hard to remember - it was 2015.  He did use intralipids (sp?) infusions which I think helped to keep the pregnancy as I have an autoimmune disorder. I used birth control and estrogen to prepare for embryo transfer and then began progesterone as well. Letrozol and timed sex (3X)
Letrozol and IUI
Clomid and IUIPICSI was added for male factor infertility (sperm fragmentation) and this got us 2.5 more embryos than any prior cycle. Only did 3 rounds of IUI with progesterone support.  1 chemical pregnancy.Used estrogen priming for DOR.  Used HGH, viagra suppositories, and stims for thin lining Currently I am doing Lupron flare protocol. It resulted in one dominant follicle. We canceled cycle.Letrozole, trigger shot & timed intercourse. Estrogen priming with high dose Antagonist. I also did intralipid therapy and immune therapy that seemed to help tremendously.I cannot remember all of the medications we usedCary did some very specific blood work for me that detected an elevated prolactin level, which may have been contributing to implantation problems.  Along with prescribing a medicine for that, she also sent me for an MRI to make sure there wasn't something more serious causing that- very thorough. I was on low dose of injections for egg banking.  He used low dose meds bc I have DOR.  He recommended banking for 3 cycles and then testing.Don't remember, there were so many medicines. Estrogen Priming protocol for Egg retrieval
Depot Lupron shot before embryo transfer which was main reason for my success
I have low ovarian reserve so Dr. T started me on a low dose birth control fir a longer period of time. After that, we did menapur and gonal to stimulate the follicals. I was closely monitored throughout to ensure they were growing routinely. When we had 4-5 (I did get 20+ like some women) we did a retrieval. I did 2 rounds to get as many eggs as possible, and ended up with 4, 5 day blastos. Letrezole, Ovidrel, IUIWe did ultra sounds, blood, fertility drugs for a week and antibiotics, trigger shot , lots of monitoring. Treatment for poor egg quality, banking cycles, Cgh embryo testing, treatment for implantation failure (3-4mo Lupron depot) prednisone and ivig/intralipid infusions. I had it all!When I came to Dr. Tortoriello, I had one embryo from my previous doctor. We tried to implant, but it failed. We were not surprised since Dr. Tortoriello advised that the medications prescribed by my previous doctor actually lowered my egg quality and count.  Thereafter, we did a egg retrieval and tested two embryos using PGD. We were able to transfer one embryo which successfully implanted. I gave birth to a healthy baby girl in April 2019.After we had a negative pregnancy, Dr. T gave us a different medication plan. Basically we tried different medications (e.g. baby Aspirin, Letrozole, Cetrotide, etc.) in the last transfer cycle. I believe the adjustment he made in the medication plan of the last cycle contributed a lot to conceiving.     As our infertility was unexplained, we started with IUI which unfortunately did not work. After a few tries we moved to IVF which worked perfectly. Sadly we had a miscarriage and later discovered it would be due to autoimmune problems.Dr. Tortoriello was going to put me on 50mg of Clomid.  I suggested we increase that to 100mg since that's the dosage the previous doctor had given me which resulted in a positive pregnancy test.  He listened and increased the doseage.  I appreciated that.  It led to my successful pregnancy!Menopur and Gonal injections for egg retrieval— progesterone / estrogen /folic acid post transfer up until 11 weeks pregnantI dont rememberShe supported egg transfer with medication/hormones which I think made all the difference. We asked Dr. T what he thought would be best for us and our situation. He would always give us his expert suggestions but ultimately try to let us decide how many we wanted transferred as long as it was safe. Based on my age we would transfer no more than two. Dr. T described what he thought would be best approach for the transfer and given my age expected outcomes. I always felt that I was making an educated decisionDr. T only transferred two eggs as max number. Actually, he wanted to transfer only one because he cared about me who lost identical twins before, but I pushed him to transfer two eggs, and he did it for me. I don't recall what Dr. T had to say about multiple transfer - I was never going to do more than single embryo transfer and it was never an issue since I only had one normal embryo post-PGSAs long as my doctor is willing to do eSET, I think that's up to the patient; I never wanted it so it never came up, but I'm pretty sure Dr. Tortoriello would do it if that was what I wanted--it's my body/money/willingness to risk or reduce a multiple pregnancy!Unfortunately, we did not have the luxury of having the availability of multiple embryos. Therefore, this question is moot Dr. Wang educated me on eSET vs multiple embryo transfer not once but each time before the decision needed to be made.  He left the decision to me and my husband. He was NOT preferring one over the other.  Dr. Wang would not transfer more than 2. Two embryos were transferred each of the two IVF cycles.  My age was a factor. I believe Dr. T preferred single transfer to avoid multiples. I didn't have that option so it wasn't an issue for us. Two embryos were transferred, one was successful. We were asked about the choice b/w eSET v. Multiple and chose eSET. My husband and I always thought we wanted to transfer 2 embryos when the time came.   Dr T walked us through the benefits and risk factors that 2 could possibly bring onto myself and  the embryos.  I’m a very small at 5ft 110lbs and his option really matters to us.  We decided on 1 embryo transfer for the best possible outcomeDr. Dicken recommends transferring two past the age of 35, though she is more cautious with PGS-tested normal embryos and the last time we spoke, indicated that it was ultimately up to us. We will most likely transfer the PGS normal embryo along with the inconclusive embryo at the same time, because that (according to her) gives us the highest chance of a single live birth. Overall, she is a good combination of realistic but cautious.I only had one viable embryo to transfer.  He let me make the decisions. After I had my first son Dr. T recommended eSET for subsequent transfers due to my age and success getting pregnant with previous transfers.Dr Wang approved transferring 3 embryos due to my age and embryo quality.  Otherwise, I'm not sure if he has strong feelings to doing eSET vs multiple in other circumstances.He was very open and asked my preference. Because I said single without hesitating, we didn't discuss it further We have not yet transferred. We have only done retrievals with freezing. I believe that he assesses these things on a case by case basis. We transferred 2 as I was 44 at time of transfer. Ultimately one stuck and I am nursing her as I type!Dr. Tortoriello told me that twins were a high risk pregnancy so we opted to transfer just one blast and it took!My doctor preferred using multiple embryos because of my age.  I would not transfer more than 2 embryos in the futureWe did not do any transfersGiven our horrible quality (never making a blast) and my insistence I was not doing IVF again (I had insurance coverage but emotionally could not handle it), and our saying we'd prefer twins to zero kids, we were aggressive. we transferred 4 day 3 embryos. We ended up with twins born healthy at 38 weeks We were extremely disappointed that she wasn't direct about the pros and cons of day 3/day 5 transfer.  Also, had I known my embryos would arrest on day 3 I would have opted for this option. Since the embryologists do not check the embryos on day 2 there is no option for day 3 transfer if you opt for day 5.We told him we were very against twins so he didn't recommend iui or clomid.  So he knows we would never transfer more than one embryo.For my poor embryos, I think we would have transferred 2. But mine didn't develop well enough to have that conversation.Dr. Wang made his decision about the number of embryos to transfer based on my history and past cycles.  Other doctors would have only allowed one embryo given my age.   I believe she prefers single embryo transfers - after PGS tested - for best resultsDr. Dicken suggested we transfer only one embryo rather than the two we had to choose from b/c of my history of miscarriages. We did not do IVF, but Dr. Dicken carefully monitored my follicles before IUI, so as not to risk multiple pregnancies.He based my transfer on my individual history (many prior failed transfers) and the grading of my embryos which I greatly appreciated. I think this is his approach with all his patients. No, I have DOR and am now 44, so I understand transferring a few embryos gives me better odds.Dr. T was very firm to transfer a single embryo each time given my younger age.They will transfer 3 for my age group.Given my age (30) and quality of eggs, he recommended eSET unless we were ok with multiples. i agreed with this approach.Dr. Dicken did have a preference to transfer the least number of embryos.He offered to implant one, but I wanted both, and he said it was all right as I was nearly 40.We transferred a larger number untested embryos which led to success after failed single and double transfers of pgd tested embryos.  He said 2-3 based on my ageI only had one blastocyst by day 5, and it took.  But if I had another he said he still prefers one at a time.Cary Dicken advised me to transfer a single embryo because of my history. I lost an 18 weeks twin pregnancy the previous year and suggested it was better not to risk a multiple pregnancy
No comments NoWe would transfer 2-3 if I had that many.We just decided to test the embryos for genetic problems and then transfer the best looking one. We didn't want to put too much stress on the body. We also only had 4 embryos and didn't want to lose two in one shot in case it didn't work.N/aI would definitely recommend doing more then one I did two and sadly lost one and thank goodness I did that or I wouldn’t have my daughter I was aligned with Dr T in that I preferred eSET. After such a long infertility journey, the last thing I wanted was a high risk multiples pregnancy! With a frozen embryo transfer and genetic testing Dr Dicken advised the chances of success were high enough only one embryo was needed and we had success!Dr. Dicken counsels each patient on this individually. We transferred 2 embryos since my egg quality is poor.  It also costs me a lot to transfer each time so I liked that he was willing to transfer 2.Dr. Wang will support eSET or multiple.  He encouraged us to try multiple embryo transfers given my past history of poor implantation. I had 2 blasts and he recommended one at a time. Good advice as it took !We only had two embryos worth transferring. Given my age Dr. Dicken would have let us decide if two or three embryos were going to be transferred if we had enough.We transferred both eggs because of my low numbers and age. Dr T recommendation was always to go with eSET,  but i went with multiple transfer but he explained the risk involved beforehand. ",9.0,8.300000000000008,"I remember all of this, but I did too many cycles to be extremely specific here. He followed my follicles very carefully and didn’t have me trigger too early, he adjusted my medicines daily as needed and as a result he got 4 eggs and all of them made it to 5 day blastocyst. I had 12 eggs retrieved and 6 embryos were frozen. I was on letrozole, estrace, and Crinone for my frozen cycles. Estrogen primed microdose lupron Progesterone, estradiol (to induce ovulation), Intralipids (to address natural killer cells), steroids (to address inflammation, Folgard (to address vitamin B deficiencies)After not getting my period for 6 months I was prescribed three cycles of clomid by my OBGYN. We ended up with twins born healthy at 38 weeks We were extremely disappointed that she wasn't direct about the pros and cons of day 3/day 5 transfer. Since the embryologists do not check the embryos on day 2 there is no option for day 3 transfer if you opt for day 5.We told him we were very against twins so he didn't recommend iui or clomid. We transferred both eggs because of my low numbers and age."
47,Sher Fertility of New York,cost,"I was very pleased to find out that Dr. Tortoriello took my insurance and that he participates in many insurances. He tries very hard to work with his patients' comfort level.Cycle mostly covered by insurance. About $5000 out of pocket for medications, co-pay and non-covered testsMonitoring (each visit) $525
Egg retrieval $2400
ICSI $2400
PICSI $1000
Embryo culture $1500
Extended culture $1500
PGD biopsy $500 per embryo
Cryo $1000
Storage $80
FET - ? haven't seen the bill yetI've tried to block it out, but it was commensurate with other equivalent clinics in NYC and slightly cheaper than a couple of the others I considered at the timeThe cost of the cycle (hormonal pre-retrieval therapy, egg retrieval, ICSI, pre-implantation hormonal therapy, PGS/PGD, fertilization, implantation) ran close to $20,000Luckily we had insurance coverage so I'm not sure about OOP cycle costs. first go round - no insurance - did a 3 cycle package for about 23k (not counting copays for bloodwork and meds)
second go round - FET- had insurance - i think i paid maybe 200 out of pocket for copaysLuckily our treatments were covered by my health insurance. Unfortunately we maxed out.They are covered for the most part by insurance. 10-13K + meds$40-50 copay for each visit (including ultrasounds, HSG and IUI, $200 bloodwork Around 11k for IVF, 1000 for PICSI, 3600 I think for FET.She luckily accepted my insurance. Mostly covered by my insurance. But we had to pay 20% out of pocket. Came to around $3000 per cycle.$50 to reserve consultation (can be applied to treatment), $50 for sperm analysis, $815 payable directly to Recepitva for endometrial biopsy testing for endometriosis.   Other costs were covered by insurance.$5,000 per cycle with insurance. I don’t remember. It was covered under my insurance plan. Very reasonable costa always as they work with insurancesMy insurance is AMAZING I’ll I paid for was my deductible - which was to cover the IVF meds.  No other out of pockets payments at allWe had two cycles covered by insurance. The next will be self pay. The first two cycles came out to about 5K each including the cost of PGS testing and co-pays. They have quoted the self pay cycle at about 12K.We have coverage through my husband's employer.Fortunately, my insurance covered a large portion of treatments.  IUIs were covered; i had $50 co-pays every time I went for an appointment.  IVF was 75% covered so I had a co-pay prior to treatment.  Same for the transfer.  I had to pay for medications.I only had co-pay each visit and co insurance until I met my deductible. 14,000k for IVF cycle, $3800 for frozen embryo transfer I was covered by insurance up to $25,000. PICSI  cost $1000 even if it was just 2 eggs retrieved.  Consults were $50.   Most of my other costs I was lucky enough to have covered by insurance. $50 copay each visit--30 for seeing the doctor, 20 for labs whether I had them done or not. I was billed later for fees. I ended up spending an average of $800 a month at the clinic and on associated out-of-pocket drug costs (I used Kings in Brooklyn) for IUI cycles using letrozole. I did not investigate discount online fertility pharmacies, and I wish I had. I believe my treatment was approximately $7,000 with my insurance. $9950 freeze all cycle - if monitoring not done at Sher.  
$3820 - FET (does not include monitoring. I'm a remote patient)
$1800 - PGS testing. covered up to 8 embryos over 9 months.$1540 per transfer with insurance
Plus other costs I was able to use my insurance to cover my care, although we paid for medications out-of-pocket. I had a couple of great conversations with the Financial Coordinator who practically gave me a line item budget of what everything would cost, what insurance covered, etc. It was so very helpful to go into the process with a clear picture of what we would need to pay upfront.This clinic is costlier than other clinics. United healthcare coverage - 80/20 after $4k deductible. My care under Dr. Tortoriello was primarily covered under my husband's insurance plan.  My insurance covered 2 egg retrievals (my own egg retrievals), 2 transfers and medication associated with both egg retrievals and both transfers using my own eggs/embryos.  However, my egg donor process was paid out-of-pocket.  My out-of-pocket cost for my egg donor process plus transferring the embryo was approximately $22K (including egg retrieval of egg donor, medication for her, anesthesia for her, my transfer and my medication).  I don’t remember actual prices as my insurance covered almost everything No issues...was out of pocket.We compared facilities and found that costs at SHER were about average. I had Cigna so they covered most after I met my deductible. The prescription medicine was an expense I didn’t budget. Cigna covered it but I had to pay a copay and that was 1kMy insurance paid for two cycles with the doctor, but the times i paid cash it was extremely expensive.Insurance covered IUIs, partial IVF I do not recall; they participated in my insurance at the time so we only had copays.Luckily, my insurance covered the majority of my costs. I chose to do a few more experimental tests that weren't covered by insurance, but they weren't pushed on me and the costs were made clear upfront. I've had a few errors on my bills, but they've been cleared up pretty easily. The biggest hurdle was the initial financial consult, but everything has been fine since.i had insurance coverage but believe the cycle was about $25K (it's expensive but worth it)... we paid out of pocket for PICSI at 1000I had insurance coverage, but a high copay for the sonograms.14.5 K and 5 K for medicationsMy insurance paid for most of it, except retrieval anesthesia ($625) plus cost of PGS testing.  I paid copays for office visits and medications.  Calls with dr were $75 (not covered by insurance).  Injections meeting with nurse cost $100.  We had to pay co-pays on all testing.  DNA sperm fragmentation test was not covered by insurance.I have $25k Lifetime coverage through United Healthcare which Sher accepts. I gave a $1k deposit to cover all office copays at the start of my cycle. My medication is coverage through my medical insurance - minus $3k deductible. Everything was billed to my insurance - I haven't received any bills yet. We did pay ~$1,000 for various testing that was not covered by insurance.Insurance covered my IVF cycles.  Some medications used in my care were deemed experimental so I had to pay out of pocket. The first cycle was covered by our insurance. The next one we will wither choose 1 IVF with ICSI and1 FET for $13,000 (not including PGS) or two IVFs with ISCI and unlimited FETs for $26,000. Roughly. I believe the PGS was about $2,000. Freezing and boring embryos was about $80/month.My insurance covered 80% of the cost of the transfer. Some of the drugs weren't covered. I would only have to pay our copay and for the shots, which were around $300. We also had to pay for some tests.I have GHI, and my treatment was covered.  Each visit did have a $50 copay.I don't remember the exact breakdown since I still had insurance coverage at that time. However, I know it is an extremely expensive clinic. I don't remember exact costs but I had good health coverage for these issues. I do recall that Dr Dicken was careful to warn about costs that might not be covered by insurance. The clinic also offers a financial counselor to meet with you at the beginning of treatment, but because my treatments were minimal and my health coverage was good we didn't have such a meeting.I used insurance to cover egg retrievals, frozen transfers, office visits, monitoring, and blood work.  After exhausting insurance benefits,  I paid out of pocket for 1 fresh IVF cycle.  The cost for the fresh cycle was very reasonable compared to costs of other clinics.I know they offered package deals for multiple cycles, but cannot remember how much they cost. I do know that they accepted our health insurance which meant we were only responsible for 10-20% of total cost, and some uncovered things (genetic screening, additional testing, prescription copays etc)I am not sure the exact costs. But I believe the IVF was about $16,000-17,000Much of my treatment was covered by insurance but about a quarter of it was by me. Medications (and there were lots) was mostly covered, but I'm sure I spent a few thousand dollars on medication and treatment. Also, I have paid for egg freezing.I don't recall exactly because we have insurance and were near our policy out of pocket max.  Do remember thinking costs were very reasonable, inline with other practices researched, but with better care.10-15,000 per cycle all included with meds, but they do a package upgrade so that it is cheaper if you do 2nd and 3rd cycle with them.I had insurance coverage so all I had to do is keep a close eye to all the claimsMy treatment was largely covered by my insurance. I think that the overall cost of care was somewhere in the $4,000  to $7,000 dollar range per IVF cycle.We had insurance coverage, so I can't comment beyond saying that the staff was very helpful in dealing with my insurance, despite the insurance company's hard work to make things as difficult as possible.the 2 cycle plan I think was $17,000 and the 3 cycle plan I think was $21,000 the medication was very expensive but that was not at the clinicCovered by insurance. Out of pocket probably around $2000 per cycle? Covered around 10-20K/cycle?We had care under the Progeny insurance network.They were covered by my insuranceMy insurance covered it, so I had the percentage that they don't pay for, plus $400 for HGH which they don't cover, plus travel and lodging for the 5 days I had to be in NY for monitoring before egg retrieval. As well as cost for donor sperm and embryo freezing.24K plus prescriptions.I do not remember. They were comparable to other facilities in the area, but a bit lower. Mostly paid by insurance, 25 % copaymentNot much....my insurance covers me for 3 cycles.Insurance paid for most of it.I can’t remember exactly, but I think around 60k for four cycles not including genetic testing which added about 10k. However, I think rates have changed since we were there.  9k for a freeze all cycle.  11k ivf cycle w fresh transfer (with outside monitoring)I haven't received all the bills yet.Covered 100%.Clinic and medication cost about 20000 dollarsI had insurance, so I just paid copays. Unsure but over $10kI don't remember, was billed for multiple visits so can't describeAround 25k for ivfI don't rememberi was completely self pay. I did a two cycle packageOn par with other nyc clinics we researchedCovered by insurance so farCopays and anesthesiaCopaysDon't remember. We purchased a package that included free transfer until success.I had insurance that supported$1000-2000 for IUI and medication I had insurance $6500plus $500 for anesthesiologists Some though insurance some out of pocketI was covered by insurance up to $25,000. Retrieval was approximately $12,000 and transfer was approximately $4,000. All other appointments were specialist co-pays of $30.My IUI was covered.  I just had to pay for clomid which was discounted through insurance.Everything was covered under my insurance - except for some medications. The care was pricey but in line with anywhere else and definitely not the most expensive. They did offer financing though I didn’t take advantage of it. I am fortunate to finally have IVF coverage but it’s not the greatest and many thing still aren’t covered. The things we have had to pay out of pocket for are required to be paid for before cycling. SIRM is much more expensive out of pocket than other clinics we have been to. I haven't received a bill yet.I had insurance coverage20k per IVF cycle with PGS testingI had insurance for the year I did retrievals, but the out of pocket cost for FETs is 3800, not including monitoring visits. 
Just co-pays. Everything was covered.  My requirement for inseminations was waived because of our combined issues....too many to count it seemed.I don't remember the exact amounts anymore. I was on a ""cheaper"" low-stimulation plan which SHER institute doesn't offer anymore. $11,000 (+/- a few hundred) - it was so expensive that I actually did a spreadhseet. Also i had insurance cover the IVF - this was only for tests, and FET.I dealt with Jessica at billing and she was very easy to work with. We did 2 IVF egg retrievals here and one fresh transfer. We also paid to get embryos tested. My medications at the time were partially covered by insurance. I believe we spent around $30,000.UIU's at the time, out of pocket cost roughly $650, since then the entire IUI procedure now costs around $950 a cycle. Insurance paidMine were mostly covered by my insurance plan.

49,Extend Fertility,doctor,"Though there are plenty good doctors on the West Coast, there are none I found as caring and skilled as Dr. Klein.  There is nothing like the peace-of-mind and reassurance that comes with fully trusting that your doctor has your best interest in mind.   

Personally, if I had to choose between a doctor who was extremely skilled, had great success rates, professional etc. vs a doctor who is kind caring and gentle - I would opt for the former, a doctor whose expertise I can rely on completely.  But the greatest gift for me was that I didn't have to choose.   He excels in both areas. 

I was comfortable to bring up any questions that I had and always received a clear and thorough response.   He's fully present when he's with you and takes his time to explain things thoroughly.  Dr. Klein is a great communicator. As I mentioned before, it’s necessary to provide the patient with statistics; however, he never left me without hope. I had my frozen eggs fertilized and it resulted in 5 embryos. I sent it out for PGS testing with 4 coming back abnormal and 1 inconclusive. He was willing to transfer the inconclusive as that is what I wanted- which did not lead to pregnancy. I then went through an IVF cycle and he was able to retrieve 10 eggs. Again, we had 5 embryos. This time I did not want to have PGS testing done- which Dr. Klein respected. He transferred two and now I’m pregnant with twins! Dr. Guarnaccia is amazing.  He performed my medical exam as well as my egg retrieval.   He was so professional, but personable.  I felt very comfortable asking questions and he was very clear with expectations.  I truly felt like I was in great hands with Dr. Guarnaccia and I was.  After the retrieval, I had almost no pain and the procedure went very smooth.  I would highly recommend Dr. Guarnaccia to anyone considering egg retrieval.  

Dr. Maslow was great.  I met with Dr. Maslow for my initial consultation and she reached out to follow up a few days after my procedure.  It was nice to start and end with Dr. Maslow, because of the familiarity.  Also, she was very clear about expectations and had no problem answering all of my questions.  I would highly recommend Dr. Maslow to anyone considering egg retrieval. I never experienced any anxiety or questioning with Dr. Guarnaccia because anytime something would happen, i.e., unexpected spotting I would email him and get a response back immediately.  I never had to sit there wondering if something was wrong or am I doing the right thing. 

I am not an easy patient. Every Dr. visit I  would come in with a list of questions I found on forums or the internet. Dr. G patiently listened and provided detailed answers to my questions, never brushing it off or telling me to stay off the internet.  Dr. Guarnaccia is a knowledgeable and experienced doctor who is more old fashioned in the way he acts with his patients.  He answered every question with patience and understanding, and I think he gets what his patients are going through because he's done this for so many years.  Dr. G was very straightforward and detailed, which is an approach I really appreciated. I felt that he was able to express care and concern while also being direct (warmth in a doctor is not a requirement for me in treatment). I would definitely recommend Dr. G to my friends who are interested in egg freezing. She answered all of my questions, I asked about many issues concerning my case as well as research and upcoming treatments. She was very understanding, knowledgeable and accommodating. I felt very safe with her regarding my treatment and that she did everything to improve my outcome.Dr. G was alway honest and realistic during my treatment.  There were many times where my body was not responding to the course of treatment and instead of pressing me to go forward he would always give me the choice of wether I wanted to continue going forward knowing that the chances of an optimal result were low or to stop for this cycle and then try again next cycle. It made me feel good knowing he was more concerned with the result as opposed  to just completing the cycle. I had an excellent experience with Dr. Klein and Extend Fertility. Even as a low performer and a low AMH, they were able to provide affordable rates that allowed me to meet my egg banking goals. I traveled from the west coast 5 times to freeze eggs at this clicic because of the affordable and comprehensive fertility care.Dr. Maslow was extremely helpful in explaining the complicated elements of a pleasing to me.  She was easy to talk to you even when my results were not so great in the beginning stages.  She was encouraging but honest throughout the process, which I really appreciated.Dr.Klein has much experience in the field of RE and is highly regarded in the world of medicine. We chose him to assist us in our dream to become parents and are confident that will happen soon. His practice makes takes special care to understand religious and cultural restrictions  in the world of assisted reproductive technology, adjusting timing of cycles accordingly. Each time we got to be seen by Dr. Klein we felt cared for and he was generally upbeat and more than willing to answer any of our Questions or concerns. Each cycle of ours was unique and there was always an attempt to make this one the best yet. We were advised to continue with ivf after 1 year of trying various other treatments. We will be doing so soon.When you go to Extend Fertility, it feels more like you are a patient of the clinic then any patient of a specific doctor. I only met her once during a consultation and was once seen by a different doctor during the routine visits. She did not do my retrieval. She was really nice and knowledgeable and patiently answered my questions.Dr. Guarnaccia came in as a tourist to perform surgery on me.  It was the first time I saw him, ever, he was the per diem who came in to cover for my actual doctor that Saturday.  Unlucky me.  He asked me if I had any medical concerns.  This was the first bad sign.  When I said heart disease, history of fibroids, cysts and a clotting disorder, he started scrolling through his stack of papers. I was a little nervous at that point.  He also asked me who ""Jane Doe"" was and I said she works here.  I got alarmed then.  He proceeded to go to the computer to get acquainted with my record as this was not necessarily going to be a walk in the park as he had expected.  I took that moment to asked the nurse who that was.  They explained my doc who I was confident in and choose to care for me, was away for Sabbath and this was the per diem who was going to perform the surgery.  No one informed me of this ahead of time and I almost felt obliged to accept it.  All I could think of as a patient was, I don't even know him, I just meet him and he doesn't seem competent; as well as all the money, injections, time off that it took to get to that day to freeze my eggs.  I told myself it will all be fine, although I almost wanted to call my boyfriend who was sitting in the waiting room.  However, the anesthesiologist came in, he knew exactly what he was doing and I thought it would be ok.
A day after my surgery, I had intense pain at work   ( i have a high pain tolerance) and my boss sent me home. I called my actual fertility doctor who said everyone reacts differently, if pain persists come for a visit.  As far as the results, I am young with no ferlility issues whatsoever, but from the expected 12 eggs to be frozen, we only got 5.  My actual doctor admitted it was very unusual.  Unfortunately, the pain came back stronger a few weeks later. Basically, I was rushed to the ER from work - they said I had a cyst.  Went home, still in pain for a week so I went to my actual doctor and he prescribed me medications.  One more week of pain, I am rushed to the ER from my obgyn's office!  She tells me this is bad and that I might lose my ovary. I got emergency surgery as the doctors at the hospital feared me losing my ovary due to an hemorraghic cyst.  I was crushed.  They said consent to have your ovary removed and I just felt numb at that point.  When I woke up from surgery, my boyfriend tells me, you still have both your ovaries, instead I had been carrying a 6-week old infection that spread puss to my ovaries, uterus, abdomen, colon/rectum. You can imagine how I felt, emotionally and physically, all this pain.
Infections are extremely rare and this was a very bad one.  Because of all of this, my fallopian tubes are scared and I will probably need IVF to conceive as is will not happen spontaneously.  I was just freezing my eggs as an option because of my heart and fibroid history.  Basically, I have reduced my options when I thought I was being smart.  And I wonder if this is what killed half of my eggs at retrieval.  When I found this site and saw his reviews, I cried, I knew I had been screwed by this doctor.
I had to be out recovering for about 3 months, not working.  Ended up having to move upstate due to my precarious situation.  My living condition is good but very stressful.  I got the flu and to top it all, my second heart attack now.  I will stop here but you get the point, my entire life has been hanged for the worst.
I am thankful to this site and the other reviewers for sharing their story.
I am not one to leave a review ever but I felt like a responsibility for anyone debating Dr. G’s care.  With such a low review rate, I wonder why he’s even practicing and those hiring him to still be out there are to do their due diligence and be responsible.He was knowledgable,  kind, and was willing to explain every detail and possible outcome. I appreciated his candor and felt very comfortable speaking with him. And that I was in good care. My procedure went as expected and I felt like he was honest about my odds of retrieving healthy eggs. Which turned out even better than i expected. I was very comfortable in his care. I only saw him once or twice for each of my two cycles but always made me feel comfortable and told me everything I needed to know- answering all questions.  He did my second retrieval and made me feel at ease.  Joshua Klein did a wonderful job of making me feel like a human, instead of a number. I live in Chicago, but after our initial consultation, it was a no-brainer that I needed to fly to New York to have him do the procedure. I am so happy I did. He participated in every office visit. He took the time to educate me on each decision (timing, medication, etc.) and each step. One day, a nurse forgot to call me with dosage instructions. Dr. Klein called me, himself, to give the proper dosage info. No complaints. He had a very high level of engagement which I couldn't be happier about. I did not see Dr. Klein very much through the process, once at consultation and then again at the retrieval, but I did not really feel like I needed to see him that often, given that I was only doing an egg retrieval.  He was very pleasant and kind when I did see him though.  One thing I feel kind of unsure about is that when I told him that I knew that the success rate of freezing and thawing eggs was not as high as freezing and thawing embryos, he disagreed with me and said otherwise.  I am pretty sure that it is a known fact, but since his entire clinics business model is freezing eggs, I'm sure he feels that he has to believe this.   Dr. Klein is absolutely everything I could want in a doctor.  Of course I'd be even happier if we never had to cross paths for this, but considering the circumstances, I feel so blessed to have him as my doctor.  Having a doctor that you can trust is looking out for you and is reachable, explains things clearly really put my mind at ease throughout all the appointments.  I didn't dread the visits or worry what would be - I felt like I was in the hands of the best doctor that I could be.  He is really exceptional.  He is a genuinely kind person, not out of fluff or diplomacy.  And from what I understand, every patient feels that he is completely focused on them and creating the best outcome. I wish every physician in every field of medicine was as good as dr klein was as a
Dr, both medically as well as emotionally for the patient going through a tough time. He was outstanding. He spent a tremendous amount of time from my very first consult until we had a successful pregnancy and I was discharged, explaining every scenario and walking me and my husband through the process and what to expect. As well as what our options would be moving forward. I found Dr. Klein to be very empathetic and supportive. My situation was unique for many reasons (as are so many situations). He was understanding, never forgot my details, and explained everything in the context of my situation. 
The thing I liked most about him, was his friendly, easy demeanor and the fact that he was so easy to talk to. He was very honest, and didn't sugar coat anything, but did so with so much sensitivity, and warmth, which made all the difference for me. 
The few other times that I saw his partner, Dr.Cort, he was also really patient and warm. 
Both doctors were very knowledgable and didn't try to pressure me in any way. They very much included me in the decisions, and after giving me the facts about each stage, let me make decisions if I wanted to. 
My impression is that both Dr. Klein and Dr. Cort really know their field, and are really smart, and I definitely felt like I was in good hands while they treated me. Dr. Klein is super kind, patient, brilliant and detail oriented. He has a way of exuding confidence in his care and expertise, and his approach, especially open communication and detailed responses, put me at ease.  His upbeat, positive personality also made the monitoring visits more bearable. I'm still undergoing treatment although he really is an amazing doctor. When I had my miscarriage after my first iui cycle that morning I was rushed into his office and he sat with us as the clots passed and made sure we were able to understand what was going on. Although this process is taking way longer then expected I believe he's doing everything cautiously. The last cycle he's been more aggressive, and he makes sure we have a plan if this iui cycle doesn't work ivf is our next try... we found out the end of this week if it worked.He seems well-informed and willing to answer my questions and spend time with me going over information. I felt comfortable in his hands and believe he is good at his job. I liked him and appreciate him.Dr. Klein is fully present by each appointment and really listens to his patients and their concerns. He takes the time to explain all the information and answer any questions to make his patients as comfortable with the process as possible Dr. Klein was very knowledgable.  He explained information thoroughly but always in a way that was understandable.  He was kind and compassionate when giving difficult news.  He answered all my questions (and I had many) and he addressed all my concerns without judgement.Dr Klein is very knowledgeable, has a great bedside manner. He is responsible, professional, and kind. I had a great experience with Dr Klein and his team. My treatment and procedure were handled professionally, worry- and pain-free. Special kudos goes out to his team. If I can only can sum up  my experience with Dr. Klein with one word, it would be ""positive."" 
When the cup was half full, it was half full, not half empty. 
That was the most important to me. 
As a bonus he was also kind, compassionate and sensitive. Going through this can never be easy, and I faced some challenges. I so appreciated his mild manners and easy touch. Very pleasant and clearly explained the process and my fertility projections. The clinic was very attentive and accommodating. I felt like my concerns were addressed and the supporting materials I was provided were very helpful.I chose a female doctor because I think it’s more convenient. She is very nice and professional. The whole procedure went smoothly and I got a pretty good result. I didn’t feel anything miserable, the medication was efficient, I only injected 8 days to get it ready.He was very knowledgeable and intelligent, and inspired confidence in his decisions. While this approach may not be comforting to everyone, I appreciated his analytical perspective and focus on the data and statistics. I like information and expertise, and I never felt as if I was lacking in either of those during the course of my treatment.I liked him. He seemed very knowledgeable. He answered questions I had. I did have to wait a long time because he was presenting to another patient. He had a long presentation. The wait was inconvenient but I was overall pleased with the consultation. I would have preferred that he re-check a suspiciously low blood test number but as a practitioner I felt comfortable in his care Dr. Maslow cares about her patients and women's education around fertility.  She is passionate about what she does and wants her patients to have positive outcomes.  She communicates over the phone and over email.Strengths: very knowledgeable, answered all of my questions, made me feel optimistic while still being realistic about the expected outcome. 
Weaknesses: wouldn’t review my record before we spoke and would ask me questions that he could find in my records from previous visits.Dr Klein was very thorough through out the whole process he explained everything to me in detail was very patient with me and is very knowledgeable and made going through this process much easier then I expectedDr. Klein always made sure to be on call for my procedures
He always helped me stay positive and hopeful
he showed true compassion and interest in my care/needs even after success.
He is always available by email and phone if needed. Dr. Klein is honest but in a gentle way. He does an excellent job of setting realistic expectations without trying to romanticize an arduous journey. He is also more accessible than most doctors I surveyed which provides an additional layer of comfort.I loved working with Josh Klein.  He gave me very honest feedback and set my expectations. Other doctors wanted to run so many tests (many were invasive) to try to diagnose the problem or put me on meds (like Lupron, which I refused) to try to correct something that hadn't even been diagnosed.  Dr. Klein listened to my story and focused in on the one problem that had been identified a year earlier - scarring - that we thought had been solved (two visits to Dr. Isaacson in Boston, who I still highly recommend).  Before launching into other tests, he wanted to check in on that to see if it had come back.  We did a hysteroscopy and he removed some scarring.  My next transfer (#5!) was successful. Even with a 5.9 lining.  He didn't just apply the rule book on what next but really thought about the situation and it paid off.  I'm so grateful that I went to him. 

Also- the only reason I didn't see Josh Klein on every visit was because of restrictions related to COVID-19I wish someone had shared their experiences with Extend, so I could have skipped my 2 cycles with them, and saved my ovaries

Dont take me wrong, Dr Klein is very nice.  The clinic is pretty well organized.  (Dr G is a different story. Very rude and impatient )

But the methods they use are so aggressive and ineffective.  They are very rigid with statics, and treat every patient like how a textbook would instruct.   They try to pump as much medication into you as possible, hoping to get the best results.  But it turned out to be very counterproductive and I am afraid its harmful to my body in the long run.  And the results are so poor.  I only got 50% of mature eggs the first time, and the second time half of the eggs magically disappeared ( I think they ovulated earlier because the doctor was late!)

They use manupor unnecessarily.  They ask you to inject full dose of ganerilx every shot. They don't time well the ovulation Window.  They just rigidly go by the 36 hours rule.  (I strongly suspect in the second cycle, the missed the ovulation window, and lost half counts of my eggs.  Because the count of eggs was only half of what the unltrasound indicated.  But the doctor was not willing to tell me why.  They tried to hide the reasons.  I even got yelled by doctor G for asking about the reason )

I only found out how these things are wrong after I went to New Hope for my third cycle this month.  I was pretty skeptical about them at the beginning, and even wanted to go back to the extend. The extend sells them well for all the charts and statistic based result predication

But at New Hope, they customize the medication for you.  I didn't have to use manupor. They minimize both the ganerilx and trigger shots.  I felt less influenced by the drug during the whole cycle.  And the result was better.

New hope is not the best.  For example, they could have given me the wrong trigger shot medication if I didn't triple check with the nurse.   just for a full disclosure

But if I could have done it again, I wouldn't have gone to the extend at all.  I feel really regretted, not for the money,  but worried about how all the cycles might have impacted my health.  But it's my fault that I didn't do a thorough research first.  

So I just want to share the experience here.   I hope it will help someone who is going through the same situation-- egg freezingDr Klein was kind and helpful. He was honest with all the possible outcomes and made sure I understood what was happening. When I had concerns he made sure to explain options in-depth to make sure I felt comfortable to make a decision. Joshua Klein is an amazing Dr. I've used 4 Dr before i got to him. we couldn't imagine how we have ever used any other Dr. before. The patience, the clarity he always provided. He was always always there for us. there was no such a thing as not receiving a response on an email or phone call before the end of the day. Dr. G is extremely knowledgable and kind. I felt like he really understood and cared how I felt throughout the process and he took the time to answer every question big or small. I would (and have!) recommend Dr. G to friends. Very nice, good listener, explains thoroughly. Only bad experience that doctor “forgot” a gauze inside me. It was not him though but the doctor performing the procedure which was his colleague at the clinic  Dr. Klein was very responsive to email communications, he went through the process in detail with me and answered all my questions.  This gave me comfort in choosing Extend Fertility as well as my decision to go through the egg freezing process.  Dr. Klein is also very kind.Not only does Dr. Klein stand ""head & shoulders"" above other Reproductive Endocrinologists that I've seen but he stands out among any doctor I've known.  Dr. Klein cares genuinely about each patient and it shows in his communication, responsiveness and throughout every step of the journey.  I have never been disappointed.  Before Extend Fertility I was at a very well known, highly ranked fertility clinic where I would call in when I had a question, wait for over 15min on the phone with the receptionist and then be told the Dr will call you back when they get a moment which meant the next day.  However, I felt like I won the lottery with Dr. Guarnaccia (Dr. G). When I shared with my friends how I can email him and get a reply back in less than 10mins they were shocked. Actually, the first time I emailed him and got a quick response I was shocked too. I have never ever experienced that type of stellar service with any other doctor. It's a smaller office, but it's still a bit of a factory. At least it's a well oiled machine with many polite and friendly nurses and staff.Dr Klein took the time to explain everything to me and answer all my questions. He also took the time to make sure I understood. Whenever I had concerns, he made sure to put me at ease. This Dr has an exceptional nature - the Bedside manners of him and his whole staff are amazingDr. Guarnaccia took the time to explain the process to me every step of the way. He thoughtfully answered my questions throughout my stimulation and made sure I understood exactly why he made the decisions that he did regarding my dosage. Where do I start? It's been such a long journey for me. It started off in 2017 when I went through two rounds of egg freezing cycles at Extend. In 2019, I became an Expect Fertility client, as I was ready to begin my road to motherhood. Through it all, Dr. Klein has been extremely patient with my numerous questions. He has the best bedside manners and always thoughtful as he explains everything that he's doing. I'm a very detail oriented person and he was great with providing information without my having to ask. He's also very open minded to hear about my findings on the internet and discuss the subject matter.  I never felt like he was condescending and he never scoffed at what I had to say. He truly listens to his patients. And he always had hope. I understand that in this industry, the doctor has to be data and statistics driven. As a patient, it's always nice when after given all of the ratios and numbers (which is a huge dream zapper), the doctor ends it with- it only takes one! It allowed me to keep the faith and stay optimistic. During my visits to Extend Fertility I saw Dr. Guarnaccia and Dr. Maslow.  Dr. Guarnaccia preformed my medical scan as well as my retrieval and Dr. Maslow met with me for my final follow up.  The process went very seamless and I had all of my questions answered.  

Dr.Guarnaccia is wonderful.  I felt very comfortable under his care, especially for the actual egg retrieval.  Following my procedure, I had no pain and the aftercare plan was very well communicated.   I met with Dr. Maslow when I first was thinking about starting the process and she was very clear about what I should expect and answered all my questions, she also called in a few days after my retrieval to check in and answer any other questions, which really made me feel like I was in great, caring hands. I would highly recommend both doctors!Dr. Guarnaccia always answered questions with patience and understanding.  He's been doing this for a long time and he has empathy for his patients.During my consultation, Dr. G reviewed details of my blood work and ultrasound, and the likely outcome of my egg freezing. I discussed my extensive family history of breast cancer and Dr. G strongly recommended I get genetic testing done before the egg freezing process so that we could adjust the hormones if necessary. She was very warm and understanding, I felt like she cared a lot about me and my outcome. I felt like I can trust her and she found the best treatment for me while answering my questions.Dr G was always kind and honest during my scans and egg retrieval procedures.  As a 40 year old woman with only 1 ovary I had to be realistic about my situation. I really appreciated that though it would be a longer road I was always told that there was still hope.    Dr. Klein and all of his staff treated me like a person throughout the 3-years it took me to bank 22 eggs. I am 35 and have low ovarian reserve and am a poor performer. During the lows, both the nurses and the doctor's were actually there for me, and made themselves available to talk details, new strategies or just empathize (plenty of tears shed). I was an out-of-state patient, so this was especially important. Because of this, I'd recommend Extend Fertility to anyone. She sat down with me face-to-face for a full hour and thoroughly went through my test results with me. She also went through other hypothetical AMH blood levels with me and how that might impact my anticipated results.Dr. Klein's practice is staffed with warm nurses who greet you on those early morning blood test/ultra sound runs. They are careful and sensitive paying much attention to making you feel comfortable and under the greatest care. Understandably results lie in G-d's hands but they are super positive and hopeful always wishing you well and to hear good news.He clearly had not looked at my file before he came in to perform surgery on me.  My medical history is complex so it was obvious, he was scrolling through his stack of papers.  He had to continuously leave the room to search for more information on the computer.HE took the time to explain everything very well in our intro meeting, while i did not see him a lot during the cycle, he was available if I needed to speak with him and was very nice. Everyone knew my name and remembered me between cyclesDr. Klein's consultation was very extensive and detailed. He made it personal and applicable to me, my age, my current situation. Our consultation lasted over an hour. It never felt rushed, and I received much more information and guidance than I expected. I have heard that with many other clinics, the nurses handle the office visits and the doctor is only seen at the time of egg extraction. This was not the case at Extend Fertility, as Dr. Klein participated in every single office visit. I liked the Extend Fertility, the nurses were very sweet and kind and the clinic was never full.  I never had to wait very long for my appointments, and the staff was very kind and understanding.  This question best sums up where Dr. Klein stands out - he absolutely treats each patient as a human being.  Every appointment when he's in the room you feel you have his undivided attention - and he's not just being courteous.  He actually is giving you his attention, and thinks about what you're saying or asking.   Eventhough when I would email him I would try to be brief and matter of fact so as not to take his time, he always responded very kindly.  He goes out of his way for his patients, with a no-big-deal kind of attitude, really special doctor to have. I have never experienced the care and compassion Dr Klein showed with any dr I’ve ever been to before him. The staff were trained to be extra sensitive to each patients personal, and cultural situation. At both locations of this clinic the staff was very careful not to call my name when it was my turn if there were other patients present. The staff were extremely attentive and patient before and during the retrieval.
Because this is a smaller clinic, I felt like was an important member of their clinic. Questions, submitted by email or by phone, were answered promptly (usually within an hour) by the doctor or head nurse, no matter what time of day it was. Although the doctor had many patients to see, I never felt rushed when he was with me. He answered all my questions no matter how repetitive they might have been, he was reassuring but honest and realistic with me, which really helped lower my anxiety. 
The level of sensitivity was really outstanding. Dr. Klein is by far the best doctor I have ever had. His knowledge, patience, kindness and empathy are unsurpassed.  After having multiple miscarriages and an unexplained infertility diagnosis, Dr. Klein gave me hope that I could still conceive a healthy child someday. He and the Extend Fertility team made this stressful process easier with their personalized care, organizational procedures and clear communication.  During every step of the process, I was in contact with either a nurse or Dr. Klein, who reassured me of my progress.  Dr. Klein, as busy as he was, never failed to answer my questions in great detail and in a manner that I could easily understand. He is a gem of a doctor and one in whom I have great confidence. He is extremely patient, kind, he sits with you and makes sure you understand everything completly and feel comfortable before getting started. Makes sure we know exactly what we are getting into. Never rushes. Always happy and cheerful He was very straightforward and informative. Easy to talk to, willing and able to answer all my questions. So far I’ve had a really great experience at Expect Fertility. One example that stands out is the day of my egg retrieval the Dr. On call was not Dr. Klein who did my initial consultation and on his own he chose to change his schedule so he can be the one to do my retrieval. Also the nurses are all so sweet and helpful Dr. Klein listened to my concerns, answered all my questions, and understood my feelings while delivering both good and bad news.I have had an incredible experience with Extend Fertility. The process that led to the procedure lasted for about 10 days and during that period of time I felt really well taken care of. The procedure itself was a breeze. I would like to thank Dr. Klein, Dayna, Ilaina, Leslie, Jordana, the procedure room nurse Daniella and the entire incredible team for being so positive, welcoming, flexible, professional, organized, hard-working and nice. I recommend Extend Fertility and Dr Klein to everyone, who would like an ""insurance policy"" for having children later in life.

Dr. Klein always took the time to put me at ease, he was very sensitive to my specific circumstances, and patiently answered all my questions. He was always cautiously optimistic and positive. This had a tremendous impact on my mental well-being going through the cycle.Dr Maslow was very nice and explained my fertility in great detail. I ended up being treated by another doctor in the practice but both of them were very attentive and supportive.She is very nice and with big smile. A kind of warm feeling. Because much of this new practice is still entwined with the egg freezing practice (Extend), there is a high volume of patients, but Dr. Klein and his team ensured that there was a personal quality to visits and treatment.Doctor took time to answer questions. Had a very well prepared presentation that answered most questions (which I liked a lot). Was thorough The Doctor answered questions and provided realistic expectations The doctor made jokes and had great bedside manner. Dr. Klein and his staff are amazing! While being very professional they were caring and reassuring through the whole process! What they accomplish is truly miraculous!Dr Klein is always available by email
He always takes the time to respond in detail and made sure to be on call for all my procedures Dr. Klein and his staff were incredible through my journey. My initial exam results were a bit unexpected and shocking but his team reassured me every step of the way, and given the initial diagnosis I couldn't be happier with my results.I briefly went to RMA NY (didn't count in my # of docs) and spent about year at Cornell.  I can't stress enough about how much better the smaller clinics are.  You see your doctor check-ups, you can reach out and easily reach the doctor or a nurse who knows your case, and when you walk in, you're not surrounded by a dozen other girls, waiting like cattle.  The person at the front desk knows your name, and dealing with Rx's and billing is SO much easier!!  Lastly but most importantly, I received customized care.  At Cornell, I just went through the standard process and when it didn't work, I was told to look into surrogacy.  I cannot stress enough how much better the experience is at Extend than those other larger clinics.His demeanor is compassionate He spent a lot of time with me in the consultation (over 45 minutes) going through lots of details about the process and answering all my questions.  Dr. Klein also made himself available via email for any follow-up questions and he answered right away.",9.200000000000001,8.400000000000002,"Though there are plenty good doctors on the West Coast, there are none I found as caring and skilled as Dr. Klein. Guarnaccia came in as a tourist to perform surgery on me. My procedure went as expected and I felt like he was honest about my odds of retrieving healthy eggs. I didn't dread the visits or worry what would be - I felt like I was in the hands of the best doctor that I could be. Dr. Klein is super kind, patient, brilliant and detail oriented. I like information and expertise, and I never felt as if I was lacking in either of those during the course of my treatment. Not only does Dr. Klein stand ""head & shoulders"" above other Reproductive Endocrinologists that I've seen but he stands out among any doctor I've known."
50,Extend Fertility,advice,"Have your questions ready because Dr. Klein is very thorough and ready to answer any questions. Feel comfortable asking questions, because they both do a wonderful job making the patient feel comfortable and outlining clear expectations. Do the research before you start the process and be as informed as possible.  It goes by fast and a lot of information will be thrown your way.  If you know the questions to ask you'll always get an informed response.Come with your questions prepared--your anxiety will lessen as he gives you concrete information.Ask all questions you have and let her know your wishes, she solved a lot of issues that I thought could not be changed.My work schedule forced me to come into the clinic very early when they opened at 7am and sometimes I would miss having him scan me.  If its important to you to be always seen by the doctor I recommend coming in a little later (8am)Your business is growing so fast! Add a phlebotomist to decrease morning wait times, or schedule actual appointment instead of a window. (This last trip, I waited over an hour for every monitoring visit).  I would come with a list of questions for her. There’s a lot of basic information that needs to be told every single patient but beyond that it really is up to you to do your research and make sure you ask the right questions so that you get the answers you need to feel comfortable with your personal care.Come early to your appointments because you will be seen based on your arrival time! Save yourself a bad ending.  In my opinion, he should not be practicing and not hired as a per diem.  You would think he is qualified and that you should trust him.  I fell victim of an unprepared doctor with overwhelmingly bad reviews.  Perhaps he has a calling in another field but not fertility.You won't see him too much, but i was not too concerned about that. Overall the clinic sets a style of working with patients that I appreciated. Ask him any questions you have to make sure you understand all steps and feel comfortable about the procedureTake advantage of the free consultation! Ask him every question that crosses your mind. Extend is mainly for people who want to freeze eggs, so you will not have as many interactions with him as you might if you were going through the full process of IVF, etc. I thought he was fine for the purposes of egg freezing, patient and answered questions throughout the process, but it was really the staff and the educational materials on Extend's website that were the standout for me. Just become his patient.  You don't need any other advice. To be prepared to have an amazing experience with him and his staff. Just to keep in mind that some days there will be a long wait time. Don't let his boyish looks fool you! He might look young, but he is extremely capable. If you are considering Extend Fertility, a consultation with Dr. Klein will convince you that you will be placed under great care and reassure you that you are doing the best thing for yourself by proactively preserving your fertility. To have patience, and to be optimistic... and to make sure to ask a million questions :)I would go in with an open mind and understand that he is a busy man but he is present with you! He goes over all pertinent information and makes you feel well-informed. He is not going to add fluff but I think that is a good thing. He knows what he is talking about and has a lot of education and experience to back it up. Feel free to ask as many questions as you would like. Dr. Klein is very knowledgeable and patiently explains the process and everything about it Ask all your questions and don't worry if they are insignificant in your mind, Dr. Klein will understand, answer you thoroughly, and validate your concerns.Making sure that you understand every step of the treatment is very important. Dr Klein and his team make all the important information easily accessible but if you are unsure about something, just shoot them a quick email or give them a call. You are in a good place and in good hands.I would note that given the timing of your cycle you will be examined by other doctors within the practice, as well as the actual retrieval. Don’t fear of anything,  I feel the procedure just like a regular period.Expect to see a wide variety of doctors and nurses in the course of your treatment.
Be ready to wait Have a baseline knowledge of fertility.  Do your own research and be prepared to ask specific questions He is very busy, so be ready to be seen by other doctors in the practice. He has a lot of experience so you can rest assured that you’re in good hands. Your in good handsdont be afraid to ask questionsBe patient.Trust him! and the other doctors are great too.  Dr. G did my transfer (because of COVID restrictions) and he was great!!Don’t go to that clinic Insist that he does the procedure himself Ask him as many questions as you need!",9.200000000000001,8.400000000000002,"Have your questions ready because Dr. Klein is very thorough and ready to answer any questions. Dr. Klein is very knowledgeable and patiently explains the process and everything about it Ask all your questions and don't worry if they are insignificant in your mind, Dr. Klein will understand, answer you thoroughly, and validate your concerns."
51,Extend Fertility,nurse,"Jordana, my IVF coordinator was extremely helpful and able to answer my questions throughout the process.  She was super organized and helped with all the long-distance logistics too.   Most of our correspondence was by email.  

The nurses were great - everyone knows who you are.  Always got a call from them pretty early in the day with the medication instructions, plus a clear email.   If I had a question for them, I'd call and get a call back pretty quickly usually.  Being able to email them would've been nice since often when I called they were on the phone with other patients, in a meeting etc - but it was fine, since they would call me back quickly.  And if I ever had a very pressing question or situation and a nurse wasn't available that minute, there was always someway somehow that someone would be able to help me.  As a team, they all cared.  The staff at Extend Fertility as a whole was amazing.  Everyone was so caring and had no problem answering questions.  The communication was great during my procedure which made me feel so much more comfortable.  

Tamar my fertility advisor is amazing.  She made me feel much more at ease each step, because she answered all of my questions and was very caring.

Molly the nurse I worked with is also amazing.  She clearly and thoroughly showed me how to mix and administer my medication.   She took her time in explaining and answering any questions.  If it was not for her, I do not think I would have been as comfortable administering my medication.  Dayna became my biggest supporter throughout the three years I spent freezing eggs at Extend. As an out-of-state patient, she worked closely with me to schedule appointments, fax in orders to facilities in my home city, get questions answered quickly and responded to emails in less than 8 hours (and usually within the hour). Logistically, she is amazing-- and personally she is incredible. She is THE reason my experience at Extend has been so positive. The nursing staff at expect fertility are the nicest group of women I’ve ever experienced. They are all super helpful and aiming to please. They really were instrumental in making the ivf process as stress free as can beI had two nurses assigned to me and both of them were excellent. I felt well taken care of at all times.Awesome! They seriously were my support team. From training to phone calls they were patient and caring. Alla held my hand until i was able to do it on my own,  i really felt that they were rooting for me to succeed. During the egg retrieval i was treated like royalty. Cara was very helpful and well organized. She was always up to date with what was going on with my case and she took care of all issue. I often had special requests which she took care of very competently. I felt like I can depend on her. At one point I was traveling and needed help urgently, I emailed her about the issue, she called me within seconds and solved my problem right away.Toby is straightforward yet kind and compassionate always wishing for good news. Clear with instructions too.I do not have any grievances with the nurses, they were all very nice, so was my care coordinator.  Actually, the time I came in a week after my first ER visit, 2 of the nurses asked me if I needed help getting dressed.  That is how bad my infection was, they felt sorry for me.  I am fair and would rate them fairly, according to my experience.Sarah was my fertility advisor and was amazing-I would email her with any questions or concerns and she always responded quickly.  I saw Ana the sonographer for most of my ultrasound-she was the best!  So caring and informative.  All the medical assistants were great- never had someone take my blood with such ease and barely any pain.  All the nurses who called with medication information were so helpful with any questions.  So thankful for Tania and Angela who went out of their way to help me!Excellent!  I think it says something about Dr. Klein that everyone who works in his office is kind and caring.  I haven't found one exception.   The value there is not on how much money they can rake in, but rather on caring for their patients - and it's across the board. Nursing staff on blood draw days were amazing. 
Toby was blunt, said things like they were and always clear with directions and good with call backs. All of the staff members showed extreme sensitivity to me and my personal situation. 
The nurses not only made sure I was comfortable, but were also culturally sensitive to my religious and cultural background. For example, at their boro park location in brooklyn, the nurses never ask u to say your name out loud. Instead, they will ask u to write it down. They also won't use your name to get your attention or call you in, and instead will either walk over to you or make eye contact and nod when it is your turn. This tiny show of sensitivity demonstrated to me that the staff understood and respected the fact that the community is very close knit, that everyone knows each other and that this is a very private personal journey for each woman there. 
Alla especially was considerate of my personal circumstances, and went to lengths to ensure that I didn't feel awkward or uncomfortable, for example by having me wait in a different area to a woman who was trying to have a baby, as I wasn't able to do that due to my difficult relationship status. Her patience and compassion were touching. This combined with her fast and efficient response to all my queries really made me feel like she was by my side the whole way through. Dayna and Alla were my primary nurses.  They were both diligent in their care and clearly communicated my daily instructions via phone and email. They were also available during the visits and during the evenings whenever I had questions about the injections.She always makes sure to call you with results right away, has compassion towards you, and is friendly... definetly makes you feel comfortable and always try's to make you feel better when you don't get the results you want to hear All of the nurses at Extend were lovely and made me feel very comfortable. They explained everything clearly and answered all of my questions thoroughly. My fertility advisor Kezia is great! She is very friendly and reachable. She is so patient and answered all my questions. She helped me made it. And all the nurses are so nice and patient. They are a well organized team.Jordana was my adviser and is amazing! She showed me a lot of compassion was always there for me! Any time I email her, which was often she got back to me right away! Everyone was great . They knew my name and my case and knew what I had been through and really shared in my joy when I finally had success.",9.200000000000001,8.400000000000002,"Jordana, my IVF coordinator was extremely helpful and able to answer my questions throughout the process.

52,Extend Fertility,clinic,"I wish someone had shared their experiences with Extend, so I could have skipped my 2 cycles with them, and saved my ovaries

Dont take me wrong, Dr Klein is very nice.  The clinic is pretty well organized.  (Dr G is a different story. Very rude and impatient )

But the methods they use are so aggressive and ineffective.  They are very rigid with statics, and treat every patient like how a textbook would instruct.   They try to pump as much medication into you as possible, hoping to get the best results.  But it turned out to be very counterproductive and I am afraid its harmful to my body in the long run.  And the results are so poor.  I only got 50% of mature eggs the first time, and the second time half of the eggs magically disappeared ( I think they ovulated earlier because the doctor was late!)

They use manupor unnecessarily.  They ask you to inject full dose of ganerilx every shot. They don't time well the ovulation Window.  They just rigidly go by the 36 hours rule.  (I strongly suspect in the second cycle, the missed the ovulation window, and lost half counts of my eggs.  Because the count of eggs was only half of what the unltrasound indicated.  But the doctor was not willing to tell me why.  They tried to hide the reasons.  I even got yelled by doctor G for asking about the reason )

I only found out how these things are wrong after I went to New Hope for my third cycle this month.  I was pretty skeptical about them at the beginning, and even wanted to go back to the extend. The extend sells them well for all the charts and statistic based result predication

But at New Hope, they customize the medication for you.  I didn't have to use manupor. They minimize both the ganerilx and trigger shots.  I felt less influenced by the drug during the whole cycle.  And the result was better.

New hope is not the best.  For example, they could have given me the wrong trigger shot medication if I didn't triple check with the nurse.   just for a full disclosure

But if I could have done it again, I wouldn't have gone to the extend at all.  I feel really regretted, not for the money,  but worried about how all the cycles might have impacted my health.  But it's my fault that I didn't do a thorough research first.  

So I just want to share the experience here.   I hope it will help someone who is going through the same situation-- egg freezingEvery nurse I came in contact with was kind and knowledgable. They all asked how I was doing and kept my spirits up when things were getting a bit rough. Nurses there are all on amazing level - each and every office visit or scan i felt as if i was their only patient - The nursing staff was super friendly.The nurses were sweet, smart, friendly, patient and follow up. However, you have to be organized as things can slip through the cracks. A pharmacy didn't get the prescription and they never told me which type of trigger shot i needed until i asked. I did call to speak to a nurse after a treatment as i was experiencing vertigo and they were useless with that issue. However, this does not surprise me since it was not directly related to the procedureI loved the nursing staff. They are kind, compassionate, and thorough. Especially the doctors assistants who do the blood work and the vaginal ultra sounds. They gave me as much info as they were able to and were very sweet. The clinic is relatively new and aesthetically pleasing. It feels more like a spa rather than a doctors waiting room. However, they have become really popular in NYC so waiting times may be a bit longer on busy days.Extend Fertility knows exactly what they are doing! The logistics class, where they teach you how to inject yourself, was so helpful! I don't know what I would have done without that. They also call you every day during your cycle to make sure you know what you're supposed to do that evening and when to come back in. Every person I came in contact with was kind and helpful. This clinic is one i would recommend everyone to use - ive used multiple clinics before this one and i can not compare it at all to any other one. People going thru infertility have more than enough on their plate. at least they have the warmth and professionalism they deserveAlthough Dr. G was my main doctor, I did also meet Dr. Klein and Dr. Maslow through an egg freezing 101. I found them all to be equally knowledgable and passionate about helping their patients. The staff at Extend is thoughtful and very helpful. They make this process simple and even enjoyable. They were really bad as drawing blood Strengths are good location on 57th and 7th in Manhattan, clean and bright office, friendly staff, and they generally get you in and out of appointments quickly.  The weakness is that the waiting area is fairly small, so at times they had to use an extra conference room for waiting seating.  On one or two of my visits for blood work and an ultrasound, I waited for longer than I would have liked to be seen.I liked the extend fertility clinic.  It's nicely designed! When you walk in for monitoring in the morning, you are greeted warmly (it's not a cold silent room like waiting rooms in fertility clinics are known for).   Most of the staff knows you.  Things run efficiently.  I liked that there weren't set appointments for monitoring, you can just come in within a certain time range, at your convenience.  Molly, Stephanie and Valerie. They had the most patience with me. I had SO many questions. They never seem exasperated with me. They made me feel like all of my questions and concerns were valid to them. When I had a situation happen- Valerie was calm while I was frantic. She said that she would call me in 30 minutes to check on my symptoms- and she called in exactly 30 min. She followed up a couple of more times afterwards. She truly cared. Extend Fertility Strengths:  Lovely and caring staff.  Good communication.  Clean and organized facility.  The nurses did a great job with communicating next steps and answering follow up questions.  During treatment for egg retrieval it is a lot monitoring and blood work, but Extend Fertility was efficient, so that even when I had to go to work afterwards, it was a huge stress.  I only wish that they had an Extend Fertility also in Brooklyn.  

I did 2 rounds of IVF at Columbia but had to stop because my insurance was no longer going to cover IVF and Columbia was too expensive. 

I was choosing between RMA and Expect Fertility. I went with Expect Fertility because of Dr. Guarnaccia experience & knowledge, the rates, and the state of the art lab. I didn't go with RMA because they suggested a birth control protocol. 

Strengths:
The facility is new and clean.  The staff is super friendly and knowledgable. The pricing is great. I never had to wait more than 15min in the waiting room. The Drs here were directors at top clinics. The clinic is great with email communication. 

Weakness: The billing department took a bit to get insurance paperwork done. The nurses at Extend were amazing!  They were kind and compassionate and always got an answer for any question I had.  They are truly the backbone of the clinic and some of the nicest people I've met.While I did not work specifically with one nurse, they were all compassionate and able to answer any questions I had.The nursing staff at the clinic is wonderful.  I've been going to Extend for 2 years.  The only negative thing I have to say is that as they grow in popularity and become a lot busier small details fall through the cracks a bit in terms of being able to ask follow up questions and phone callsExtend has some of the best rates in the country-- financially and scientifically. They offer affordable egg freezing without cutting corners or reducing the quality bar. Conservatively estimating, I saved $50k over the course of five freezing cycles by choosing Extend instead of local options. The nursing staff are all generally friendly, and helpful. They were all very accommodating of my fear of needles.Their practice is geared towards women who want to freeze their eggs for the future and not for any immediate treatment, which is what i was doing. It had a smaller feel then an RMI and was less expensive (my insurance did not provide coverage). Everyone is super friendly and nice and wait times are really managable. However, you have to stay organized the whole time as things can fall through the cracks. This will happen at any of the  egg retrieval or ivf clinice.I love that the clinic is specifically geared towards women freezing eggs and not IVF. Since none of the patience are necessarily ready to have kids, they truly understand the needs of working professional women who are freezing eggs for later. They really kept focused on the fact we are planning for something in the future and likely have very busy lives right now. They are great at scheduling everything in a way that gets you in and out as quickly as possible. There can be personal embarrassment about freezing your eggs and they do such an amazing job of making you feel confident in your decision. Overall the nursing staff was great. I did not have a specific nurse I worked with, but they were all great, responsive, communicative, etc. There was only 1 day where they didn't call me at the designated time to provide dosage instructions. I left a message with them and Dr. Klein called me within 30 min with instructions. I will say, they aren't the best with drawing blood. One nurse poked me a few times before I asked for a different nurse. As I said, the staff was really the standout here.  They were really compassionate, always available, and very pleasant. I have not had much experience with the nursing staff but everyone at the clinic seems very warm and professional.Overall I have been really happy at expect fertility. The staff are all nice and the atmosphere is pleasant. They have a state of the art lab which is super important for treatments to yield positive results From the moment you walk into the office, every single nurse is kind, gentle, understanding, and thorough.  What I liked most about Extend Fertility was their personalized approach to every patient. It felt like they genuinely care about their patients, one patient at a time.  Great service and great results made me happy. They were very professional, yet they didn't treat me like a number. Everyone was always friendly and smiling. 
I believe that freezing my eggs is probably the most important thing I have done for myself and would recommend anyone considering it to just do it and not wait. The biological clock is a real thing.They were very warm and made sure to follow up every day.
They seemed rush - especially after the treatment had been paid for. I felt like an inconvenience to them Communication was erratic.  Never spoke to the same person and questions were not always answered.  Courteous, compassionate, knowledgeable.The office is a nice and warm environment
Feels very welcoming 
Nurses are always smiling and compassionate 
They could work on communication skills...like calling back and getting questions answered more efficiently It depended on the day and time I showed up. Some days were less crowded, but the later you go in, the more crowded it will be. There were some days where they had to put people in conference rooms, but they made sure everyone had a seat and they're always offering water! The clinic was extend fertility, which is not in the list of clinics given here.  It is much more affordable than other clinics. It is friendly and doesn’t feel like a hospital which was nice. Waiting times can be very long on some days The staff truly cares and treats you like a human. They call you by name and will cheer you on. If you get there first thing in the morning for monitoring, it’s easy to get in and out. It tends to get more crowded later in the morning. I think Extend Fertility knows their business inside and out and I was happy with my results.  It's hard to form a normal medical relationship with the doctors/nurses/staff because you're only a patient at the clinic temporarily so sometimes you can feel like a number.  However, I think the staff tries their hardest not to make you feel that way, even on the busiest of days.The clinic is very organized and efficient. At times there would be many clients waiting to get their ultrasounds done in the mornings, but the process moved fast and I was never left waiting for long. The staff really listens to your concerns and makes themselves available to you.The clinic is very well organized and the set up is designed to improve the results. The monitoring is not just for safety but to optimize for the chances of a good outcome. They usually don't schedule the cycle but start based on the natural cycle which improves chances, also the retrieval date is based on the monitoring and therefore flexible, this increases the chance for an optimal result. I had both retrievals on weekend days, many clinics don't do that. I believe their method is responsible for the great results I had.The clinic is in a great location in midtown near a lot of train lines.  The staff is very friendly and know what they are doing.  I always felt that I was in good hands (which is important when you have to get blood drawn every other day!) The hours are great for people like myself who have to start work early (I would normally go there for 7am for my monitoring appointments).  The only weakness I would say is that as they grow in popularity the waiting area can get a little cramped The monitoring experience has changed over time. As the business is growing, there are more women in the waiting room, so you should plan to be there for an hour. The front desk is extremely kind and helpful and the appointments are quick and informative. If you have a question or want to talk to a doctor instead of an ultrasound technician, you can.  Extend Fertility provides egg freezing exclusively, so I found the prices are lower than other clinics for this very specific service.  They used to offer free consultations and diagnostic testing, but now they charge $250 and if you end up using them to freeze your eggs you get to apply that amount to the cost of your egg freezing cycle. Dr. Klein's Manhattan and new Brooklyn are beautiful airy and clean. There's a team of nurses and Dr's who are driven to help you achieve results. They also give you space to decide how you would like to move forward and are there to advise you on the best protocol. Trust them.It was a well run machine. Sometimes it took 15  min and other times it was 30The clinic did not inform me that on Sabbath day my doctor will not show and that instead I would get a low-rated 'fertility' doctor.  That is unacceptable.  I should have had the heads up to make a sound decision, instead of feeling pressed 10 mins before surgery in my hospital gown.
Everyone was so friendly and willing to help.  The only thing I didn’t love was that everyday you saw different people- basically whoever was on call that day.  I never had a doctor or nurse assigned to me.  I just got lucky and mainly saw the ones I felt the most comfortable with. The clinic is great in that it doesn't feel clinic-y at all. The lobby is warm and comfortable. I never saw more than 4 patients waiting in the lobby at one time. I have been to other clinics that felt cold, uncomfortable, and had farms of patients waiting to be called. The clinic is really nice, and there was never a long wait.  I felt like I was going to a spa every time I visited.  Very new, sterile, and modern. The educational materials they have available on their website are awesome.  Everyone going through the IVF process should read those materials b/c they do such a good job of explaining it in a way that you can understand. I was seen in 2 different locations depending on the day of the week for monitoring and/or IUIs. 
Parking in Brooklyn was surprisingly good. And the city was ok but it was only on the weekends. I preferred the office in the city from an aesthetic point. I understand that the clinic has moved from the location they were in while I was a patient there, to a different location, so I can't say much about the new Manhattan location. 
The location in Brooklyn, is discreet, and comfortable. Come early to avoid a wait, as the doctor likes to give each patient as much time as they need.
Patients should remember to check the parking signs on the street, and park on the side streets. The avenue has street cleaning every morning between 8-9 am!!! Finding and learning about Extend Fertility was a life changer for me. I've looked into other clinics and either 1) found their prices inexplicably high, given that I knew I would have to do multiple cycles because of my age, or 2) I didn't like the factory feel.  Extend is a specialized clinic so it is smaller and is able to provide personalized and individualized care.  Because of its focus, the pricing for egg freezing makes a lot more sense and makes the financial aspect more manageable. 

Be aware that the lab isn't fully complete yet but should be by Dec 2016.  In the meantime, the retrievals are done in a surgical clinic in the UES.  Communication, appearance, compassionate, does what's right for you. Never fails to answer questions

Weakness I would say since they just moved the office isn't so nice although it's worth it I really like Extend Fertility! They marketed to me on Instagram and since that ad, the process had been very easy! They assign an administrator to you and he/she is with you throughout the process. That has been very nice. Their monitoring window was for a couple of hours in the morning. I was able to go in and still be at work on time. It is a first come first serve basis yet they were quick and professional. This method worked well for me since there was no pressure for a specific appointment time and there was a lower wait time as well since they took you in as you came The biggest strength of this office is the compassion.  They are understanding, kind, and thorough. As with any clinic, you always need to be your own advocate. If you have questions, you must ask.  If you have concerns, you must voice them.  Be knowledgable as a patient but also be trusting because this team only wants what's best for you.  They were very easy-going with the times i could show up, making sure to schedule them on days that would be convenient for me.The clinic was very professional and clearly outlined the process during the initial consultation. They were accommodating with appointments and the staff was lovely. The nurses and doctor were wonderful on the day of the procedure and followed up with me multiple times in the days following.This clinic is the egg freezing industry leader. I’m happy I made a good choice. I did so much research to find it. I enjoyed the advanced technology and professional team. The whole procedure was pretty enjoyable.It's busy, and I did feel like I had to follow up with certain aspects of treatment (e.g., making sure the pharmacy had my medication orders, etc.). I think this may have been because I began my cycle on a holiday, however.
For me the greatest strength was affordability and location. They are in midtown and easy to get to. The doctor also seemed very competent. The support team I was not impressed with however. I’ve had 3 different “coordinators” since visiting them. Also had one phone reception call that where the clinic person was rude- this did not occur until after treatment was paid in full however. That was quite disappointing Communication was problematic and obtaining records was an issue.  The steps of the process were not made transparent.  Ex.  How long would the eggs be stored in the clinic and then shipped to the storage facility was not readily available.  Had to request that details be made in writing.  For example, they called you over the phone to tell you the number of eggs that were going to be frozen but did not offer a written confirmation of the record unless I requested.  

Very organized and able to see me on time for my appointments. Space is very nice and welcoming. Staff is very professional. Website is great and they offer good online educational resources. 
Centrally located in midtown. Able to offer discounts at certain pharmacies.I had total trust in them and they made me feel like I was the only patient even though they had a full waiting room! They are professional and really kind and I looked forward to going to my appointments there!Strengths are the intelligence and compassion of the doctors, the kindness and attention to detail of the staff, in-house procedures (vs. having to go to a hospital), ability to email and check results on the site.Early mornings when they first open would result in less patients in the waiting room. They would be more women as it got later in the morning. Though, even with a lot of women waiting- the staff were very efficient. They would get your blood work and shortly after you would have your ultrasound. It was a well oiled machine even on the busiest of days.  When I first started at Extend they had appointments during morning monitoring hours but for my last cycle they had changed that to just showing up anytime between 7-9:30 am which I didn't like.  Busy days were harder but everyone was always kind and worked very hard.The window for the monitoring appointments was large enough that I never felt rushed or that it was an inconvenience. As I mentioned, at times the waiting area was very crowded, but the staff is so efficient that it moved fast.Very well organized, quick and efficient. Staff is well trained and very kind and respectful.their monitoring hours were perfect because they started at 7am which allowed me to go before work.  This was important for me so that I did not have to explain anything to my workplace I haven’t had ultrasound monitoring performed yet, but I do know that it is a general window.They were very flexible with appointment times- able to go in really early (7am) when needed to go to work.  But was also able to do later around 9 when didn’t have to rush in.  Appointments were quick and usually less than 30 minutes.  I would get my blood taken then have an ultrasound then would be done.It was really easy to make appointments, always available before work, and never had to wait long to get seen. Come early to avoid a wait, as the doctor likes to give each patient as much time as they need.
Their monitoring hours is 7:00am-9:30am every day. Which is very convenient. The waiting time is very short. ",9.200000000000001,8.400000000000002,"I wish someone had shared their experiences with Extend, so I could have skipped my 2 cycles with them, and saved my ovaries

Dont take me wrong, Dr Klein is very nice. I have not had much experience with the nursing staff but everyone at the clinic seems very warm and professional. They were very professional, yet they didn't treat me like a number. The clinic is very well organized and the set up is designed to improve the results. This method worked well for me since there was no pressure for a specific appointment time and there was a lower wait time as well since they took you in as you came The biggest strength of this office is the compassion."
53,Extend Fertility,protocol,"Although I do not remember the specific medications, I do remember feeling pretty decent throughout stimulation.  I am especially appreciative for a specific out-of-the-box decision he made during my treatment that I believe contributed to the success of my first IVF cycle with him.   I didn't feel like there were cookie-cutter protocols, but rather that each patient's success was given adequate thought.  Estrogen patch before my period
 Follistim 300 units
Menopur 225 IUIt was a standard egg retrieval process. They told me to add more hormones based on the growth of my follicles. My starting protocol was 225iu of Follistim and 2 vials of Menopur with a Lupron trigger.In 2017, I went through 2 egg freezing cycles which I had a total of 16 eggs frozen. In 2019, I started the IUI process. After 4 failed IUI attempts we decided to try for IVF cycle. My body didn’t take to the IVF medication so we fertilized my frozen eggs. 5 embryos were created using ICSI and then PGS tested. We transferred one which didn’t result in a pregnancy. I tried another round of IVF which this time my body took to the medications. Dr. Klein retrieved 10 eggs and 5 embryos were created using ICSI. I did not get PGS testing done. He transferred 2 and now I’m pregnant with twins. Microdose Lupron 10 units 2x a day
Gonal-F 450 units 1x a day
Menopur 2 vials 1x a day
Estrdiol patchesDr. G explained my bloodwork and ultrasound results, and showed me data comparing my results to others my age. He was specific about his recommendations regarding getting genetic testing done for my family's history of breast cancer.I had a short agonist protocol which was closely monitored and had frequent dose adaptions and an lupron trigger. The retrieval date was determined based on the monitoring. She did everything to ensure a good numebr and quality of eggs and the results with her were excellent and a lot better than in my previous treatments. She was able to retrieve a large number of eggs, almost all of them were mature. On my request the MIs were also frozen.A year prior I had to have my right ovary removed due to a dermoid cyst. Due to my age I had a diminished ovarian reserve and had to take the maximum amount of hormones to see good results.  For my first cycle we did a Follistim and Menopur protocol. But my body didn't respond and the cycle had to be cancelled early on.   I did an estrogen patch for the days leading up to day 1 of my cycle and then. Then the next two successful cycles I did a micro-flare protocol where I took Follistim (once a day), Menopur (twice a day) and Lupron.  (twice a day) and a Pregnyl trigger.  For my third and most successful cycle I took Follistim and Menopur once a day and then also Ganarelyx for about 5 days towards the end of my cycle and was triggered with Pregnyl.  Please keep in mind that in order to even do the 3 full cycles and retrievals I had about 3 cancelled cycles. I’m still in the process of my treatment so I haven’t had any protocols performed yet.Most of our cycles went as planned. For some reason clomid and injectibles only got us 1 egg follicle each time which was a bummer. Twice we needed to slow down ovulation with ganirelex due to cultural restrictions. With unexplained infertility and no male factor issues we haven't gotten pregnant yet. Dr. Klein suggested ivf for our case but we pushed off a little bit.Dr. Guarnaccia was the per diem performing my retrieval, the most crucial part of the process.  He was not part of that process. I was unaware he would perform the surgery on me.  12 eggs were retrieve and only 5 were frozen.  All I know is that this was an unexpected result and that I got infected under his care. Also, had extra anti-coagulant shots to take during the hormone treatment because of my blood disorder.Follistim 375 iu Menopur 2-3 vials/day cetrotide 4-5 shots, and ovidril trigger shotStimulation occurred over 9 days, with extraction on the 10th day. 1 vial of menupur throughout stimulation. I started with 225 units of Follistim, but it was reduced, as my follicles were growing quite quickly. Can't remember which trigger shot was used. There was logic to which one he wanted me to take, but I can't recall what it was. I have PCOS so I wasn't on the shots for very long - maybe a week and a half before they triggered with Lupron.  I prefer not to get into specifics.  But one thing i knew is that he always remembered everything of my history and every strategy he used was carefully thought about. One thing that stands out is how I was not responding well to injectables and had to continue taking them longer than the expected time. Dr Klein kept a close watch every step of the way to ensure that we scheduled the IUI at the most optimal time, and not have too many viable eggs available, which he warned could result in a higher chance of multiples. 
I took Gonal F and medipur for the first 12 days of my cycle, and then two more drugs to help with ovulation before my eggs were retrieved. Antagonist protocol.  225 Follistim + 150 Menopur + Ganirelix + Lupron trigger.  I think I over responded to the medication as my estrogen levels rose very quickly and very high. Dr. Klein adjusted my original trigger from Ovidrel to Lupron to prevent OHSS.  The shots were a bit uncomfortable for me, probably because I am on the thinner side. 12 eggs were retrieved and 10 mature eggs were frozen.  I was informed this was a great result for my age.  So before we started iui we were put on 2 rounds of clomid from my obgyn... once those 2 cycles failed we started seeing dr klein
Iui #1- clomid 100 mg - ovidrell we got pregnant and had a miscarriage at 6 weeks- 3 follicles 
Iui #2 clomid 100 mg- day 3-7 ovidrell failed cycle- 2 follicles
Iui #3 clomid 100 mg days 3-7-ovidrell failed cycle - 2 follicles 
Iui #4 letrozol 100mg days 3-7 ovidrell,failed cycle- 3 follicles
Iui #5 letrozole 150 mg days 3-7 , ovidrell-failed iui- 2 follicles
Iui #6 injectables gonal f 75 units monitoring, ovidrell ,failed iui 3follicles 
Iui #7 gonal f 85 units monitoring ovidrell- 4 follicles- waiting for results

My husbands sperm count was lower in the beginning and the mortality wasn't too great... the last 2 cycles has improved. Dr. Guarnaccia used a chart to determine the correct dosage for my egg retrieval medications based on my blood test and ultra sound results. He assured me that I was in the 95 percentile for my age so I am getting the lowest dose of hormones, which I appreciate. I went through 3 rounds of egg freezing, one cancellation, and will be doing one more before being the IUI process with Dr. Klein.  In all three rounds, the Folistim amounts were increased from the start and I was given three different trigger drugs.  My body reacts best to higher doses of Folistim but I also had a canceled cycle on the highest dose.Given my AMH levels Doctor Maslow tailored my fertility drugs to fit my needs.They give me the dose is medium. Follistim 225 unites and 2 vials of Menopur per day. I only injected 8 days to get it ready for retraival. They expected to get 10-15 eggs, I got 13 mature eggs, which is pretty good. Although I expected 15. IVF -- Menopur & Follistim.
I don’t rememberWe agreed to do 2 cycles of egg retrieval (I am 40) and we would determine if a third is necessary.  After the 2nd, we agreed to a 3rd but she was confident that completing a 4th cycle was unnecessary.  Menopur, follastim, ganireix, pregnyl. Side effects: bloating and injection site tenderness. I produced 9 mature eggs, of which 7 were considered apt for freezing.
The process entailed many blood tests and ultrasounds to insure the optimum outcome and my well being I injected myself with hormones and I was monitored very closely dr Klein and his staff were always available for me through email or a phone callfirst IVF protocol was ""micro- flare"" which resulted in ""funky"" egg behavior.
The next cycle was antagonist with high dosage of Gonal- F
and 3rd and most successful cycle was antagonist with lower dosage of Gonal- F which resulted in better egg quality. 
Hysteroscopy to diagnose and remove scarring. Letrozole and Estrogen to bulk up my lining.  PIO, oral & vaginal progesterone before and after FETDr. Klein does lean towards single embryo transfer since there is always the chance it may split and result in twins he rather not take the chance of then possibly having triplets or more Dr. Klein was not a fan of transferring multiple embryos but would have agreed if I begged enough Haven't done ivf yet but I know Dr. Klein is not one for multiples as he's made it clear many times.I very much wanted twins when we discussed IVF as a possibility, and Dr Klein explained the downsides very well and after his explanation I do not believe it is something I’d opt for moving forward. We have not started the ivf process so I am not sureI only have one embryo to transfer, but he said he did not like to risk losing multiple embryos in one shot, along with the risk of multiples.
I didn’t have this procedure never discussed multiple I only did egg freezing This does not apply to me. I am seeing Dr. Maslow for egg freezing.",9.200000000000001,8.400000000000002,"Although I do not remember the specific medications, I do remember feeling pretty decent throughout stimulation.

54,Extend Fertility,cost,"Egg retrieval about $5k and medications averaged between $3k-$7k. Storage is $475 per year.The cost of the office portion was $5,500 for the egg freezing cycle and the medications were extra.Compared to other clinics they are significantly cheaper - and very transparent about costs. No surprises.  Medications cost me even less than they projected. It was well under the rates at other clinics. very fairly priced (compared to other clinics)I got lucky and they were doing a special discount for the month that I was going to begin so I got $1,000 off for all of the stuff associated with retrieval, except for medication and storage. The most affordable I could find, without reducing quality. Conservatively estimating, I saved $10k per cycle, or $50k over the course of five cycles compared to my local options. 695 clomid/letrozol cycle (not including meds)
1350 injectible cycle ( not including meds)
200 iui $6500 for retrieval, $2000 for 5 years of freezing and  approx $2000 in hormones8,500 totalStimulation - $4990
Medication - $3052Dr Klein did not accept insurance when I was a patient. But my insurance had zero infertility coverage. Since I had to pay out of pocket regardless of who I saw, he was my first choice and priced well compared to other doctors.$4990 for a minimum of 12 eggs and up to four egg freezing cycles, depending on your AMH level. About $3500 for meds.Each cycle I believe is $1200... although to some ppl this doesn't sound like much but after 7 iuis it really adds up, and this doesn't include the cost for the medication... gonal f, ovidrell( $100) and tovthink of ivf is scary knowing the price.

Although our dr is definetly good he works with us when it comes to payments approx. $6.5 k for the procedure, $4.5K for ten years of storage. $2.5K goes directly to pharmacy (this is the lowest dosage of hormones. They get more expensive as the amounts go up).... Overall, I think this is cheaper than the big NYC hospitals. $9000 for 4 egg freezing cycles
$2000 for 5 years of long term storage$5,500 for the procedure, $2,000 for the drugs and $2,400 for a 5 year storage planThey are about half as much as other clinics, and they are also very clear in advance. I previously did IUI cycles at another clinic and they ended up costing about three times what I was told to expect. There were no surprises with Expect.
Don’t remember 5000 a cycle for egg retrieval.  Meds were covered under my insurance $5000 for the egg retrieval. Medication was $3000 at the pharmacy.I was fortunate enough to have the vast majority covered by insurance (united & cigna)I remember $5k for 2 egg freezing cycles (doesn’t include medications). I can’t remember IUI or IVF. Cycles were $5200 for the first and $4000 for any cycles performed after that.  I don't recall the costs of all the medications but that differs for everyone.Freezing = 5500
Storage = 2000
Meds = 2169 (I was able to use my friend's leftover hormone meds so saved around $400)
Total = $9669I had one fee that paid for the whole cycle, I thought it was very affordable.The costs to consider were the medications, the procedure fees and the storage fees.  There is a $6000 cycle fee, plus the cost of medications and long-term storage.They had plans based on your blood work and age.  I paid $8050 for 3 cycles or 15 eggs whichever came first.  I then had to pay $450 for storage and for medications.  I got lucky and only had to pay for copays since my insurance covered most of the meds.  My total medication cost for 2 cycles was $900W extend, you pay around $5K. When I shopped around, it would have cost me at least $2K more to do it at a ""normal"" clinic. I paid $4990 for the cycle. This includes everything except, lab work, storage and medications.

56,RMA of New Jersey,doctor,"In addition to highly specific diagnosis and treatment program that Dr. Franasiak provided, he was realistic about what the outcomes could be at every stage, and was incredibly kind during every interaction. We always looked forward to seeing him.

As far as specific outcomes with Dr. Franasiak and RMA Marlton, they were overwhelmingly positive. For example, with previous clinics, after multiple IVF retrievals, we were only able to produce one PGS normal embryo. For my age at the time (37), this was unusual. Prior clinics gave no explanation, they would just tell us to keep doing retrievals, which was emotionally and financially exhausting. We only needed one round of IVF with Dr. Franasiak, as he made our protocol highly personalized. After just one round, we had FOUR PGS normal embryos. I still remember getting the call, I was in shock and cried about the good news.

Similarly, treatment from previous clinics - including years of IUI, IVF, and random surgeries - had never resulted in a clinical pregnancy (only a life threatening ectopic). Previous doctors said I had ""implantation failure"" and never tested me or gave a reason why. Dr. Franasiak looked into the reasons why I hadn't had implantation in my uterus, and tested me for both endometriosis and chronic endometritus. My results were positive for both. After treating the endometriosis and endometritus, we did our first frozen embryo transfer with Dr. Franasiak, and now I'm overjoyed to be 18-weeks pregnant with our first child due in June. 

We have recommended Dr. Franasiak and RMA Marlton to all of our friends with fertility issues, and we'll be returning for baby #2 when we're ready.
I felt heard and supported under is care. I felt that my case was important and urgent and i felt my concerns were heard and validated.  I can recall at least two phone calls where Dr Kaser spent a long time going in to detail with me about specifics of my case and the procedures I had to undergo. Dr. Maguire is completely trustworthy in her explanations and changes to treatment plans. I know I’m in good hands and there is this unspoken sense that she wants me to be successful as much as I do. Dr. Werner is very kind, knowledgeable and professional. She gave us all the options when we came to her for consultation. She answered all my questions and never rushed us into making any decisions. So far I have gone through one IUI and one egg retrieval with Dr. Werner and we have 5 embroys ready to be transfered!We came to Dr. Yih because our previous doctor, Dr. Kaser, moved to California. We have embryos from our previous IVF round and were looking for someone to manage our upcoming embryo transfer. Dr. Yih was very flexible in scheduling our consultation appointment due to our work schedule and distance we needed to travel. During our appointment she was very kind and thorough. She reviewed our medical history and explained what the next steps could look like. We left feeling very comfortable and well informed.Absolutely predatory, careless, checked out, cold, no compassion. A factory farm for IVF clinics. He said he would check in with my OBGYN and other doctors and he did not. Infect they were unable to be in touch with him too. - I understand fertility IQ only checks negative reviews. Which is very upsetting because I feel after this I’ve found other negative experiences with him from other sources. I wish that negative reviews were as welcomes as the positive reviews . I wouldn’t have waisted a round of IVF with them. The very short answer is Dr. Chu is smart and friendly, IF and when you get to speak with her. But don't count on the warm and fuzzies or feeling like someone cares about you. She has great schooling and credentials. I didn't feel a sincere concern from her. I don't want to be mean but she was very detached from my care. I didn't feel she was creative and curtailing therapy specifically to me. I felt RMANJ had therapy protocols and I fell into one bucket and was prescribed the meds for that bucket. She didn't take genuine interest in me as an individual and curtailing therapy to me specifically. I was a number. I felt a little bit of care after a few failed cycles but I honestly don't know if it was ""me"" as an individual that she cared about or that she was disappointed she wasn't successful in her care.Dr Shefali Shastri is compassionate and has a great positive energy. If she would perform all treatments for her patients, I would give her 10 out of 10. But because other doctors perform the treatments, I gave 8 out of 10.Dr. C truly has my best interests at heart and really takes my opinions into consideration. She is compassionate and empathetic. I trust her opinion in what treatment options she suggests.  I know she works her hardest for me to have the best possible outcome. Dr. Shastri is hopeful but realistic. She was honest with us from the beginning and makes you feel like she is going to do everything in her power to get us to where we want to be. Throughout our journey (which we are still on) she would take the time to explain all of our options, answer questions and give us her option. Dr Rauch was extremely patient and understanding. She was empathetic and celebrated my successes as if they were her own. She was gracious and caring. I felt like I could ask her anything and she always gave me an honest response. Dr Rauch was hopeful that i would become
Pregnant and deliver a healthy baby. We did an egg retrieval, PGS testing, and transferred 1 normal embryo. I’m currently 24 weeks pregnant and having a great experience thus far. She’s super nice and funny. She’s very thorough and happy to answer all questions. I didn’t get that experience from another doctor I consulted with at another clinic at all. I’ve always had full trust in Dr. Chu and her decisions during the IVF process. Dr. C has an excellent bedside manner; she’s compassionate and obviously cares a lot about her patients, but she also doesn’t blow smoke up your ass! She’s been very blunt about her opinions regarding our treatment outcome, and didn’t hesitate to say she wasn’t sure about some things. She also didn’t oversell RMA’s capabilities vs our old clinic, which made me trust her even more.I only saw her twice during my treatment she was nice. She gave me hope but things didn't turn out how she thought they would. I was given no explanation as to why most of my embryos didn't make it. Just simply that they didn't.Dr. Molinaro came highly recommended from several women I knew that had gone to him and had success. However all of them had insurance coverage.  He had much more compassion and better bedside manner than the doctor I saw prior to him, but he was almost twice the cost for me without insurance. He did explain, in a way he can’t work miracles and can only work with what I bring him and given the 3 cycles I had at dr before him being a low responder, he couldn’t guarantee anything. He advised us that our money might be better spent with donor eggs, but we wanted to try one cycle with my own eggs with him. And he said he was willing to help us do that, but we didn’t have very high odds. About 15% chance. Verses 60% chance with donor eggs. I have had a wonderful experience with Dr. Costantini thus far. She’s extremely thorough, knowledgeable, and patient. My husband and i had a lot of questions and she never made us feel rushed and was very patient even when we may have repeated ourselves. I admire her confidence when telling us what approach she believe would be best for us. She doesn’t sugar coat things but at the same time has excellent bedside manner. I truly believe that she is the best at what she does. Dr. Kaser is very patient and kind.l had a lot of questions for him and he was able to answer all of them during our appointment.  He performed my saline sonogram and my initial consult sonogram. He walked me through the whole IVF process then circled back to my immediate next steps.He’s calm and positive and very respectful of the patient. He genuinely cares about your situation and takes the time to talk you through each step. When things don’t turn out as expected he calls to console the patient and help plan for the future cycles and discusses how he will adjust for next round. He doesn’t have an ego which many doctors do have he listens to the patients requests and makes sure you feel 100% comfortable with each step of the process. Starting with our initial consult, Dr. Franasiak made us feel like more than a number, and like actual people. He had great bed-side manner, yet was always up front with us in regards to what we were facing with Secondary Unexplained Infertility. He was always understanding of our feelings, and justified our frustrations with the lack of answers the tests/treatments/results were able to provide. When we decided it was best for me to take a break from treatments, we had a discussion with Dr. Frasnasiak about same. He reassured us that everything was done by all parties in an effort to conceive a baby, and that all progressed ""as it should."" He also stated that if we felt it was in my best interest to take some time to ourselves, it was understandable and that if we ever decide to continue with treatment, he will be there to assist us.

Although the three treatment (IUI) cycles we went through did not result in a pregnancy, my husband and I were very glad that we chose Dr. Franasiak at RMA, and that they were a part of our journey. We highly recommend him to anyone in the area trying to conceive a baby!He is very compassionate, well educated,  and has great bed side manner. He made me feel so comfortable with everything and gave me a sense of confidence that everything was going to work out well. He explained everything to great extent and made sure I understood each process. Dr. Bergh gave me hope for fertility preservation after cancer, even while being honest about my limited chances. He clearly explained each part of the process and what it meant for my future. He brought compassion and humor when my news wasn’t what I was hoping for and helped me navigate my next steps. I love that when I go to see Dr. Molinaro that he tells me the next steps right there- I don't feel like I have to wait for him to make a decision. We've had a few setbacks but he's called to check-in and offer support every time and I can ask him about different options to try and trust that he knows exactly what to do to make sure that we get over the finish line. I've already recommended him to two friends.Dr Bergh was very candid with me and told me ""how it was"".  He didn't sidestep anything because it was uncomfortable, he just said it in a blunt yet respectful manner.  After I had a bad reaction to the medicine the first round, he worked with me to figure out a plan and continues to do so afterwards.  Dr Kasee is a great listener.  He reviews all my records prior to meeting with me and always shows up prepared.  He is a great colloborator. My situation is complicated because both my partner and I are healthy, no issues, except my age of 39.  I received medical advice from an infertility specialist through a 3rd party program.  Dr Kaser reviewed my report with me and incoporated some of the protocol in my cycle.  He's also collaborated with other doctors at RMA on my case to have a second set of eyes assist with a very complicated case.I had never had a male doctor before Doctor Doherty. He made my husband and I feel comfortable right from the first visit. He reviewed our results with us thoroughly, explained what steps we would take, and what each step entailed. He made changes as needed throughout each treatment and really seemed to study our case. He was very positive every time we met with him and made me feel hopeful. Dr. Franasiak is caring and gentle. He uses the best available evidence to assist him in his decisions and is willing to research for additional treatments that may assist pregnancy. He is thoughtful and I believe he is making the best decisions ossible with regards to my needs and my care Dr. Rybak is a very kind and knowledgeable person. He seemed to really care and exuded  positive energy. He makes the patient feel comfortable and hopeful that their experience will be a success. He asks a lot of questions and is thorough in his answers. He presents as very invested in his patients and is extremely compassionate.I really liked Dr. Fischer as my doctor. She was warm, patient, reassuring, and supportive. The only question I had was whether her lack of experience was going to impact anything (she only recently started practicing). But in terms of bedside manner, she was wonderful. Dr. Molinaro had a great bedside manner and positive attitude. IVF is a difficult journey and he made it all much easier. He was also very realistic - yet very tactful when setting expectations. He answered all my questions promptly and was great at explaining the more ""technical"" aspects of the treatment in a way I could easily understand. 
I came to RMANJ after poor results at another clinic. Dr. Molinaro put me on a stimulation protocol that worked much better. After two stimulation cycles and a frozen transfer I got pregnant and delivered a healthy baby.  Talking to and working with Dr. Costantini made us feel like we were finally heading in the right direction! The knowledge and obvious experience, as well as the bed side manner, was such a relief. Especially after seeing another doctor who did not have a similar approach. I always liked to know exactly what was going on-levels, numbers, the result each medication would achieve, etc. I think it helped me to feel partially in control of a situation that we had no control over. She was empathetic to that, and that made me feel most comfortable. You can tell she's a mom in her caring approach!Dr. Catha Fischer was always speaking to me as if my IVF was going to work, she would always re-assure me that everything will be ok, she said in the end, I will have a beautiful family and she was right! Dr Chu ultimately recommended that I have my fibroid surgically removed before doing any embryo transfer. She does not perform this surgery herself, so she referred me to another provider for this. I did not feel comfortable undergoing this surgery therefore I decided to get a second opinion.Dr. Leo was compassionate and understanding always. There were days where I was so upset and I did feel like a few times I took it out on him he did nothing but calm me down and do his best to make sure everything was ok, I am still in shock of the fact that I graduated last week!My husband and I were referred to Dr. Molinaro (Dr. M) by a friend that had nothing but amazing things to say.  From the moment we met Dr. M we knew he was the doctor for us and from that moment he never let us down.  The fertility journey is a rollercoaster of emotions and thanks to Dr. M we didn’t have to navigate that journey on our own. He was there with us every step of the way explaining everything in detail and treating us with compassion, understanding and patience.   Going through this process you need a doctor who not only knows the field and best course of treatment for you but who also listens and hears  you and understands how difficult and emotional  each decision and step  can be and Dr. M is that doctor.  I couldn’t say enough amazing things about him.  My husband and I are forever thankful to him.  During my first round at RMA (which was very straightforward and successful), I was treated by another doctor who has since left.  However, Dr. Hong did my HSG and my retrieval, both of which I was incredibly nervous for.  When I returned to RMA several years later for my second child, I requested to see Dr. Hong because of the compassion she showed me and the warmth and friendliness of her approach.  Dr.  Hong is very bright and quick thinking, yet she also takes the time to get to know you personally.  After a disappointing miscarriage, she was so reassuring and generous with her time.  She changed the approach and made sure to personally perform my transfer.  The amount of times she went out of her way to connect with me and attend to my concerns was what made her stand out in my mind. Dr. Drews was very knowledgeable and was kind even though he did not have a great bedside manner. He was confident which made me feel positive.  However, he also didn't seem to have time for me and did not do any follow up. I basically didn't see or hear from him after my initial visit, one subsequent visit and the HSG.Dr Chu was very informative but not always the most compassionate. After my 1st failed IUI with her (3rd failed overall at that point) I asked about changing medications or protocols and she did not find it necessary. After my next IUI with her failed, I again asked from a change or if we could do some more diagnostics and was finally heard and repeat labs were drawn. We increased my dose of gonal-f the next round but still were not successful.  I do not have IVF coverage but still after each failed IUI, I was asked if I wanted to move forward with IVF. I felt this was a little insensitive. I was not offered any other diagnostics or protocols other than just moving on to IVF.Dr. Jurema was very caring, but RMA is huge so I only saw/talked with him a few times and was assigned a nurse who I spoke to much more frequently.  Dr. Jurema was willing to try a few options my previous doctor wasn't such as ERA test which showed I needed more exposure to progesterone.  Unfortunately even those additional things didn't prevent us from having another miscarriage and we moved on to a reproductive immunologist who could help us with recurrent losses.He was a nice doctor. He knew what steps and procedures I needed in order for me to have a successful IVF cycle process. He knew what medications I needed to take in order to increase my chances of getting pregnant with less chances of having a miscarriage.Dr. Werner was very compassionate, knowledgeable and professional.  She was always very thorough when laying out options and treatment plans and never pushed me in any direction - she always told me she would support my choices.  She made it easy for me to make the decisions that were right for me.  She was always checking in on how I was feeling and never made me feel rushed or unimportant.  Her bedside manner is incredible - she genuinely took setbacks as hard as I did.  I felt like she really fought for me throughout the process.I saw him only at the beginning of each cycle, as well as when one embryo miscarried.  He was compassionate throughout.  It was always clear that he was the guiding force behind all the decisions.  All decisions were made by him, even if he didn't see me and was using other doctor's notes to make those informed decisions.   My actual meeting with him was lengthy and comprehensive, and I felt listened to.She seemed caring and she always discussed her plan in terms of research. She tried to provide honest recommendations based on my situation.  She doesn't really take a holistic approach. There was some information that she could have provided earlier in the process that could have helped my outcome.Dr. Hong is very approachable and easy to talk with. She was very helpful in explaining everything and taking the time to answer our questions until we were satisfied. She comes across to me as very research/fact based and practical, which is why I think we immediately liked working with her. She has a lot of energy, but is also caring and sensitive. I appreciate the ability to be able to speak with her directly on the phone even in between appointments. Our treatment plan changed a few times and she proactively called me to explain the rationale behind each decision. She performed almost all of my monitoring visits and also performed my embryo transfer. I always felt in good hands, both clinically and compassion-wise. Dr Morris made us feel like we were her only patients, it was always a very personal experience. When we first began the fertility process we were nervous and unsure what to expect, we chose Dr Morris because her RMA video was very relatable and we were not disappointed. While she is very direct and to the point she managed to do it in a way with such compassion. Her staff was the same way, when we graduated from RMA back to our regular doctor I remember feeling a bit sad because we would miss dealing with her and her team. As we look to have our second we wouldn’t hesitate for a minute going back to RMA with Dr MorrisDr. Kaser was wonderful in every way. He diagnosed me with PCOS after two previous doctors had missed this. Once my infertility was treated using an appropriate intervention for PCOS I got the result I had hoped for. Dr. Kaser went above and beyond in all regards showing true compassion and concern. He answered all my questions thoroughly. Working with him was such a pleasure that my husband even commented that he wished Dr. Kaser could deliver our baby as well. Dr Chu, so far, has been great.  I appreciate her candor. Although, I wish I could get  ahold of her directly verses having to call my nurse, wait for a response then speak through the nurse. But, that’s RMA’s policy not the doctor’s.My experience with RMA and Dr. Molinaro was exactly what I was looking for after settling for less at other clinics and with other doctors. One thing that immediately stood out to me was that he was reachable. He gave us his direct email address, which may seem like a small thing but for us this was very different than what we experienced at other clinics. Dr. Molinaro has a lot of confidence in his clinic and in their protocols but he was always patient with answering my questions and listening to my concerns. I am someone who wants to understand everything that's going (so that I can then let go and trust the process) so it was helpful that he was willing to answer questions and talk through things. It's clear to me that he really wants his patients to feel both physically and emotionally healthy. On my first day he sat me down and did a detailed history. I thought I was prepared had all my background and thoughts written down but he didn’t went deeper than that and I was shocked I forgot important stuff. Luckily I wasn’t on my 3rd cycle day so he set me up right there with all the testing I needed and performed the ultrasound. He talked to me about what he found what he expects and what will happen after all the initial tests come back. I am high risk because of my age and medicine I am on so he referred me to a MFM doctor who he personally worked with to help with the process. He is thorough and realistic. Dr. Drew’s is highly intelligent and truly cares about the outcome of his patients treatment plan. I found him to be very knowledgeable during our consultation and I found his treatment plans to fall in line with what he stated during the consultation. I like that he took a different approach after the first transfer didn’t work. We are in the process of setting up our second transfer so we will see what the outcome is this next time around. Kathleen Hong is one of the most professional and warmest doctors I have ever come across. Women coming to her are at some of the lowest points in there lives (I know I was), but she was comforting yet professional, clear without being cold or insensitive and encouraging without giving you false hope. I cried a few times during initial consults, but she slid tissues over and kept talking and reassuring us we would have our baby one day. I was so happy my tears wasn't made into a ""thing"". Three years later and I'm ready for baby #2. And I was SO nervous to do this all again. But after our first meeting I remembered how and why I got through it the first time. IT WAS HER. She is absolutely AMAZING. We began treatment with Dr. Molinaro after several failed rounds of IUIs and IVF with another doctor. We were looking for someone who was going to be aggressive with our treatment and willing to take risks which Dr. Molinaro was. We really felt like he tailored our treatment plan to fit us and our needs. Dr. Molinaro pays attention to detail, is up-to-date on the latest research and procedures and takes each treatment step-by-step so as not to overwhelm you.Dr. Morris is a great doctor. We did not get pregnant with our transfer, however, I was comfortable with our process. We were successful with our first cycle 2 years ago, and my husband and I (and Dr. Morris) were comfortable going through the same process. 
Dr. Morris is extremely sympathetic and compassionate. She is straightforward and answers every question with intellect and professionalism. She is also very down-to-earth and makes you feel comfortable.The main issue I had with IVF was coming up with the money.  Dr. Morris understood and never pressured me to start IVF.  It took 2 years to be able to save enough for the egg retrieval and Dr. Morris answered my numerous questions over that entire time.  She knew I liked to know every detail and every scenario possible and was patient and kind with me.  Dr. Morris did a lot of my morning monitoring and always had a smile and often a hug if I needed one.  I think if we met under different circumstances we could definitely be friends. I might not have seen her every time but she worked a long an amazing nurse who would call me all the time and at any point I felt that the nurse could not answer my question she would call me back within a few hours.  She was there trying to figure out the best plan and the safest way to get me pregnant.  She was able to explain in understandable terms what was happening as well as what the next steps would be.  At the end of my treatment I loved her so much I made her come out of a meeting and we both hug as we said good bye!Dr M explains things very simply. He made sure me and my husband understood everything. He kept very positive but realistic expectations. He never got ahead of where we were in the process, but did outline possible treatment plans. I wish I got to see him more often, as I mostly see other doctors for my monitoring and even my first round of IUI.  The first visit, Dr. Hong took time to understand what cancer treatments I had going on, and helped figure out the timeline for my fertility preservation. She outlined a timeline for me and gave me all of the pertinent information with colorful coding, complete with drawings and explanations. She continued to follow up with me and reached out to me continuously to address my concerns.I really like Dr. Werner, she has been a big part of our journey.  I feel grateful that we had the opportunity to have her as our doctor.  Somehow her calming voice has always put my nerves at ease even during difficult times. As mentioned previously, his bedside manner and approachability are two of Dr. Molinaro’s strengths.  He is easily accessible for questions by phone, via email, and to meet when necessary.  Furthermore, he takes ownership over his prescribed treatment and is willing to make adjustments when things don’t work as expected. The only setback is that we have not been pregnant just yet.  He remains positive that we will be successful, so I’m optimistic to continue treatment and look forward to giving it another shot with my next transfer.Dr. Rybak is compassionate, caring, loving and much more than just a doctor.  He genuinely cares about me as a patient.  He is always honest and never provides false hope or expectations.  He cares about how I am doing along in the process and wants to ensure that his treatment plans are not just what he proposes but that we are in agreement.Dr. Shastri (Mavani) has been my RE for the last two years. I've gone through three failed transfers after two hysteroscopies to get a fibroid and one laparascopy to remove my non functional tube. After going through all of the physical issues, we thought we were in the clear. Unfortunately, I had my third failed transfer at the end of June to no avail. The day of the beta, she left me a voicemail almost in tears and then the following Monday, sat with me for an hour and a half to discuss next steps. She hasnt been successful getting me pregnant just yet, but I have the absolute faith that it is coming.She’s is a great communicator, kind, compassionate, intelligent and very thorough. She always insisted that we give her a call whenever we had any questions. She didn’t take any risks and always made sure I was doing what was best for our chances and for me as an individual women going through this process.Dr Yih was very nice and knowledgeable.  she always was forthcoming with information and answered our questions.  She was usually easy to get a hold of if needed but sometimes I felt like she thought we were a lost cause and not given the same attention as younger patients.  Time is not on our side and she pretty much told us that too.  I am a very optimistic person and always kept telling myself that this is possible even though times she acted like we were out of our league. Dr. Franasiak has been pleasant, candid and thorough since my first visit.  He explained the details of the treatment options, answered all of my questions and even provided guidance and support through the more emotional side of this journey.Dr. Treiser was very warm and compassionate, listened to my concerns and answered all of my questions. She was great and so supportive throughout the whole process. I started out with another doctor (who since retired) and worked with her moving forward. I chose her specifically because she was the one who ended up doing my transfer. I loved her and her personality, and just felt like she would be the right doctor moving forward. Dr. Hong is a very patient and sympathetic doctor.  She always took the time to listen and answer my questions and concerns.  I feel like I was always being heard and supported by her.  When I didn’t get the results I was hoping for, she would aknowledge my struggles.Doctor is very friendly, warm and compassionate. Patient in answering all questions. Balances patient needs and wants with what is safe from a medical standpoint. I saw her for my first IVF pregnancy and live birth and chose her in a heartbeat to start next IVF cycke for baby #2.I am so glad to have found her. I am really happy with Dr. Shastri's care. She is well-versed in the literature but does not treat me like a number. I was referred to her by one of the docs that had trained her as a fellow - someone that has an excellent reputation and to whom I would go for treatment if my insurance covered it. Dr. Doherty is one of the best doctors I have ever had. I knew that I had found the right doctor after our initial consultation when he spent close to an hour walking me and my husband through the process of IVF from start to finish and answering all of our questions. Since then I have had several appointments and phone conversations with Dr. Doherty and he always takes the time to answer all of my questions without making me feel rushed. 

Dealing with an infertility diagnosis can be very stressful and overwhelming but Dr. Doherty made it much easier through his compassion and calming demeanor. It is clear that he cares about all of his patients and genuinely wants to help them succeed. For example, after learning that I had limited insurance coverage, he immediately helped me to get into programs that would cover part of my treatment. I am a genetic carrier for fragile x syndrome. My ovarian reserve is extremely low. Going through three cycles in less than a year and a half was extremely emotionally and financially taxing. Dr rybak took away all the fears that comes along with IVF and PGD. He explained procedures well, during retrievals and transfers he was always calm warm and smiling. He made us feel comfortable by speaking to us not at us. A big plus was that he is also an Orthodox Jew and addressed all the complicated questions that come about with IVF. Wether a procedure fell out over the sabbath or holiday or how to get the proper supervision. He always was able to direct us properly. Something he did that really touched us before he transferred to of my frozen eggs he paused and said a meaningful prayer it meant the world to us. I see how he deals with patients of all religions and races and he treats us all the same. His compassion and love for helping bringing new souls into this world means everything to himDr Hong was excellent. She had a good bedside manner but was direct which was appreciated. She took stances and explained what informed her decisions. She gave us excellent recommendations that really considered our circumstances. She informed us of risks but ultimately showed confident decision making. She appears to be very evidence based, in her thought process. Doesn't try many, what if approaches. So if you are looking for someone who will try the kitchen sink method, she is not for you. She is willing to try alternative approaches, but doesn't offer them. When I wanted to try something new, she was willing, but didn't think it would change my outcome. Exceptional communication and knowledge.  Invites questions and even draws figures to explain in visual representation the issues we are encountering.  Makes sure we are comfortable and understand each stage before we proceed.  He is also an excellent, skilled surgeon and I had no complications from my hysteroscopic polypectomy.She is warm and personable as well as knowledgeable. Unfortunately after our first appointment I didn’t feel like we had an opportunity to talk strategy and most of the information I got seemed be on a “need to know” basis or I came with questions but the process is complicated and could use some more detailed explaining along the way. Dr. Maguire is kind, patient, and will spend the time talking out all the different recommendations. She shows compassion and hasn’t given up on me. When I first started I was deemed a really easy case and got pregnant the first round but it ended in a missed miscarriage just before the first trimester was about to end and it was with a chromosomally normal embryo. I then went on to have a failed transfer and then an ectopic (which no one ever explained was possible through IVF). The doctors also do not believe in reproductive immunology.Jamie Morris was very knowledgeable and did a good job with clearly and succinctly summarizing all of our treatment options, as well as summarized clearly all of the results of our fertility tests. When she performed my IUI procedure, she performed it very quickly and painlessly, which I appreciated. I think I could have benefitted from a little more time spent during our appointments, they always felt a bit rushed. After the IUI procedure, she walked out very quickly, with little explanation on next steps and instructions for me. Dr. Kaser is the best doctor I have ever had and though this was a difficult journey, he made me feel cared for and supported throughout.  I never felt he was giving up hope and that is what kept me strong and positive.  He was great at communicating and explaining what was happening and what to expect.  He was encouraging and caring and really made me feel special - not like just another patient.  He was extremely competent and knew how to answer all my questions.  I felt comfortable with him through every procedure.  When things didn't go well he took the time to call me himself and explain in detail and listen to my concerns.Dr Molinaro made this experience so much better than we could have anticipated.  He clearly communicated with us to help set goals, define our plan, and answer any and all questions we had.  I felt he was always accessible if I needed to ask a question or had a concern.  His positive attitude and honesty allowed us to trust him and this process, and we can’t imagine going through this without anyone else.  I like how she was honest. We already had our diagnosis going into consultation. We saw her as a second opinion and ending up choosing her for treatment. Both doctors recommended the same course of treatment. However, I felt she had more experience and preferred this clinic to the other one. So far I am very comfortable with him as my doctor. I feel positive about the situation. We crafted a plan that works with my budget and my life at the moment. While i have been told that I would likely do very well with ivf, finances are preventing me from going that route. Dr Rybak, 

Did not make me feel like a loss cause. I feel going through ivf can make people feel like an outcast or a nebach. Dr. Rybak felt our pain but also encouraged us that we are doing the right thing. 

He wants to make sure all my procedures and test are up to date and checking in with my nurse I can’t say many other doctors feel this way about their patients He is the most warm, compassionate and caring doctor I have ever met. He remembers every detail from visit to visit, and although I didn’t see him each visit I felt totally comfortable and trusted him 100% in directing and overseeing my care. I don’t have anything negative to say about the doctor himselfI love dr Hong.  She has been amazing.  Calling me on weekends while she is out of town.  Taking extra time to explain exactly what I can expect. I had a really rough 2nd egg retrieval.  She called to check on me herself.  She is caring and sweet.  After the egg retrieval I was in a lot of pain.  I could tell she cared and felt bad.  I ended up with a hematoma because of the andominal retrieval.  She really wanted the transfer to work for me.  I remember her calling me after I spoke to the nurse hearing the news of my negative beta.  Dr Hong left me a voicemail saying how sorry she was.  She was so sincere and sweet.  I would highly recommend her to a friend or family member.  I was given pretty horrific news before I came to see Dr. Doherty. I was in a place with no hope - but just going thru the motions. I had seen a couple doctors prior to Dr. Doherty and still felt like there wasn't much hope. 

When I came to Dr. Doherty, he was somewhat new to the practice and I didn't have much expectations. But even on that first visit, I felt like he gave me so much hope. There was something about how he went over my options that made me feel optimistic for the first time since I got my devastating news. 

He made no promises but he made me feel like there were lots of options and definitely gave me that hope that I needed. He made me feel like he cared and would be there with me thru my journey. 

He is so kind and always has a smile. I can't really put it into words - but his characteristics are not something that you learn, it's something you ARE. I would highly recommend him to anyone and everyone! I honestly just LOVED him!!!

I am pregnant with my 1st and know that I will be going back to him when we are ready for our 2nd! I have read about other doctors at RMA-NJ trying novel treatments and I'm not sure anything Dr. Treiser is doing in my situation is particularly novel, but then again, it may be that I have not needed anything novel because I am having good success with the current treatment.   Dr. Treiser is easy to talk to and easy to get ahold of and explains everything thoroughly that I ask her about so that I'm not concerned about my questions anymore.I have PCOS and am overweight, Dr. Shastri was very patient for our 1st year of treatment and just kept encouraging me to lose weight.  When we finally got cleared for our first treatment cycle, my mom passed away and a month later my father had open heart bypass surgery. During what was an extremely stressful time, Dr. Shastri was extremely supportive. She has encouraged us to continue healthy lifestyle choices and praises the loss we have achieved.

I liked Dr. Bergh he was candid but professional. He was very thorough but also very invested in getting me pregnant. He discovered that I had Celiac Disease which was a piece of the puzzle no other doctor had found out about me. I enjoyed working with him.Dr Franasiak is an amazing doctor with great bedside manner. He never made me feel uncomfortable or upset given the circumstances. He always inspired hope with me and I always felt like I was in the hands of the absolute BEST.Dr. Jurema is friendly and compassionate. During monitoring meetings he always started by asking how I was feeling, which I appreciated. He's very straightforward - I found his descriptions of what we could expect from various procedures to be detailed and realistic, while also optimistic. It never seemed like he was trying to push me toward a particular procedure. I very much felt like I played a role in my care and was able to get all my questions answered.I really have no complaints about Dr. Doherty. When we disagreed with each other on the donor sperm issue, he reminded me that he was trying to give me the best chance to have a baby. Luckily our intuitions were right and we didn't need donor sperm but I did like the fact that Dr. Doherty reminded jus of our options. He was  always supportive and assisted with any issue I had. He even helped with the issues I had with my insurance company. I couldn't have asked for a better doctor. He's the reason our miracle baby is here today. I had no clue what to expect going to RMA and the first meeting with Dr. Hong reassured me I had made the best decision possible.  She explained the process, what was required, where potential hiccups could happen and of course how the entire RMA staff is there to hand hold my husband and I through everything.  I miscarriaged twice - one at 11 weeks when I had already been cleared by RMA - and I can remember our first conversation about restarting and how sympathetic she was to me - I felt like I was her best friend and she was doing everything in her power to support me.  The second time I saw the same thing and the promise that we would keep going.  She explained how if we tested the embryos it may net a better result - so I did it - without hesitating about the cost - because I 100% trusted her opinion.  After our third transfer, which Dr. Hong made sure she was there for to do v. anyone else, I waited to hear the test results.  March 7, 2017 @ 7:59a I received a voicemail from Dr. Hong telling me the news.  I have yet to delete that voicemail because her positivity, excitement and friendliness still makes me feel warm inside.  She stuck with us through so much bad and on November 16, 2017 we received so much good with the birth of our first child.  She kept me grounded and upbeat and I owe her everything for our daughter.  Looking forward to working with her through the next pregnancy - wouldn't want it any other way.He explained treatment plans.  When our results continued to lead to poor numbers he didn’t change the protocol which I wish he would have. He kept being optimistic that the treatment plan was a good one and that it just might result in success at some point. After 4 cycles of the same we decided to go for another opinion.I felt Dr. Treiser was very candid and forthcoming, and worked with me to find the best way to treat both my infertility and manage my anxiety about the process. I trusted her and felt she absolutely knew what she was doing. I was very happy with her, although she was not my favorite doctor at the Somerset office. Dr. Hong is a very knowledgable physician. She understood, based on my hormone levels and AFC count, that an antagonist protocol with estrogen priming would be best suited to me to obtain optimal results.  We trusted her completely throughout this process.  Dr. Forman is amazing! Nothing bad to say. You can't go wrong with him as your doctor. Very smart and on top of cutting edge research. And excellent bed side manner. A unique combo! Fertility treatment is very stressful, but knowing that your doctor is always available to answer your questions and guide you, makes the process a little less stressful. He truly has your best interest in mind. Other doctors that I have consulted with did not listen to my family planing goals. Dr. Forman listening to my goals and guided us in the best possible way to help us now and in the long term. Dr. Forman is extremely knowledgeable but above all, he is incredibly kind and patient.  He is soft-spoken and remains very calm when I have the tendency to get overly emotional and breakdown in front of him.  I was confident that Dr. Forman knew the best treatment plan for my specific situation.  Dr. Forman is empathetic and compassionate and sincerely cared for how I was feeling during the cycle and after retrieval.  I selfishly wish he wasn't leaving the RMA practice because I would love to continue to be his patient.  There aren't enough kind words to describe him; he's definitely a rare find when it comes to being seen by a fertility doctor who honestly cares about his patients.I have been very happy with Dr. Morris throughout this whole journey. She's very knowledgeable and always willing to answer my questions. She always makes me feel at ease. I couldn't ask for a better Dr.We first met Dr. Forman a few years ago when after TTC for about 3 years on our own. During our first visit with Dr. Forman we were shocked by the amount of information we were given. He was thorough and responsive to any questions we had. At that point in time we were not ready to move forward with treatment due to financial reasons. After switching jobs and moving, my new health insurance covered treatment at another fertility clinic that was much closer to our new home. We made an appointment at the other fertility center and quickly realized that the care was extremely different.

Despite the distance and having to pay out of pocket, we returned to Dr. Forman and never looked back! I was extremely nervous about the entire IVF process, and Dr. Forman eased my concerns and gave me the tools I needed to feel confident about our treatment plan. We completed our retrieval which was extremely successful. We did our first transfer about a month later which did not work. Upon receiving the news, Dr. Forman immediately discussed with us a new plan for our next transfer which we were excited about. There was never a pause in care; Dr. Forman was able to keep us focused on our family planning goals. I'm happy to report our second transfer was successful, and I am now in my second trimester.

We look forward to continuing to grow our family under Dr. Forman's care!!!Dr. Forman was always very calm, reassuring, and extremely knowledgeable.  He never made me feel like a number.  He truly loves what he does and is compassionate.  I never doubted his advice or recommendations and felt very confident that he was my fertility physician.  He always returned my calls or texts very promptly if I had a question or concern which put me at ease.Dr. Jurema is very knowledgeable in his field and took the time to make sure that all of our questions were answered to our satisfaction. Dr. Jurema is very compassionate and empathetic towards his patients. We were most appreciative of the fact that he took the time to contact us directly, instead of through a nurse, to provide us updates on the results of retrieval, fertilization, and embryo progression. We wish all of our doctors, in any profession, were as caring as Dr. Jurema and truly can not say enough positive things about him.From our first meeting with Dr. Doherty we knew we were at the right place with the right doctor. He listened to our concerns and fears and answered all of our questions honestly and professionally. He set up a game plan that we were comfortable with and took it on with confidence. Our first retrieval was successful with 32 eggs retrieved and 3 embryos to freeze. I was thankful to have Dr. Doherty perform my transfer and was ecstatic to get the call from him saying I was pregnant! Unfortunately, at my 6 week ultrasound Dr. Doherty cautioned us that the baby's heartbeat was a bit slow. We came back two days later to find out it was barely there and the growth had stopped. We went back two days after that and saw Dr. Yi for the ultrasound which showed the faintest of heartbeats. Dr. Doherty personally called us that evening to see how we were holding up. That phone call meant the world to us.  After the D&C, testing showed an unbalanced translocation. Since that was my third loss, Dr. Doherty wasted no time and had a karyotype done on us and found that I have a balanced translocation. With that, as relieved as I was to have an answer, I was terrified it was the end of the road for us. Dr. Doherty explained what this meant for us with compassion and was hopeful that with lots of eggs to work with and testing of our embryos, we would get pregnant with a healthy baby. We got ready for another retrieval and were again successful with 45 eggs retrieved this time! Six made it to testing and two were normal. I was again, grateful to have Dr. Doherty perform my second transfer which resulted in a positive pregnancy test! I was terrified that each ultrasound would bring bad news. Dr. Doherty comforted our fears and really helped us get through those first weeks without going insane. If I had a question, he answered it. If I had a concern, he addressed it. It was so bittersweet when we graduated from RMA and Dr. Doherty's care. Happy we made it this far, sad to leave Dr. Doherty and the RMA family that we had come to love. Dr. Hock has been very thorough and laid our our treatment plan at every step. She adjusts the plan after each test and every bit of additional information that we receive. I appreciate her honesty, but she also gives news very clearly and kindly. She is very knowledgeable and also sensitive to our individual wishes as a couple throughout this process.  Dr. Hong helped me understand our course of treatment and what our next steps will be.  I feel confident that we are in good hands.I have nothing but positive things to say about Dr. Molinaro.   After a really terrible consult with another clinic/doctor, Dr Molinaro was a breath of fresh air.  From consult to treatment, Dr. M treated me like a person and I always knew and understood the process and the plan.    Another clinic has diagnosed me as the fertility issue due to a large fibroid and wanted me to have a major surgery before even testing my husband.   Going to RMA and Dr. M, we learned the fibroid wasn't the issue and in fact it was male factor morphology so we moved right to IVF.  Once pregnant, we have a rough couple weeks with concerns of a potential cornual pregnancy and Dr. M was with me every step of the way.   I also loved the collaboration between all the doctors in the practice.  I was sent to see one doctor who was the fibroid expert and saw Dr Bergh during the early pregnancy because he was the best with our problem.  I think it takes a special doctor and team to know whats best for the patient.  Amazing follow-up and bedside manner and just a truly wonderful doctor.   I have a wonderful 10 month old daughter because of him and we will be starting the process for #2 in the next few weeks.  Dr Drews is a compassionate and honest doctor. He does not candy coat but he has a way with sharing information that leaves you feeling as if you are of personal importance to him. He provides relevant information in a professional yet compassionate way. Dr. Shefali Shastri is a very skilled and knowledgeable reproductive endocrinologist. She is realistic in her expectations and explains all diagnosis, procedures, and results throughout treatment. She is kind, caring and compassionate. Dr. Shastri puts her all into her work, and will do all that she can to get a positive result. I would recommend her to anyone who is looking for a great RE.Strengths:  She is very compassionate and takes time to answer questions when you see her in person.
Weaknesses:  She was difficult to get in touch with due to schedule.  Ex:  in office Monday and Tuesday, can't get her by phone other days.  Not very involved in IVF process.  He's a bit of an awkward turtle, but I found that rather comforting.  I like statistics and scientific information and he was always good about providing that.  He has been a very good fit for me.  Since the beginning, he has collaborated with me on treatment and we have talked through the various options both from a likelihood of success perspective as well as a financial (what is and is not covered by insurance) perspective. RMA is amazing. All the of the doctors are so skilled. My nurse, Nicole B. is super caring and responsive to patient needs. I cannot say enough good about Dr. Hong. I recommend her for anyone who is nervous to start and is looking for a guiding hand. Her calm demeanor can make anyone going through this feel ready and supported. RMA is expensive, and they are not compassionate when it comes to multiple cycle costs, not necessarily the Doctor but they don't get involved and honestly they should know. They recommend IVF straight away, and in my case that was not the best course of action. I had more testing that should have been done, to realize it was a waste of $28K. I asked Dr. Jurema if there were more tests we could do after my 3rd miscarriage, and he recommended we do another cycle and just pay for the new advanced testing. I had already done testing and had 1 embryo, this recommendation did not make me feel confident and I changed direction after much research. She has been very up-front about the probabilities of IUI working for us, and when I met with her to discuss IVF, she was very thorough in explaining how it works. I felt that I understood well enough to be able to explain IVF knowledgeably to my husband, who was unable to attend my appointment. As we move to IVF, I look forward to continuing to work with Dr. Shastri.Dr. Forman is very knowledgeable, patient and detail oriented. He cares about his patients and wanted the best for his patients. He always addresses my concern and question. He also made sure he is more hands-on with me once I had one failed transfer. He made sure he did the 2nd transfer for me and made sure he can see me in each morning monitor. I am thankful to have met Dr. Forman. He was committed to our goal of achieving pregnancy throughout our time at RMA.  He came up with creative solutions and explained all of our options thoroughly.  We experienced a number of failures, but Dr. Forman never gave up.  He continued to explore possibilities.
Dr. Forman was thorough, trustworthy, kind, intelligent, caring, compassionate and easily accessible for questions.  He gave us all the time we needed to answer questions.  I highly recommend Dr. Forman!Dr. Forman is extremely knowledgeable and very compassionate. He has a very calm demeanor and takes his time explaining everything to the patient. You can tell he has the best interest of the patient at heart although he may seem somewhat quiet or stand off-ish. He is very respectful of the patient and what she and her husband are going through. Here’s a great communicator and is always available night or day by email. You can feel his passion for his work and his general commitment to the patient. I would highly recommend him.Dr. Kim is very patient, during our first consult, he took time to understand our prior failure with another clinic and the protocol that we followed. He was very honest and forthcoming in answering all our questions/concerns. After our first consult, I had complete faith in his approach and treatment protocol for us. She looks at each person as an individual, she has some out of the box treatment options but is open and honest about the successes. She is caring, and has followed up with me on a regular basis to monitor my progress. I am very happy with her!Dr. Bergh is very knowledgeable and willing to meet with me whenever needed.  He always evaluates my progress and makes my treatment decisions.  He is easy to discuss things with and I feel very comfortable that getting treated by him gives me the best chance for Baby #2.Dr. Foreman is very intelligent. He has a matter-of-fact nature that I appreciated. I don't want a doctor to give me the run-around or take unnecessary steps. Dr. Foreman gets straight to the point and gives his opinion on the best course of action. Of course, every choice is solely up to your own discretion and Dr. Foreman will respect whatever that decision is.  Overall I was happy. At times he seemed cold and clinical but I can appreciate now how being a Doctor Who is more emotional about it would've made it harder for me.  I think you did a good job at explaining what we were dealing with.  When it came time to decide whether not to do a fourth cycle he laid out the odds for us in a very matter-of-fact factor and again I appreciate that he was not emotional about it and try to use percentages and averages to explain what the possibilities were of things working Dr. Forman is one of the best doctors my husband and I have ever come across. He was our hope at a very dark time in our lives. After our first appointment, we had a clear plan of what to expect. Dr. Forman was very upfront and honest throughout the entire process. We felt as though he was truly invested in seeing us come out on the other side as parents. Even after discharge, he helped us navigate some issues we were having with the pregnancy (not IVF related). He recommended doctors and personally kept in touch with us. We could not have asked for a better experience. His knowledge far surpasses other fertility specialists we have seen and we will be forever grateful for finding him and RMA.Dr. Eric Foreman is very attentive, kind, caring. He is a brilliant doctor. I feel so lucky that I got him as my doctor.  He would respond to questions usually same day. He treats his patients like family or a close friend. Dr Treiser was more than satisfactory as my RE during my time with IVF NJ. I really can't complain about the care I received then. Each time a cycle failed, she had a plan going forward. She was flexible and allowed me to participate in planning the next steps.She can come across as a bit cool at times but like I mentioned previously, I didn't need hand holding, I needed results.

Dr Forman is very caring. He explained every aspect of the IVF process. He was always available to answer questions. I have recommended Dr Forman to many colleagues and would use him again!

As someone who had worked in the medical field for more than 20 years, I appreciated Dr Forman for his medical prowess, his warm demeanor and his honesty. In my opinion, fertility doctor's need to have a good bedside manner, as well as, be innovators in their field. Dr Forman has all of these. Dr. Doherty has incredible ""bedside manner"" and is able to communicate down to the individual detail but with a very compassionate tone. He and his assistants were always very responsive to all our phone and email questions, getting back to us often within an hour or two if during business hours or immediately the next morning if it was a non-urgent request in the evening. We had to undergo several procedures and each time Dr. Doherty described the procedures in detail as well as the impact to our timeline. Since Dr. Doherty is part of a larger practice (RMA), we did not see him every time at the Hamilton office. Instead we saw other doctors part of the practice for bloodwork and ultrasounds. However, we were OK with that because we didn't have any issues with any of the other doctors. In addition, if Dr. Doherty felt that it was important to meet us in person for a particular discussion, he would request that and we would see him directly. Dr. Doherty was orders of magnitude better than our first doctor we saw at a different practice.We feel extremely blessed to have become pregnant on our first try and we will be forever grateful to you and the entire staff at RMANJ. Every interaction we had with doctors, nurses and staff was positive and we knew we were in good hands for every procedure, ultrasound and test result. Given the size of RMANJ, the personal attention we received was unheard of and much appreciated. We always felt informed and aware of what the next steps were and if we didn't, we had no problem finding out whether from you or our nurses. We came to you during an extremely difficult time in our personal lives and we are so appreciative of the compassion we were shown throughout the entire process.As a patient, I wouldn't hesitate for an instant to recommend him to anyone seeking infertility care.  He is extremely compassionate and dedicated to his work.Dr. Forman is a young, knowledgeable and passionate physician.  Your goal of parenthood will instantly become his.  He does not sugarcoat issues or gloss over topics.  If you have 400 questions, he will answer all of them.  He is direct and matter of fact. Not everyone will appreciate his demeanor but I did.Dr. Forman was unlike any doctor I have ever seen in that he was extremely accessible and responsive. One thing that really stood out to me was when we had requested an update about our Day 3 embryos (we were waiting to have CCS done on Day 6 and wanted an update to see how many were still alive), the nurse who was supposed to call us was out that day unexpectedly, and so Dr. Forman emailed me personally that evening to give me an update on the embryos. That spoke volumes to me, and we were so very grateful considering we had just come out of an unsuccessful IVF cycle from a different clinic and our anxieties were extremely high. That showed me that he truly cared about our wellbeing and emotional state.

In addition to answering the millions of questions we had every step of the way with such patience, Dr. Forman also provided information and options in detail so that we truly understood what to expect and what comes next. He was always realistic, but also optimistic, which helped a lot.

I felt I was in great hands with Dr. Forman. He performed my egg retrieval at RMA and 2nd transfer, and I truly trusted his judgement, skill, and care. He is unforgettable and unbeatable.I was extremely happy with my experience at RMA having Dr. Forman as my doctor. He is a very intelligent man who put's his patients best interest first. He advices patients on the best protocol to use, while at the same time taking into consideration if they have ideas. His quick responses to email questions made this process so great knowing that if I ever needed to reach him he was always available. Because of Dr. Forman, my dreams of becoming pregnant came true and we still have 8 more tested embryos stored for the future. I could not of asked for a better experience. Dr. Molinaro on was an excellent doctor.  He always made sure I knew what was going on with my body and treatments and was very open about everything.  He answered e-mails within the same day, called me a couple times to check me after a slight complication, and even e-mailed me on a Sunday morning about an hour or so before my  FET to wish us good luck.  I always felt very comfortable with him as my doctor.  I am currently pregnant with our first child and already look forward to seeing Dr. Molinaro again in the future for our next children.I really couldn't have asked for a better doctor than Dr. Forman. He was the first doctor to provide me with a solution to the issues I was facing when I first became a patient of his. He was extremely dedicated to my health and well being before even starting an IVF cycle. 

Once I did begin the IVF cycle Dr. Forman was always available to answer my questions and would provide a response to any E-mails within minutes (even during the start of his holiday once!) Dr. Forman has an incredible amount of knowledge, and is very skilled in explaining details of treatment options and the IVF process. As my doctor, he never made me feel like a number. He always greeted my husband and I with a smile, and showed a tremendous amount of compassion towards us and our desire to have a family. He has a warm bedside manner and understands that infertility is an emotional process. I always felt that he kept my best interest in mind, while creating his plans for treatment. When canceling a fresh transfer due to mild OHSS, Dr. Forman took the time to explain exactly why it was the best choice to have a frozen transfer instead. I always felt comfortable with our decisions, and felt that each step of the process was truly a team effort. Dr. Forman was extremely informative and went over all possible treatment options. He made the process as easy as possible and followed up with us frequently.  I was comforted in knowing that he is extremely knowledgeable in what he does and I put all my trust in him to help me. I couldn't be happier with my experience. I am currently 15 weeks pregnant. Dr.Forman provided us with results every time.  I've been to other clinics in NY, NJ and across the world and there is no comparison.  Dr. Forman always greeted us with a smile and always laid out the facts and clearly communicated the details. He always presented us with options and allowed us to choose.  I'm extremely lucky to have worked with Dr. Forman.  I recommend him to everyone I meet.  He was very attentive to our needs through out the process. Dr. Forman made us feel like we were important to him and he cared about our success.  He didn't make use feel like a text book case but rather catered to our specific needs.  As per sharef before, I thin the most valuable attribute Dr Forma. Has is his ability to analyze the set backs we had and be able to recommend the best treatment based on science. I really loved this approach as my husband and I like data based decisions and Dr Forman was always very transparent about the options he put in front of us. For example, today I'm pregnant because he recommended this study from a clinic in Spain where they seem to have really solved the endometrian factor..to me it definitely makes sense that not every woman is the same and he recommended a test to determine how receptive and when my uterine linen would be more likely to have an embryo implanted..he recommended this after 2 failed transfers with normal PGD tested embryos, which was very disappointing. Again he recommended and gave us the resources of articles and data to make our decision..I'm really glad ge offered it.
My experience with him was beyond positive! I absolutely trusted his judgement and recommendations as I always felt he was not just trying random, but really taking the time to think about us as individuals and not just a number or statistic, if he had he probably would have told us to just try egg donor, but he knew we didn't want that. 
I have a hard time finding a weaknes in Dr Forman. He really is a very special Doctor and not only because my positive experience with him but also because I know all the other RMA based nurses and personel that I ineracted with RMA would always had a nice thing to say about him. He is just a caring person.Dr. Forman was a great doctor. My husband and I felt very comfortable with him, and trusted his advice along the way. Dr. Forman was very good in covering all the positive outcomes of each step, as well as preparing us for all the negative outcomes that could also happen. We appreciated his honest, professional advice and preparation.
If I ever had a question for Dr. Forman, he would always respond quickly and with all the information I would need. Especially when I was nervous to start my injectable medication, and nervous I was going to do it wrong, Dr. Forman was quick to respond to my email and answer every question I had. 
Dr. Forman was compassionate throughout every step we had to take, and would follow up with every procedure. The roughest call that my husband and I had was when Dr. Forman called to tell us that only one of our eggs made it to the embryo stage (obviously, we were hopeful for more embryos to freeze for future use). But he was very compassionate and sympathetic on the phone, and fully described our next plan of action. 
In the end, the one egg was all we needed, and I am 15 weeks pregnant today! We will absolutely use Dr. Forman again for our future needs!Dr Forman made the difference for us between continuing our fertility journey or giving up. We went to a differ clinic for 5 procedures with no luck, and reached out to Dr Forman for a second opinion- BEST decision we ever made! Not only does he have the exceptional knowledge and skill this job requires (leaps and bounds above our last clinic), but he has the compassion and humility to make each experience a positive one! I cannot speak highly enough of this doctor! And we were nervous, to say the least, at first because of our 5 failed attempts. But I know after one consult with Dr Forman, we had to move to him. And it paid off ten fold! Best fertility doctor! Dr Drews is the most knowledgable infertility specialist in the game. If you want to have a baby, he's your guy! As one of the founders of RMA, he leads the pack! He always made us feel safe, like we were making the right decision and he never pushed us. He stepped up when I was released from RMA back to my doctors care and then had a miscarriage and my doctor wouldn't help me... Dr. Drews did without any hesitation. His bedside manner is amazing, and ultimately he did exactly what he said he would, he got us pregnant and we now have the most beautiful little 3 month old boy. We can't thank Dr. Drews enough. There are no words to say that adequately explain how genuinely thankful we are for him giving us the family we have always dreamed about. It was not an easy road for us. For some it will be but for others it may not. My advice is to stick with it. Stick with Dr. Drews or at the very least, with RMA! They will get you pregnant! It took us four years of trying and three with Dr. Drews but now that our son is here it feels like that Time is a distant memory. We look forward to going back next year and having Dr. Drews help us to add to our family!He was patient and kind and explained everything thoroughly.My experience with Dr. Molinaro was nothing short of life changing. He not only gave me the children I have dreamed of but gave me a new trust in doctors that I never had before. In the past I have never really felt I had a say in my treatments. Dr. Molinaro listened to my thoughts and considered my point of view in all aspects of my care and he was very kind when he didn’t feel my thoughts were in my best interest, but also very supportive when he thought they were and willing to implement them into my treatment when appropriate. He was very good at making me feel like I was his only patient when I was in his care. Dr. Molinaro celebrated my successes and was very human in his responses to my failures. I absolutely valued and appreciated the personal phone calls with embryo reports and pregnancy test results. Many other doctors leave those calls for their nurses to make. I always felt my treatment suggestions were ones that would get me my end goal of a baby in the quickest and least expensive way possible. As a self paying patient with limited financial means, money was a huge factor and risk. Dr. Molinaro was very conscious of this in my treatment recommendations as well. Overall, I can’t say enough good things about him. If you’re on the fence between choosing Dr. Molinaro and another doctor, choose him. I went to him on a recommendation and personally know 5 other women successfully treated by him as well. Dr Eli Ryback is was very informative in detail, and was patient with explaining certain details to me.  He welcomed questions and concerns.  He sympathized when things didn't go as planned, he was joyous when there was good news.  Dr Ryback was very positive and optimistic.HE WAS ""WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET"".
PERSONABLE, STRAIGHT FORWARD, NO NONSENSE. 
SWEET, BUT VERY PROFESSIONAL.
QUICK AND TO THE POINT.
THE ONLY THING THAT SURPRISED ME WAS WHEN I LEFT THE OFFICE, I WAS NEVER CONTACTED BY ANYONE TO ASK WHY...(THE REASON BEING I WAS MOVING)Jamie Morris was very knowledgeable.  From the first day that I had my consultation with her, I felt like I was in good hands.  She always had a plan.  I never felt like I was a lost cause.  She always explained everything to me and would explain over-and-over again if needed.  I wasn't able to produce as many eggs as expected but he remained positive throughout the experience.   He encouraged me to follow our plan and in the end it worked.  His positive encouragement and support was comforting and put me at ease.Dr. Forman is extremely knowledgeable and hard working.  He's one of the few doctors at RMA that keeps an updated professional facebook page. I love seeing his numerous accomplishments and success stories and his pride in his work. It's also fun to see a more personal side of him and his dedication to his work.  He's constantly striving to do better. When our first transfer failed, due to a catheter issue with my anatomy and another doctor, he insisted on doing my second transfer himself.  That pregnancy took!  Unfortunately, the embryo split on its own to identical twins and we lost them at 8 weeks likely due to twin/twin transfusion (entirely unrelated to the transfer process).  Dr. Forman had an amazing bedside manner with our loss, and gave us time to grieve and mourn, but then came back with a plan for a third transfer to ensure success.  It worked!  I'm currently 15 weeks pregnant with a miracle from Dr. Forman, and look forward to returning to him some siblings in the future!He is absolutely brilliant, but I think at this point he would rather her focus on research and making strides in the field rather than working with individual patients. He was at some points dismissive of my concerns, which led him to overlook something major. In the end, I was right, and it cost us a failed FET with some very expensive embryos.Dr. Forman is a perfect combination of a very caring physician and one who is very knowledgeable and able to convey that knowledge in language which we didn't need a medical background to understand.  Dr Forman was the antithesis of our previous physician (who was never available and judgmental) , we were so happy to work with someone as caring and available as him after our last experience. We have nothing but praise for Dr Forman and would highly recommend him to others.Dr. Forman is an unassuming man who is soft spoken, patient, kind, and extremely knowledgeable.  As a patient, I felt respected and safe under his care.  He explained medical procedures slowly and took my concerns seriously.  He always returned my calls/emails promptly and made me feel like a priority patient.  When we first met with Dr. Forman, I could tell he was very knowledgeable in a variety of fertility treatments and he laid out potential options for us. Once we finally got going on cycles, he made himself available for questions and concerns along the way. The biggest thing I appreciate about him is his response time. If I emailed him at night or on the weekends, he usually responded within 15 minutes, which was unexpected but very appreciated. After getting to know him, I felt like I was in great hands and that he had our best interests at heart.Dr. Forman is truly and amazing, caring, excellent doctor. In our first meeting, Dr. Forman was well versed in our fertility treatment to date  which was quite complex and included to other clinics. He was calm and direct, giving us his insight and opinion when asked. We saw Dr. Forman about three times but we were in touch regularly by email and phone. I have never experienced such prompt returns of emails from any doctor. We had follow up phone appointments when needed and Dr. Forman called during the cycle to give me updates on how things were progressing. I truly felt he was invested in us and our quest to have a child. It is a stressful time and he made it so much better. I was sad to leave him and RMANJ when we were told that all looked good at 10 weeks when we moved to an ob/gyn. We are still in touch as I have made it a priority to give him updates on how our pregnancy is progressing. I also know I can go to him with any questions or concerns I might have.Pro: she has background as a therapist, so she's very compassionate. 

Con: we rarely see her - and when we do, visits feel a bit rushed. Also when they make observations during ultrasound, they speak to the nurse/technician using jargon, and not as much to me. Then they say, ""come back in two days for bloodwork"" without much explanation.The doctor was great. Her office has a great eLearning tool that really helps with the education part of the process. Only issue for us is that we started the introduction in April/May but didn't go forward until November because of financial constraints. When we started back up in October the doctor kept referring to our April/May conversation like it was supposed to be fresh in our minds. As a result it was a rocky start for us and it was frustrating until we found our cadence with the process.In our first meeting with Dr. Jurema we felt confident and comfortable with an IUI approach after learning that we had unexplained infertility. Dr. Jurema was smart, polite and attentive during that meeting. At that time the facility was IVF NJ and at the beginning of our cycle I had one appointment at Dr. Jurema's office where I saw him and discussed day-to-day actions. After that, the facility merged with RMA. From that time on we were not able to speak to Dr. Jurema, nor were our appointments with him. We were given the doctor of the moment or the nursing staff for the rest of cycle 1 and cycle 2. During cycle 2, we requested that Dr. Jurema call us after we were given incorrect information by his colleague. When we did receive his call he was cold and short, providing very little understanding. We asked for more personalized care, which he was not able to provide. We emailed Dr. Jurema when we left the facility explaining that we were unable to continue due to the lack of attentiveness and personalization. Unfortunately it appears that Dr. Jurema is handcuffed by RMA, but we can't say for sure as we were only with him a short time before the facility transitioned.Our fertility treatments began 6 years ago and including my OBGYN who facilitated two Clomid cycles we saw 3 doctors prior to going to RMA.  We saw Dr. Foreman a couples of years prior to actually starting fertility treatments.  When we were ready to start we went directly to Dr. Foreman.  I was embarrassed to be back a second time but he never made us feel uncomfortable.  He did not waste our time and make us redo every test that we already had done. We picked up where we left off.   He reviewed the old tests and explained everything to us again and our options.   He was honest and we trust him.   
My egg retrieval was done by another doctor and I had internal bleeding after.  We knew this was a possible risk from the retrieval. I went to my local hospital ER and the on call OBGYN admitted me and told me that I need to have emergency surgery and that I may lose my ovaries.  My husband called our nurse right away and Dr. Foreman who was in with a patient actually stepped out and got on the phone with the on call OBGYN and told him to wait on surgery and to transfer me to Morristown.  Needless to say they never transferred me but just monitored me for 24 hours and the bleeding stopped and no surgery was needed.   I do not know what would hve happened if Dr. Foreman did not get on the phone with the ER that morning. 
After struggling to get pregnant for 6 years we wanted to implant two embryos but Dr. Foreman explained his standpoint and educated us the benefits of implanting one.   We agreed with his professional opinion.  Dr. Foreman was not on the day of our implantation but he came down to do it.   When we went in for our last visit I needed a recommendation for a new OBGYN and Dr. Foreman provided us with a few names to chose from.   
We now have a beautiful 3 month old and still keep in touch with Dr. Foreman.   We have our other embryos frozen with RMA and there is no question that we would be returning to Dr. Foreman when we are ready for our next miracle.    From the day we met Dr. Doherty during our initial consultation in February 2014, we knew our dreams of starting of family would come true. His confidence and compassion were evident. He always had a plan for us and always did what was in our best interest. He always listened to our fears and calmed them. He always answered our questions.  He celebrated with us during the good times  and consoled us during the bad times. When our daughter was born in June 2016, we couldn't wait to share the news with him and then introduce our daughter to him. He will always have a special place in our hearts.  When we were finally released from his care to continue our OB , we were sad to leave such an amazing physician and wished he could  have care for us for our entire pregnancy. Dr. Forman is a dedicated doctor to his patients and his field.  My husband and I were both very interested in the fact that Dr. Forman was and is involved in research!  This was important to us.  During our consultation Dr. Forman answered all of our questions and concerns about my age.   Dr. Forman was always calm, explained things clearly and both my husband and I understood the process and all the different steps - it's very involved.   I was 100% comfortable and confident with Dr. Forman - so much that after we discussed the treatment plan - I NEVER second guessed anything .   I just went with it.  He is a wonderful doctor.I always said he was brutally honest yet confident.  We had 3 out of 4 successful transfers with Dr. M.  Our one failure he didn't seem too enthusiastic about when we decided to put in our only female embryo left.  But he did it and said it was ok.  It was negative.  We sat and had a chat afterward and he said ""it wouldn't have been my choice to transfer that one first.  But I'm confident you will get your third child in the embryos you have left.""  After out transfer immediately in the next cycle, he said ""and we will have great news in 8 days"".  I told my nurse that he can't get my hopes up like that.  Her response was that he was very confident in this embryo.  And so we had our third child.  First I went through 2 hormone injection stimulation cycles at Columbia Reproductive Women's Center at 1790 Broadway in NYC. In both cases at Columbia they told me that they would stop the treatment after the first ultrasound exam. I believe, as a result of the ultrasound, they did not see enough follicles being formed, although they did not tell me how many follicles they saw and why they decided they would discontinue the IVF process.

While treated by Dr. Forman at RMA New Jersey, I went through 3 hormone injection stimulations. In all of these 3 injection stimulations, the ultrasounds showed a low number of follicles - anywhere from 2 to 4 follicles per stimulation. Yet, Dr. Forman did not discontinue my treatment. He said there is hope. So we proceeded to the egg retrieval in all 3 stimulation cycles. I believe the first time they retrieved 3 eggs, the second retrieval resulted in 2 eggs, and the 3rd retrieval resulted in 1 egg. The 1st retrieval resulted in 1 fertilized egg, the 2nd retrieval resulted in 1 fertilized egg and the 3rd retrieval did not result in any fertilized egg. In summary, as a result of 3 injection stimulations, they saw about 5-6 follicles in total, and as a result of 3 egg retrievals, they retrieved 5 eggs, of which 2 got fertilized and were healthy (they did PGD/PGS testing on all retrieved eggs). They transferred the 1st good egg and I got pregnancy but after 6 weeks or so the embryo stopped developing and I miscarried. However, my second and last healthy egg resulted in a healthy full term baby. Because of my low production of follicles, the Columbia doctors disregarded me completely in the very beginning of the process and they did not want to bother with egg retrievals, while Dr. Forman and his team gave me a chance. Dr. Forman did a miracle - from potential 5-6 follicles, as a result of 3 separate injection stimulations, we got 2 frozen healthy fertilized eggs that resulted in 1 healthy baby. What Dr. Forman did was against any IVF statistics and I am so thankful to him for taking the chance with me and supporting me in every step of this long process. Also, I would like to add that I live in Brooklyn and work in NYC, while Dr. Forman and RMA NJ are located in New Jersey. However, that was not much inconvenience as the blood monitoring and the initial ultrasound exams I did at RMA Brooklyn in the morning and Dr. Forman would get the results and review them in the afternoon. All the 3 egg retrievals and 2 egg transfers I did at RMA New Jersey facilities. I feel incredibly grateful and lucky to end up in the competent and caring care of Dr. Forman. He was recommended by a friend of mine who works in the genetics field and she expressed the opinion that Dr. Forman is one of the best upcoming IVF doctors in the tri-state area and that RMA NJ have the best IVF labs (labs play a key role in the IVF treatment and they should be taken in consideration when selecting your doctor).
He is understanding and has a gentle bedside manner.  We trusted him completely - his accomplishments are extremely impressive if you research him -and he explained everything so we could understand it - in layman's terms.  He made us feel comfortable every step of the way and adjusted the course of treatment as he deemed necessary.  He was willing to try different treatments in order to give us the best chance of conceiving.  Dr. Forman is intelligent, caring, compassionate, available, and trustworthy. He is kind and empathetic. He is never condescending and always makes sure we are all on the same page and that we understand what's happening. I have and will refer friends to Dr. Forman. Dr. Forman is a wonderful man. He understands the journey we went through and was there for every step of the way. He held our hands, walked us through and explained everything. When we hit a bump, he felt it along with us. He wants us to achieve our dream of having a healthy baby as much as we did. I only wanted him to do the retrieval and implantation and he did. That alone made me more comfortable because he knew our situation and felt he was just as determined as we were. (Not criticizing any other Doctor there at all or say they did not want the same thing.p because they are all amazing...But it was just very comforting to have our actual Doctor do these procedures.)  He never made us feel like a number or that he did not remember us, even with the number of patients he sees on a daily basis. He knew all our information and backroad etc every time we saw him. He never rushed us through appointments or phone calls or emails. He made the whole process as pleasant as it could be. Dr. Forman is extremely smart.   He explains everything very thorough.   Since he is so smart and so dedicated to his work,  it may look like he doesn't care about you because he is not a very emotional person.  But by his actions and commitment to his patients you can tell he really cares about you and helping you get pregnant.   When he knew I was in the office or getting a procedure done, and he wasn't the doctor on call that day but he was in the office,  he would stop into my appointment.   He even did one of my retrievals when he wasn't on call to do that because he cared so much.   When I had a miscarriage after 6 weeks of pregnancy I needed a D and C.  I could get an appointment for a week after there was no heartbeat.   I was so upset,  I just wanted it done ASAP.  Dr. Forman called me to talk about my lost and I told him that my appointment want for over a week.   He said he would have done the D and C for me right away if he wasn't leaving for a conference.   That made me feel so great and so thankful that my doctor cared so much about me.   I would recommend Dr. Forman to anyone who is going though infertility treatments.  Dr Forman is the best and he helped us achieve a sucessful pregnancy. He explained things as we went along with the process and answered all of our questions. We always felt reassured with him in our corner. Words cannot express our gratitude for all Dr. Forman has done for us. We feel blessed that our path led us into Dr. Forman's hands. His dedication, knowledge, and passion for reproductive medicine was evident to us upon meeting him in November 2014. We immediately felt comfortable with the journey ahead and confident that our dreams of becoming parents could actually happen. He has such a calming way and quickly realized how best to approach us. He was always been generous with his time and thoroughly answered all our questions (and I had many!).  It is the little things he did that have truly impressed us: calling on a Saturday afternoon to check in because we hadn't seen you in the monitoring process, taking as much time as needed to answer any worries about going through the trigger and retrieval process for the first time, adjusting his schedule to come do the retrievals, holding my hand during a moment of panic when My husband couldn't be there, and finally stopping to talk to my husband on his way upstairs to give a report. Those are just a few things Dr. Forman did while we were under his care at RMA. We now have a healthy and beautiful 6 month old baby boy. We still email Dr. Forman about how our son is growing and he always responds promptly and seems to truly be interested. We look forward to another transfer with Dr. Forman later this year or early next year. Dr. Foreman is an awkward communicator, evasive and never grasped the accountability and commitment of the process.  We couldn't get a clear path forward or a plan - in many cycles.  I wouldn't recommend him to an enemy if I had one.At our first appointment when Dr. Hong reviewed our detailed records of intercourse and cycle tracking and told us that she was surprised we weren't pregnant yet, I felt a huge weight lifted.  Knowing that what we were doing should have led to a pregnancy made me feel ready to try interventions.  She explained what the procedure was for our testing cycle and where we would proceed for our first medicated cycle.  She gave us the estimate that we would most likely not need IVF and while it turned out that 4 cycles of IUI didn't lead to pregnancy, we were happy because she didn't make us keep trying something that didn't work.  She was ready for us to move onto IVF at that point.
Dr. Hong took time on days she got to the clinic early to personally perform my morning monitoring (even when she wasn't the on call doctor that day).  On those days she was making a special effort to perform my ultrasound and see how my follicles were developing.  Her personal interest in our case was really touching.  While she always made the decision for does of medication and the timing of our trigger/IUI based on the ultrasound pictures and notes from the doctor performing my monitoring.....the days she personally looked always felt more thorough.  I got the feeling that Dr. Hong was genuinely rooting for us!Dr. Kim is a professional and experienced.  We liked to call him the ""embryo whisperer"", as we always had positive results when he did our transfers.  As his patient, he came down to personally do my transfers.  I appreciated that.She was very caring and compassionate. She was positive and made me feel like this could really happen for us. At our first meeting she was really good at learning more about us and connecting with us on a personal level. Dr. Hong was thorough and explained the whole process, risks, and possible outcomes.  She made me feel comfortable every step of the way.  She was very caring and showed compassion.  I remember how stressed I was during my first appointment that I burst into tears and Dr. Hong put me at ease and reassured me that there is always hope.  Dr. Morris was very caring and sweet. I was disappointed that she did not perform my egg retrieval or my transfer. The only procedure that Dr. Morris performed was my saline sonogram. She was always friendly and talkative during morning monitoring and made sure I was aware of everything. Dr. Drews is an amazing physician that helped me become a mom. He was compassionate during difficult times, yet always remained realistic and positive. He always took time to discuss everything with my husband and I, so we fully understood protocols and procedures. Dr. Drews answered any questions we had and was always available. His knowledge and expertise is easily observable and truly cares for each patient.I trusted Dr. Forman. Trusted his knowledge and ability, trusted his recommendations and treatment plans and as a result had confidence in the process. Infertility intermixed with a desire to have a family takes an emotional toll on would be parents and requires more patience than I had imagined. Each test/step of the process seemed to uncover something new from low morphology to PCOS to Endometritis to Trisomy that would require patience to work through and add another layer of worry/doubt. Dr Forman thoughtfully provided the answers/advice/recommendations I needed to work through the issues and generally feel better about the process. It is very easy to get wrapped up in the issues/science uncovered and worry. Dr. Forman kept things simple by explaining things to us at a high level. When I wanted to know the details and specifics of ""how the watch is made"" he clearly explained them and when I ""just wanted the watch"" he kept it simple for me. At the end of the day, results are what you want instead of hand holding and we have a healthy baby due to Dr. Forman of which I am grateful.As previous stated before Dr. Kim is an amazing man and someone who also dealt with infertility so he knows what it does to you and how it changes you. He helped find me clinical studies to help save me money since my insurance didn’t cover IVF. Dr. Treiser is a great physician. She is extremely knowledgeable. At first she may seem a bit cold, but she really isn't. She is kind and compassionate and cares deeply about her patients. You can tell that she has a passion for her job and loves what she does. She is very candid and honest.Dr. Gulati was up front about what she expected out of treatment. She also reviewed my charts and was armed with knowledge about what we were going through. She didn't ask many questions just reaffirmed what she read and then allowed us to ask her questions. I felt like I had know her forever.I very much value you the experience that I had while under Dr. Forman's care and I have and will continue to refer anyone facing fertility issues to Dr. Forman. His style is fairly delicate and mild-mannered, yet he is very straight-forward and made very complex discussions easy to understand. I really cannot say enough good things about him. As I mentioned earlier, he went out of his way to personally ensure that I was given the best care possible. He came in on a holiday when he wasn't even on call to do my embryo transfer, which meant the world to my husband and me. He is an absolute asset to RMA, and beyond his patient care I know he's on the leading edge of research (I believe that the research that he's led personally impacted me). He really is a perfectionist and the care that he gives reflects that.  Needless to say the results speak for themselves, I had one egg retrieval, and my first embryo transfer was a success and resulted in my beautiful daughter Elizabeth. I still had 11 healthy embryos available to be transferred after that. I will forever feel indebted to Dr. Forman for the give that he gave my family.Dr. Ryback made a difficult process bearable.  My diagnosis was DOR and I didn't respond well to the meds.  But he held out hope and kept adjusting my meds in the hopes of getting better response.  He always made time for me and arranged for conference calls to discuss failed cycles and his thoughts moving forward.  His bedside manner was gentle and very caring.  He is honest, yet open to patient suggestions. Most importantly he gets the job done. He is a very intelligent doctor. I felt like I was in good hands with Dr.Kim. I have heard some say he is not the hand holding type. However, what I needed was someone who would be blunt and get us pregnant. We owe him the world! We have our absolute blessing as a result of his skills and talent in the field. Dr. Morris talks to you as if she is not speaking with a patient but a business person. I did not feel comfortable and her time is precious. We are timed! Each time you see or speak with her either on the phone or face to face it is $300 for 15 minutes. It is all about the money! She was never there 100% of the time. Whenever I do my sonogram, it is always different doctors. Dr. Morris was not the one who did my retrievals. But I do love that doctor cause she is more sympathetic. I would not recommend her.Richard Scott is incredibly intelligent, and cares very deeply for the work that he does. He understands that he is working with human beings, and that each case is unique. He was always willing to answer any questions that we had.I cannot rave enough about her. I still refer people to her and as I counsel people on infertility I call her to ask her advise and to explain things to me. She has become a friend, and was always my partner. I would research and ask her about my findings and she never had an ego and was always willing to listen and appreciative that I wanted to be my own advocate.The doctor was friendly and approchable. She made me feel relax to talk to her.
She understood my challenge and was blunt and open and honest with me. 
I appreciate her being sensitive to my challenges at the same time she gave me reality of thingsSometimes it was difficult to be in touch with my provider and I didn’t always feel like there was someone giving me feedback during my monitoring.  When I was able to speak with her she was wonderful and did a great job at putting me at ease while also making sure I had completely realistic expectations. He was fine I guess. We only saw him once but spoke on the phone a couple of times. He pursued more testing to try to figure out our unexplained infertility but without any luck. Not sure if some of the add-ons to the IVF procedure were necessary, but I'm not sure that they weren't. Though he’s present my ultrasounds have all been done by a trainee with his guidance. He always seems positive about my chances of pregnancy but when I ask questions often refers to getting that information from the nurses. A majority of my information has come from the nurses. Dr. Rybak explains everything on a good way, always has a strong point to prove his knowledge! He always has an answer for everything, would not leave the patient alone instead he would help the patient to make a decision. 
He shared his frustration when I could not develop any blastocyst, but he was enthusiastic to change the protocol and try to avoid this problem. He always gives me so much hope regarding my age. Dr. Kaser is empathetic, smart, and driven to succeed. He lets his heart lead rather than the numbers. This really matters -- having someone in your corner. He's personable and answers all your questions without hesitation or annoyance. He's an amazing doctor. Don't let his compassion make you think he isn't exceptional with the numbers -- he's gifted on all levels.  Dr Shastri is kind, compassionate and smart. She was my doctor for the past 5 years, and she helped me create the family I have today. Although I was an extremely complicated case, Dr Shastri never gave up on me. Instead she would brainstorm to try all possibilities. She always made sure I was receiving the best care. Dr. Werner is very compassionate while also being direct and understanding. I felt for the first time a doctor listened to what I needed, this was my 3rd doctor. I would 100% recommend her. I had a hysteroscopy with her and she was very detailed before and after the procedure in giving me details. I am going to be starting a IVF round with her soon. Dr Costantini has some of the best bedside manner that i have ever seen in a physician. She never made me feel that she didn’t have my best interests in mind. She brought peace and positivity at an otherwise trying time. What impressed me the most about Dr. Rybak was his humility. Back in 2012 when I first saw him, an interesting medical situation presented itself. Dr. Rybak said he'd review the situation with his colleagues to determine a best course of action. I was so impressed by the fact that he readily admitted that he needed to consult with others and didn't need to put up a bravado that he was all knowing. He got me to a successful pregnancy, even with my complicated medical background. He did this with kindness and compassion and always with a smile. He's always willing to entertain my crazy questions and ideas and I trust that he will only recommend and proceed with what will work best for me. I highly recommend Dr. Rybak!Dr. Ryback is very compassionate and has made me feel very comfortable. I struggle with anxiety associated with procedures and he has helped me by providing medication and being supportive during procedures. She was very supportive along the whole process. Making sure I was ready and all my questions was answered.  Also her performing my transfer procedure was extra special because she had been part of the journey and she was there for the completion. Dr. Molinaro was wonderful. He was warm and easy to talk to. I felt very comfortable with each step of our process and felt fully informed. Dr. Molinaro called with some results to ensure I understood and was fast to respond to all emails. She is knowledgeable but very absent in the process. She did not perform my retrieval, polyp removal or any other appt but was there for the transfer. Just more interaction with Dr Treiser and occasional phone call would have fostered a better connection. He was super genuine and explained everything well.  I would have liked to see him more frequently but that ended up happening when my case became more complex.  He was good about returning phone calls and never rushed through the conversations. He was good one on one and made me feel like I was in good hands whenever I saw him. The clinic makes it hard to get in touch with him on the phone which was very frustrating but once he was made aware of the situation he took care of me. Dr. Kaser met with us for almost two full hours on our first visit. He is monitoring our current IVF cycle from NJ (we live in PA). He has called on several occasions to check-in, see if we have any questions and touch-base about any upcoming changes. I can't express enough how professional and thorough he has been with us. Dr. Jurema is without a doubt a skilled practitioner.  However, based on my experience, I do think he tends to overpromise without sharing possible realities. I was told that based on the quality of my embryos, chance of implation was 80% which seemed like a done deal in my mind. However but transfers resulted in loss and heartache. I know that at a certain point, he has no control over the outcome but I wish I had been better prepared for failure. Extremely caring, very knowledgeable, helped us reach our dream of having a baby. Explained things well, was available when needed, very professional. As a patient of IVF, treatment can be tiring and scary. I felt comfortable in Dr. Franasiaks care. I felt like I was being helped on a daily basis. Dr Rybak is such a thorough and kind doctor.  I went with him based on recommendations from several friends, we are glad we did.  He communicates with my husband and I and takes time to speak with us over the phone, together and separately. He has helped my husband work through his concerns and adjusted our treatment as needed.  His professionalism is very high, my husband is in pharmaceutical research so he can also communicate with my husband on that level as well.  Dr. Rauch is an amazing doctor.  I was referred to Dr. Rauch by my sister, who also went through the process of IVF. Seeing the success that my sister had, I came to the first appointment with hope that I too would have a baby.  During our first appointment, I left understanding the love and respect  that my sister had for Dr. Rauch.  Her skills, compassion, empathy and knowledge go without saying.  There were several challenges that we faced during the IVF process that prolonged the desired outcome, but Dr. Rauch conveyed the importance of taking these medically necessary steps so that when pregnancy did happen, it would be successful.  Dr. Rauch always made herself available when needed and walked me through each step of the process, continuing to display confidence that I would get pregnant. Dr. Bergh is a godsend. After multiple early miscarriages with other fertility specialists (including a miscarriage of a PGS normal embryo), I had lost all hope. Per Dr. Bergh’s recommendation, I did a gluten/dairy free diet for several months. He had anecdotal experience with other patients where the diet helped with implantation. I ended up getting way more PGS normal embryos than I had with my prior clinic, and my first transfer worked.I live in California and was having a problem finding a doctor to remove a polyp before I could have my transfer. I mentioned this to my nurse and she called me back within an hour to tell me that Dr. Drews said he would do it if I was willing to fly out. 

Dr. Drews was also extremely confident about that we would have success. A lot of doctors will repress providing any sort of opinion on outcome so as to not create expectations but Dr. Drews wasn't afraid to give us hope when we had so little. I truly believe that it contributed to our success. He believed we'd have a baby so we were able to believe too and remain positive.He is one of the founders of RMANJ. He treated myself and my wife with respect and compassion. He thoroughly explained fertility, treatment options, necessary testing, and how the clinic operates. He was genuinely happy when we had our daughter and genuinely disappointed when my wife had a more difficult time getting  pregnant. She was very helpful in helping me understand all different aspects of treatments. With having gone thru multiple losses she was very caring in trying to find out what the problem was. I never felt like a number with her.  Dr. Forman is soft-spoken and has an extremely calm and non-anxious presence. Sometimes he came across a bit detached, but I never felt uncared for. He did my egg retrieval and helped calm me when I became anxious and teary on the table. He is not super warm and fuzzy but that was fine as I needed him to help me maintain reasonable expectations. He is a great doctor. He really listens and explains everything- I know so much more about my body now. He explains why he does things, why he wouldn't do something else, and answers every question I have along the way. Dr. Rybak is excellent at answering all questions and explaining things in a clear and understanding way.  He also shows true concern for each of his patients.  He is absolutely brilliant and not afraid to try new things if something isn't working.  He makes you leave his office feeling so cared about and calm.Dr. Constantini is caring and compassionate with me. She is very knowledgeable and straightforward as well. She showed such immense care with my recent loss and showed such encouragement with my most recent FET . I saw dr scott only once. I scheduled phone calls though and those calls happened on time and as expected. he had plenty of time for talk and always called in a quiet place with availability to chat. I never felt like he rushed me. he talked to me in a respectful manner quoting stats so I could easily understand them. Dr Forman is the most attentive doctor I've ever known. The process is so nerve racking and emotional and Dr Forman made us feel like he was right there with us every step of the way. I could email him with any concerns, questions or worries I was having and he would always get back to me so quickly, sometimes within minutes! He even emailed with me when I was worried about spotting in early pregnancy from his vacation in Hawaii! Dr. Forman is extremely knowledgeable and thorough and I always felt that my treatment was in the best hands. I'm now 17 weeks pregnant with our baby girl and we will always have Dr. Forman to thank. I also referred my best friend to Dr. Forman and she had success with him in the first cycle. We both refer to him as a miracle worker!  
Dr. Forman explained the different treatment options that were available to me and tried to help me narrow down the cause of infertility. Whenever I had questions, he took the time to explain to me in details in person or via email. His strong clinical research background also gives me additional confidence in choosing him as my primary doctor.I have nothing but positive things to say about Dr. M. This is my third RE and the whole experience has been so much better than my other experiences. He gives personalized attention, is a great communicator, and is extremely knowledgeable. We had a great experienced with Dr. Forman..I was impressed with his knowledge and always on top of the latest in medicine advances. He was able to rule out different options of treatment as we tried several times. He never have up and propsed a unique course of action to which we owe being pregnant now. Still a few weeks to go buy hoping for the best.Dr. Forman is the kind of Dr. I need.  He's very detail oriented and not an alarmist.  Becuase fertility is sensitive by nature, there are a lot of uncertainties and Dr. Forman made sure to explain everything in detail as we went through and answered any questions I had as well as helped out a great deal with the needed insurance coverage.Dr. Forman is a fantastic doctor. The fertility process is extremely emotional and physically taxing. I always felt that I was in great hands. If you are looking for a great doctor to lead you through this process, make sure to see Dr. Forman--I would recommend him to any of my closest friends and family. Dr Forman was fine. A little on the dry side but he explained everything well and got the job done in the time frame laid out. So overall the process went wellFrom the moment I met Dr Forman he made me feel very comfortable and understood. He was knowledgeable and non judgmental. Dr Forman is a caring Dr who identifies with not only what you want to accomplish but what you've been through to get there.  He was very informative about what it would take to get our desired results. He genuinely cares for his patients. He called me himself a couple of times to check in about how I was handling the very frequent long drives to get to the offices, when we were impatiently waiting for my pregnancy test result to come in and after I became pregnant.
I never felt like I was being talked down to the way lot of Dr's can make you feel. Dr. Hock was warm and friendly and compassionate. She was very easy to work with. We were very happy under her care. When we experienced a chemical pregnancy she was very delicate with us and helped us deal with the disappointment. She was professional, I just felt like she didn’t care that much if I actually got pregnant. She told me she was “really surprised,” when she heard I got pregnant via ivf. I ended up having a miscarriage and she never reached out after that. He was amazing! Intelligent, compassionate, and caring. He is always looking for new solutions and techniques to help his patients reach the ultimate goal. He will go above and beyond for every one of his patients, including calling us to wish us ""Mazel Tov"" once our baby girl arrived! Honestly, we loved her. We trusted her with our health, future babies, and more. She knew exactly what to do and when. Dr. Treiser was the primary doctor behind my treatment plan, however I did not see her for monitoring appointments.  She did perform my transfer.  As it is a large clinic, many doctors were seen throughout my treatment.  I was assigned a coordinator, who acted as the go between between myself and Dr. Treiser.Dr Morris took time to review my history and explain everything. She was polite and lighthearted but didn't sugar coat things. When things were not successful she immediately moved to plan B and explained again why we changed plans. Dr. Rauch has no faults!! She is there every step of the way! When there were setbacks she called me personally to speak with me and make sure I was ok!!! She is seriously the best!! My husband and I are so happy to have her as our RE on this journey!!!He was amazing. He was so incredibly thorough and I am confident I would not have a baby in my arms right now had he not been so forward thinking and discovered all of my issues. My husband had a chromosome disorder, I had a thyroid issue and was diagnosed with a very rare and VERY difficult to diagnose blood clotting disorder that only shows on blood work while pregnant. He sent me to a hematologist for special testing after we lost a heart beat on a seamingly perfect pregnancy all of a sudden at 8 weeks. Had he not done that we would not know I had the issue. Dr. Jurema has a very kind and gentle demeanor and I trust his recommendations in regards to my treatment protocol. He is also a compassionate person, which is invaluable to a patient going through this process. Dr. Jurema delivers the good and the bad with a warm touch and always makes sure to answer any questions throughout the process. He is very candid and to the point.  He is clearly knowledgeable and experienced.  He was very direct with schedules and what steps were going to involved through the cycle.  Dr. M also brought an objective, fresh perspective to our case and did not push us to hard in any particular direction.  He wanted us to decide what is best for our own situation.Dr Shastri was so compassionate. She personally called me when our results were unfortunate. She spent time with us without rushing us. She also made us feel like we could take all the time in the world asking as many questions we liked. We were unsuccessful but not due to the doctor. I wish I had started with her from the start of our journey. She was awesome. I just felt like she understood what I was always asking and she never made me feel like I was taking too much of her time or asking too many questions. She’s a very technically talented provider with incredible emotional intelligence and bedside manner.She has been very informative and helped me to know what would go on. I wanted to Move quick to get started and she was totally on board to work with what I wanted. She was eager to help. I appreciated her bedside manner. Always positive and comforting through everything I’ve done thus far.  Dr Constantini was warm and supportive during a time that I was hesitant and worried about an outcome from a previous pregnancy. I truly felt that she would give me the best care and support me through out treatment. We are just getting started with Dr. Hong and found her to be warm and kind.  She was very thorough in coverage of the donor egg process, and even drew us a little diagram telling up what to expect.  We are currently waiting to choose a donor.Dr. Rauch is a fantastic doctor who treats each individual rather than just lumping everyone together. She is thorough and does everything she can to get you pregnant. I would highly recommend her as she always takes the time to listen and walk you through the entire processVery nurturing and helped ease my anxiety. She didn’t sugarcoat things and always made sure I was aware of the treatment process. I think she is a wonderful doctor and really went above and beyond to help us figure out why we were having so many setbacks in the process. I feel Dr Rybak is compassionate, honest and professional. He understood my needs and yes I felt he delivered that but I cant say the same regarding the clinic he works for, the communication is the strongest suit.  Dr. Chu is very nice. She explained the risk and all with iuis. I talked more with Lisa, her nurse about procedures and answers all my questions and my concerns. I feel that dr. Chu is very brief unless I asked for explanations. She is very thorough with what I’ll expect and what’s the next step. in the previous i described it pretty well  but again Dr. Eli Rybak was the right Dr. in the right time he has most what i wanted of a Dr. compassionate nice caring explaining knowledgeable & much more   he is a great person & dr.I wish every iui and ultrasound was with Dr. Doherty. I recommend him all the time. He is honest, caring and compassionate. He tells all the facts even if you don't want to hear them which helps me be an informed patient. I really like Dr Hong. I don't hear from her a lot personally but rather hear from her nurse. I have heard from her directly for issues that require more discussion. I find her to be compassionate and positive and willing to walk through things with me so I can understand. Hoping this next IUI will give me my baby!I  am so grateful to Dr. Forman. He was very responsive with all my questions & concerns. I really felt he truly cared about me and my success. He is an outstanding doctor. I trusted him with his care and he made the right decisions for me. I highly recommend him! I trusted Dr Forman and I have a son because of him.  I referred my best friend and business partner to him and now she has a son because of him.  There is no one else I would trust to try to have another child, dr Forman selected the embryo.  After the transfer I went to California on a vacation and he helped me find a quest lab and an emergency walk in clinic if needed that he could provide info to if my progesterone levels did not continue to rise.  I am not sure all physicians give their patients that kind of treatment.She was very nice, sensitive to situation yet honest of options.
Very knowledgeable in explaining procedures and proccesses.We have had a great experience being treated by Dr. Forman. We always felt very calm in his presence, we never felt pressured. We always felt as if we were his only patients being treated in this period of time. Every question or concern was always addressed and answered. Any problem that came up during treatment was always solved in the best way, without us feeling or knowing that there was a problem at all. Dr. Forman us always calm, patient and friendly. It was a pleasure ti be treated by Dr Forman!Dr. Forman was great, he took his time to explain my condition and create a plan just for me. He was monitoring my treatments and communicated with the nurses to provide the best care possible. Dr. Forman diagnosed me with PCOS which caused my infertility, this was easily treated.  It took me 3 IUI's and 1 year to finally get pregnant. I am now 8 weeks and 4 days and my baby is growing healthy and happy. Thank you Dr. Forman for giving us our little miracle. Dr. Forman has been an absolute pleasure to work with. Unlike other doctors we consulted with and worked with, he was absolutely compassionate, informative, supportive, caring, and provided us with individualized treatment specific for our needs. He is an excellent physician and I would recommend him to anymore struggling with infertility! He was an extremely knowledgeable and caring Doctor. It is very evident that he cares deadly for his patients and wants to see their treatment successful.Dr. Constantini was generous with her time and answered a million questions. She got to know me and my situation and helped guide me in making tough decisions. Her medical care is excellent. She found I had a uterine septum that no other doctor had caught after years of fertility treatments! She also has a great bedside manner. She is warm,  thoughtful, straightforward and a great communicator. I cannot say enough good things about RMA. I went to two locations (Eatontown and Basking Ridge), and the staff at both places was exceptional. The facilities were outstanding, and everyone was very compassionate. She is very direct and gives quality information. She came in herself to do my second embryo transfer (after first failed) and we were successful on that second try. She seemed to care about results. Always answered by questions. I did a lot of research about immunosuppressive therapies and while she admitted she didn't necessarily agree with what another doctor told me, she listened and gave her opinion and didn't make me feel crazy.Dr. Treiser responded to emails quickly and completely. She was caring, and wanted to make sure our expectations were met and our anxieties talked about. We were fortunate that that our one transfer was successful.  strengths is knowledge of process and statistics of infertility research. Weaknesses in empathy and explanation of infertility for patients. Pushed for IVF when I wasn't positive how long I could try other options and methods, also risks were not fully explainedDr Fischer takes her time and is thorough. There were some times I did not feel we were talking about the same thing but that was fixed. Everything felt very methodical and I sometimes wished it was more personal along the wayI have nothing but great things to say about Dr. Molinaro. He ALWAYS showed awesome bedside matter and when emailing him with a question, he would always respond within the day. He is very attentive with his patients and I truly felt how much he cared and how much he wanted to us to reach our goal of becoming pregnant. Doctor Shastri is such a great doctor. She has great bed side manner, she is very caring, very compassionate, she makes sure you are comfortable and all together she is wonderful. I would definitely recommend her to everyone.She’s understanding of concerns and has done a lot of research and is honest with her answers. She also took into consideration my suggestions to help get pregnant. Without me pushing for further testing and her listening we may not have found the endometritis before this next iui. I am hopeful for my next cycle thanks to her!Dr. Drews is very experienced and explains the procedures very well which brought a lot of comfort for me having gone through repeated non-successful cycles in my home country. He is trustworthy and uplifting.Dr. Treisser called me a handful of times to personally provide lab results and discuss further plans. She was available when I had unexpected problems. She failed to see if I knew my blood type and had me go to the emergency room for bleeding. Overall my husband and I enjoyed working with Dr. Yih. She was our biggest supporter through everything and worked to make this process as easy to understand as possible. If she was not the dr to perform a procedure she checked in with me personally as soon as the procedure was over. dr. Mavani is very compassionate . She was there to hear my concerns and adjust the treatment plan when necessary . She adjusted her schedule to fit me in for the additional testing that was required after my first FET failed There are not enough words to describe our gratitude and appreciation for Dr. Kaser. He so warm and caring. Emotionally, going through IVf was very difficult for me. He was incredibly supportive, responsive (answers emails and phone calls so quickly), and just overall amazing. He is really the best!She does her research on you before your appointment. She did not keep me waiting in the waiting room. She was compassionate of the intense emotional roller coaster I am going through. Her nursing staff calls regularly to check-in and handled my emergency well. Lastly, she looks at each patient as an individual, not as a number.Very direct and honest person and able to handle tons of questions. Extremely professional and knowledgeable. Ability to built trust and explain procedures, risks and different scenarios. very empathetic.My experience as her patient was positive, aside from the fact that the treatment hasn't worked so far, though I was apprised of this in advance. I have always felt that she cares very much, was involved in the treatment and was trying to get the best results.I have been a patient of Dr. Doherty's for over a year now and cannot say enough great things about him. He explains everything to us in great detail and walked us through every step. Always went above and beyond for us. Dr Doherty is so warm and personable, yet always straight forward. My husband and i became his patient by chance and are ever so thankful. I wish I could give him more than 5 stars. Just amazing.We did a mock transfer and I'm so glad we did. It was difficult so she dilated my cervix. She had me come in with no appointment needed for a second mock to make sure it worked. I truly think this helped ensure the transfer was successful. I was so tense during the mock that she recommended valium for the day of. She made sure she would have no issues for transfer day.

My husband had extremely low sperm count (single digits) so we froze several vials and it was successful. We had a backup plan just in case that was not successful day of.

 Dr. Forman was very accessible via email and was very thoughtful about my medical history, past treatments, and what treatment protocol options are.  He used fewer medications than other clinics and achieved the same level of output.  He was more hands on than doctors at other clinics.  His science and his bedside manner are both top notch.  She listened to our situation and got us started right away. There was no wait time to get moving with treatment. When I had a delay due to a cyst she called me over the weekend to check in. She talked to me for over an hour. He is our biggest cheerleader and at the same time helps us to manage our expectations. Dr Bergh tried incredibly hard to help me carry my own pregnancy despite many miscarriages previously. He held hope for me and was compassionate as well as straightforward when the pregnancy also ended in miscarriage.Doherty is very caring and knowledgeable doctor. He explained everything and let us know what the risks and expectations were realistically. Weaknesses, he wasn't always there for appointments because he goes to different offices. I thought she was very knowledgeable. I remember going in for my saline sonagram and it was painful, I was overwhelmed with emotion, and she took a moment, to comfort me and make sure I was ok before she left.  Dr. Drews was compassionate and understanding at every turn. I always felt better after an appointment with him, understanding what was in the future and with all the information I needed to make a decision for my family.Dr Hong is excellent but the setup at RMA of NJ is very impersonal and doesn't make for optimal patient experience. Dr. Molinaro always explained everything perfectly and in a way that I could best understand. He listened and always took into consideration my questions. He was kind, compassionate and respectful. I always felt like I was in great care and that my outcome was important to him. dr Paul bergh is the absolute best in his field.  He has a professional bedside manor, he went above and beyond to make our dreams of having a baby a reality.   He put me in a pilot study with acupuncture not once but twice   He didn’t have to do this, he is so kind and caring.  I can’t thank him enough nor can I find enough good to say about him. Doctor is very caring and discussed every treatment in detail and the potential risks.
For every cycle there is some improvement !
In between cycle he made sure that everything is good before the treatment cycle.
E.g.- even when there is one polyp , he wanted to get rid of that. Before the cycle.
We feel we are in safe hands with the doctor.

Dr. Kim was was great. I got the results I wanted quickly so I did not need to see him often. He was surprised at how good my eggs were and said I had the eggs of a 34 year old. I trusted him with all procedures. He’s kind, empathetic, well-versed, smart, and covers many options/concerns. We were nervous but he calmed us. He even suggested a therapist for sex therapy since he recognized how difficult infertility could be on a marriageMy twins are now 12 years old. But I remember my experience with Dr Drews was very positive.  He was always professional and did not rush me out of the office. There were only a couple of times when he was not present when I needed to be seen.  
Dr. Scott was a small part of a large team of doctors and nurses in this office. I met with him at the beginning of this process and my communication was most directly with my assigned nurse who I spoke with almost daily. I was a seasoned IVF patient at the point I moved to RMA, and went to the office because of their success rate.Dr. Werner is attentive and patient and incredibly reassuring. For the first time in five years of fertility work, we had a doctor ask US what our ideal treatment cycle would look like. I trust her and feel heard by her more than any other doctor we've worked with.She was compassionate , very clear,encouraging, that the best things I like about her.
She is very energized . I think she did good combination of medication,  my hormone level were good during the whole treatment. I am expecting to complete the treatment soon and I am positive t get the right answer.I have Only been going here for a few months, but so far I have all great things to say! The staff is friendly, the clinic itself is super clean, and I always leave with my questions answered. I am hoping to start injectables VERY soon - we have one little set back that we need to get through first. She's very compassionate, caring and thorough.  Makes you feel like she understands your issues, emotions and hopes.  She sometimes needs to be pushed to explain things a bit better, but that's not unusual.  Great doctor.He was very honest and candid while still respecting my wishes during the process. He helped me to consider donor eggs and now I am the mother to two children. I could not be happier with my experience. He is very knowledgeable and professional. I put my full trust in him. I wouldn't say he exuded warmth but he did care.  Dr. Forman is knowledgeable and realistic.  He didn't give me false hopes.  I found him easy to understand.There are not enough words in the English language to describe how wonderful Dr Drews, I'm externally grateful for everything that he has provided for me and my familyHe was a good doctor, knew what he was talking about, was happy to explain things to me, and did not mind being asked questions or explaining his reasoning for things.  He did not act like every question I had was questioning his ""authority"" as a doctor.  This was not the case with previous REs.  The only thing that I did not like was that he suggested transferring two donor egg embryos.  I wanted eSet and he was fine with that.I had a great experience with Dr. Forman. He was very patient and always explained everything thoroughly. He made the experience as seamless as possible and was very sensitive to my emotions. He was thorough, calming and made you feel comfortable.  The first FET didn't stick, well... it was a chemical pregnancy.  After that he gave me his cell phone number and consulted with me on the next steps for a successful round.  You don't get that much from doctors so I really appreciate it.  He seemed like he truly cared. I would definitely recommend him to anyone!She was very sincere and tries to make an effort to see her patients. They are very busy so that was not always possible but the other doctors on staff there are just as wonderfulHe held my hand every step of the way showed great compassion while making me feel like I was in the hands of a brilliant doctor. He showed the right balance of confidence and caution. He never over promised anything but always said "" we are going to get you out of here with a baby""She was very professional and nice. More professional than nice, but she is really talented at what she does. You there to make a baby, not make a best friend....I would go to her again & would definitely recommend her to others. I am still currently under the care of Dr. Doherty. I just started my cycle but so far he has been an amazing doctor.She is personable and I like her. She has good training and I trust her.He is a compassionate, kind, and knowledgeable doctor. We had many IUI cycles with him (a lot were cancelled because of overstimulation), and two (successful) IVF cycles. He was kind, took his time with us, and accomplished what we set out to do… get pregnant. Dr. Bergh made me feel very comfortable and confident that I would get pregnant.He was always warm and compassionate and made sure he was available to answer all questions Dr. Werner is the absolute best! I would recommend her to anyone that is struggling with fertility issues. From the moment my husband and I started our fertility journey she always made us feel so comfortable and confident in her knowledge and skills. I struggle with anxiety and obviously going through fertility treatments and issues can add to anxiety, Dr. Werner was amazing at addressing my anxiety and making me feel at ease and comfortable through every process and step of our fertility journey. Dr. Werner literally made all our dreams come true and we cannot thank her enough for that!When I made the appointment with this clinic I thought the doctor would be the one who does all of my monitoring which I have not seen him since I started the cycle.  This cycle with injectable medications I only had one follicle I told him that next cycle I would like to increase my dose but he said that he will not do that in fear of multiples even though we are willing to take the risk.  Not sure how to evaluate the outcome as I'm still in my 2ww.  Positive thing about the clinic is that they do back-to-back iui's which increases the chances...
I only went to Dr Drews for a consultation. During that consultation - I was impressed by how thoroughly he memorized my patient history (I sent a lot of records from previous doctors). However - I felt that he just lectured me about his proposed path for our fertility, and did not try to understand my husband and I's approach towards family building. He forced us towards the donor egg route - saying we could only start treatment at RMA if we started going down the donor eggs concurrently to trying with my own eggs. As a result we decided not to go with RMA.She is blunt and realistic in a way I appreciated. She is kind, compassionate and wants the best for her patients. I could tell she works very hard and very dedicated she does this to help build families because she loves hers so much.She made eye contact, spoke clearly and honestly, and fielded our many questions with patience. She was upfront about success rates, which are low for us, and which were not explained to us when we did IUI and IVF in the other clinics we went to. He was very informative and knowledgeable. Made me feel comfortable. I trust he had me on the Best Protocol and made proper adjustments as necessary. Just wish I would have been able to have more of a one on one relationship with him. hardly saw HimDr. Molinaro is hands-on and guides you through every aspect of the fertility journey.  He has overseen my two pregnancies and has gone above and beyond to help me get to that point.  I felt like I was in excellent hands, especially at my last transfer where extra time was taken to ensure I had every chance of a successful implantation.  I am extremely grateful for Dr. Molinaro and his staff for making our dream of having a family become a reality.Dr. Gulati is very kind compassionate and forthcoming with her patients. Although this can be a demerit for some doctors, Dr. Gulati.  Is very compassionate and empathetic to each patient’s needs and strives to meet the patients needs based on the needs of each individual. She has great bedside manners which is a plus.Dr. Scott is extremely knowledgeable.  He has immense amount of experience and knowledge.  After visiting two other practices we were extremely pleased with him.  We were pleased with how well he listened, provided suggestions, and was honest with us. We have been with Dr. Werner since we got to RMA and from the beginning she has been wonderful. Before I got to RMA I suffered a 2nd trimester miscarriage with no know reason for the loss and an ectopic pregnancy, so you can imagine that when we got to RMA we were pretty broken. From the moment we walked into Dr. Werner’s we knew we were in the right hands. She was able to get figure out our issues and we had answers our questions. Throughout the process she was kind and compassionate, but always upfront about our issues. I always had a lot of questions and she was always willing to answer them. Very kind and compassionate. Great doctor - always thoroughly explains what’s next and adjust our course of action. I feel very comfortable with her and feel she truly cares about her patients and wants success for them Dr. Fischer is one of the most brilliant and compassionate doctors I have ever worked with. She has a completely intuitive understanding of reproductive hormones and is incredibly motivated to achieve good outcomes for her patients, in line with their goals. She always knew every detail of my past and present cycles and never failed to offer new ideas and approaches when we faced disappointing results. She has the perfect disposition of cautious optimism that is very well-suited to an REI specialist.Dr. Treiser was professional and explained what I needed to know about the procedure and my condition.  She was skilled in understanding how my condition would effect fertility and was detailed in giving me what I needed to know about how to proceed medically. He was very thorough in his explanation and never suggested which we should take as he was very respectful that we needed to make the choice best for us, but he gave us all the info to do so based off our situation.  Dr. Franasiak is a scientist.  He explores all options and explains them to you.  He is on the cutting edge of the science.  Dr. Franasiak set realistic expectations and did a nice job of managing expectations.  At low times I was confident we would work together to find a solution. Dr. Shastri took a good amount of time to talk to me at the outset.  I like her style and approach, which is direct but still compassionate. She practices with RMA, and in order to have doctors available 7 days a week (and on a schedule that works great for me) I see different doctors for my monitoring and procedures.  It gives me comfort that I won’t miss something due to scheduling issues, given how this process works and how important timing is.  Dr.Fischer will hold a special place in my heart.  After two miscarriages before getting treatment I am pregnant thanks to Dr.Fischer. I had one retrieval with only one surviving PGS normal embryo that was transferred. I am very thankfully for Dr.Fischer.   She is a great doctor and always there for any questions or concerns. She is very positive but also tells you how it is which is exactly what I wanted.  When I lost my baby she was calling me to check up on me and then had me in her office to try to explain what had happened and how to move forward.  It was very reassuring, and that is exactly whatI couldn’t imagine having been on this journey with anyone other than Dr. Werner and the entire team at RMA. Each professional handled our circumstance with the utmost compassion, genuinely taking interest in making our dream of conceiving a reality. I always felt truly heard, understood and that my best interest was at the core of each decision and progression. I will forever be grateful for Dr. Werner, Samantha, and the whole RMA-Eatontown team. Dr Kaiser takes time to go over every fine detail. He always made me feel like i was his most important person at the time of my appointment. He always followed through with what he said. I always left my visit confident with a plan and all my questions answered.The best aspect I really appreciate is the positivity,  this treatment is stressful and you someone who can stand with you and give you hope, it give you strength and faith and give you more chances to succeed. He always called me himself with both good and bad news. He kept positive and did two out of three transfers himself. He spent time helping me understand all peocedures and options. And support me on this two year journey.From our first visit, Dr. Fischer was very supportive and caring. She listened to all our issues and concerns and answered every single question we had. Dr. Fischer then proposed a treatment route and made sure we understood and were on board with it. We always felt that she had our best interest in mind, knowing that this is a very expensive treatment and she always offered the best alternative to us. She understands the stress and rollercoaster of emotions of going under fertility treatments. Though, to me the process was definitely easier just  knowing that Dr. Fisher was there for us.

 Dr. Fischer also explained the risks of each decision and cautioned us about all the outcomes. We went to her office a few times before starting the treatment and she was always very patient and caring towards us, she would always call back when we needed to ask some specific questions. We were under her care for about two years, and I’m finally 14 weeks pregnant through IVF. We certainly wouldn’t be able to go through all the process if it wasn’t for Dr. Fisher personalized care and expertise. We still have one embryo left at the clinic and I couldn’t imagine going through all the process again without Dr. Fisher.Dr. Fischer was personable and friendly. She explained everything clearly and was willing to answer and clarify any and all questions. During cycles, Dr. Fischer checked in on how I was doing and feeling and always made herself available to speak to me personally if I was concerned. She helped me stay positive with her positive energy and determination to make this work. She is truly amazing and would not hesitate to recommend her to someone seeking fertility options!After having 3 consecutive miscarriages, my husband and I chose to do IVF to check for chromosomal abnormalities in our embryos. We've now have a 3 yr old, a 1 year old and a 3rd one on the way. Dr. M was very helpful and accessible throughout the whole process. He has such a calming and positive presence. It was so reassuring to get to see him and talk to him throughout the entire journey and know that he was just an email or call away if I had questions. I would definitely recommend him to anyone seeking treatment. My husband and I couldn't have asked for a better doctor for this journey! We always felt fully informed and that she had our best interests in mind. If there were hesitations to make a decision, Dr. Fischer called us to talk everything through until we felt confident in the next steps. I liked that she didn't put my body through more than necessary with her medication plan and transfer.I was told a gestational carrier would be my best option to have my first child, but here I am, with a one year old, and one on the way. I was determined to become a mom. I wasn't going to give up until my doctor told me it wasn't going to happen -then I was going to get a new doctor- but I didn't have to.  Dr. Molinaro kept adjusting the protocol and trying something new. He never have up on me. Dr. Werner was kind and compassionate. When we first started we thought we would be in and out in a month or two, then when that did not happen. We were disappointed and needed to talk about options and receive more education. Once this occurred and we took a few months off of care, we were all fully in together and the results came out positive!She treated me in a personal manner and understood my history. She was very caring and has great bedside manner. When I went through my miscarriage she personally to apologize and give me all of the details of my next steps (D&C, naturally or pills). She checked in with me several times after my procedure as well. I do wish I would have seen her more, as we are rotated through doctors for early morning monitoring. She answered all of my questions quickly and efficiently and was very transparent. Even her office was quick to respond. She is respectful and friendly, and clearly always has our best interest at heart. Wonderful doctor all around!Dr. Constantini is great at her job, she loves what she does and she strives very hard for the best results. She’s honest about her expectations. The only thing I wish is that I would see her on every appointment. I appreciated that every time I left an appointment with Dr. Jurema, we had a plan for moving forward. I never felt unsure or in the dark.  He never made my chances of achieving pregnancy seem impossible or improbable.  Jamie was very caring. She made me feel comfortable. She was aggressive with the treatment and got right to the point. If IVF was covered she would have had us go right to IVF but since it was not she recommended trying 2 IUI cycles. Both which failed but she was a great dr. I loved Dr. Molinaro, he took the time to explain everything thouroghly and always checked to see if I had questions. I appreciated when he called me personally to tell me I was experiencing a  chemical pregnancy after my second transfer. We already had an appointment set to problem solve but he wanted to make sure he was available if I had questions before then. I truly felt that he was as invested as we were in each cycle.Nice, thorough and compassionate dr. We’ve seen a few dr. to date none of them gave us the feeling they actually thinking out of the box to get to the bottom of our prob and looking for a solution out side the regular protocol. We recently started with her but feel very optimistic and that we are in a good hands. The surgery she recommended seems to be justified and was successful. Dr. Kim and entire staff of RMA treated me with empathy, kindness and excellent attention to detail. I was never made to feel like another statistic/number, I believe my doctor and nurse sincerely cared for the outcome of my treatment.Dr. Foreman is very matter-of-fact. It was not that he didn't have a warm bedside manner, but he did not sugar coat things. For this reason, some may feel that he is cold but my husband and I appreciated his candid nature. Dr Treiser tries to be somewhat personable. Shes pleasant but sticks to the facts with little hand holding.I didn't have any complaints regarding my care until the acquisition of IVF NJ by RMA NJ.
RMA was strictly all business and they herded everyone around like cattle. They were almost rude to my husband and myself because we had to bring our twins for an appointment. They should make a waiting room for parents that's as comfortable as the main waiting area. My husband and the girls had to wait in a tiny room that was claustrophobic. One time I went for an appointment and waited an hour + to be called. RMA said they didn't realize that I was waiting. Despite signing in and saying good morning to everyone. 
There is absolutely no privacy at RMA. You get herded around with a group. There's maybe 6-8 women getting blood work at the same time. I had to STAND in a long corridor with at least 10 other women and some of their partners while waiting for an ultrasound. And you can hear everything through the doors.When I first became a patient of Dr. Forman, I had already seen several other doctors who did not provide me with any solutions to the unique situation I was in. Dr. Forman took the time to understand exactly what I had been going through and was the first doctor to offer me a solution. 

I had to undergo several procedures and each time Dr. Forman or other RMA doctors were extremely friendly and caring. Following my procedures I always received a call from my nurse who was checking in to see how I was feeling. 

Throughout my IVF cycle Dr. Forman was very helpful and would answer any E-mails I sent at any time of day. This truly showed me how dedicated he was to his patients. My nurse was also very dedicated during the cycle, always making sure I was clear on next steps.There was excellent communication.  At our initial consult, Dr. Kim explained everything in such detail and made sure we understood what was going on.  Once testing and treatment started, my nurse was an amazing resource and would contact me sometimes multiple times a day to update me and check on how I was doing.Dr Morris took it upon herself to research a genetic disorder my husband and I are both carriers for. She made she I was aware of the risks of transferring a girl and wanted me to know she was in my corner no matter what I chose. She personally called me to find out my choice of whether to do a blind transfer or know the gender of the embryo. Dr. Costantini always took the time to answer my questions.  We had a few months between our consultation/testing and our first procedure because I was unsure how to proceed.  Dr. Costantini took the time to answer all my questions. My questions about the fertility procedure, scientific rationale and risk/benefit behind each treatment were adequately answered by Dr. FormanDr. Forman is both kind and direct. He gives you his honest opinions and is very clear about what the process will look like. I never felt like another number and always felt that Dr. Forman cared about getting pregnant.Dr. Forman was great, he took his time to explain my condition and create a plan just for me. He was monitoring my treatments and communicated with the nurses to provide the best care possible. Dr. Forman diagnosed me with PCOS which caused my infertility, this was easily treated.  It took me 3 IUI's and 1 year to finally get pregnant. I am now 8 weeks and 4 days and my baby is growing healthy and happy. Thank you Dr. Forman for giving us our little miracle. She called me when things got rough but not before then. He was friendly and approachable. He took the time to meet with me, had clearly read my long infertility history.Dr Forman would spend time with you... We did a frozen embryo transfer with frozen embryos from NYU. He would call be back after hours on his cell if I had a question- very comfortingDr. Doherty is a very kind man, he listens to you, checks in to make sure everything is okay and makes sure you are comfortable.He sat down with me and got to know me. I felt like it was truly personalized care.Dr. Werner is the absolute best! I would recommend her to anyone that is struggling with fertility issues. From the moment my husband and I started our fertility journey she always made us feel so comfortable and confident in her knowledge and skills. I struggle with anxiety and obviously going through fertility treatments and issues can add to anxiety, Dr. Werner was amazing at addressing my anxiety and making me feel at ease and comfortable through every process and step of our fertility journey. Dr. Werner literally made all our dreams come true and we cannot thank her enough for that!At our initial consultation we sat down and discussed all the testings and the treatments that I had done and my options for a future. He was very understanding of our situation Dr.Fischer personally called me with results on numerous occasions. She was always available if I had any questions.Before coming to RMA Marlton and seeing Dr. Franasiask, we had been under the care of three previous fertility doctors. These previous doctors relied more on ""herd medicine"" and one-size-fits all treatments rather than personalized diagnosis and care. This amounted to 4 years of multiple rounds of IUI, IVF, surgery, and lost hope. 

When we showed up to our first meeting with Dr. Franasiak, he had all of our records printed out on his desk (probably about 6 inches high, of which he had read every page). In discussing our case, it was clear he had thoroughly taken the time to understand everything we had been through and he was prepared to recommend a diagnosis and treatment program before we walked in. He listened to and thoroughly and honestly addressed every question we had, including further nuances to our diagnosis and treatment plan. I felt like a human because Dr Kaser knew me, knew my situation, and was extremely informed about what my situation was and what was best for me. He answered my questions and concerns and provided me with advice I could trust because I knew he cared about me and what I was going through. We had our retrieval before thanksgiving and our transfer the day after Christmas, and Dr Kaser and his staff were so sympathetic to how this process must have felt around a holiday. Dr Kaser also performed another procedure on me to remove a polyp and I could tell he felt the urgency we felt to get this done so we could move on to the transfer. You could see he and his staff wanted us to conceive as badly as we wanted to.  Dr. Maguire has been a game changer during this process. She’s kind and gentle but professional and informative. She calls me personally and always starts with a personal question (how was my weekend, how’s my husband doing, etc). I couldn’t be happier with her.She was flexible in scheduling and was kind, patient, and thorough when we met. We originally had decided on RMA because of a specific doctor. Half way through or first failed cycle - when calling to let us know that no embryos made it - he also let us know he’d be leaving to start another clinic in Cali. Which was something everyone at RMA knew when we started our first cycle. They attempted to push us on to another doctor that I met with and felt very uncomfortable with and we had to insist on seeing Dr.Drews who was recommended to us as the “ best doctor at the clinic” - it was a battle to even have a choice in what doctor we saw after they roped us in. The first round I’d like to add was botched - medications were not ordered - lack of contact - only saw the first doctor three times from the entire cycle. He did nothing but read results from a paper. Doctor Drews acknowledged in our first meeting this mistakes that were made by the first doctor and assured us he’d give us a different protocol for the second round. During the second round it was nearly impossible to see Dr.Drews. He didn’t even call us to share our results that this round was not successful - our nurse did and told us if we wanted to know why we could schedule to see him. I called several times to get an appointment with him and was told I’d have to wait about a month to even speak with him. When we did get to see him he gave us absolutely no definitive answers - he blamed smoking ( Neither of us are smokers ) he said it could be from medications but absolutely not one answer as to why. He then proceeded to push doner eggs. We both stated that It’s not something we’d want to do. He continued to push and even said “ oh that’s what they all say I’m sure after a few years of trying unsuccessfully you’ll be back for the doner eggs”. I only saw/spoke doctor Drews twice during the entire cycle. Not available for questions,  concerns, did not give any helpful information.  I felt like a number at RMANJ for the following reasons:
1. The first nurse I was assigned would literally sigh when answering my calls and on several occasions missed critical points in my care necessitating me to call and follow up.
2. Having had such a bad experience with the nurse I asked the doctor for her email. I was trying to improve the impersonal experience I was having with a grumpy nurse. Dr. Chu would never provide me her email let alone phone number. I had NO avenue to ever contact my doctor directly. All questions about my care had to go through a third party (nurse) who could care less about my care. I was one of the 200 patients she was dealing with at one time.
3. Of the three calls I received with my pregnancy test results NOT A SINGLE ONE was from my dedicated nurse. The calls always came from a complete stranger.
4. Nurses got changed mid-cycle without my opinion or consultation. I had three cycles and roughly six to seven nurses over that time. Most nurses at least let me know they were changing. One got promoted and never told me. I got a call from a random nurse the next day telling me she is my new nurse when I never even know I lost my last one.

IVF is a trying time and a lot of details are involved in your care. When patients are thrown around like a hot potato I think it's easy to miss key details; not to mention theres ZERO relationship made and you're literally a number.During monitoring with other doctors scheduled for that day, I felt like a number. When I had my IUIs,  Dr Shefali Shastri did not perform any of them. Other doctors that I have never met before performed the IUIs. I felt like a number with the other doctors. I can tell they did not take the time to review my chart to get to know my case a little more. I understand they have other patients to tend to. However going through this emotional rollercoaster journey of fertility, I felt Dr Shastri should have been the one to perform my IUIs. There were a few times Dr Shastri did do the monitoring because she was scheduled for that day. Other than that, Dr Shastri does have a great positive energy and great bedside manners. I wish she did my IUIs. Maybe they would have worked. I am always treated like I’m Dr. C’s top priority. She always wants to see me specifically when I went in for monitoring appointments. You can tell Dr. Shastri cares. She personally made phone calls when the news was not good. She continues to give us hope.Even though RMA is a large practice, I never felt like a number. Dr Rauch always made me feel like i was her patient and even ensured that I was on her monitoring schedule. Even though RMA is huge, Dr. Chu was always genuinely happy to see me or talk to me and never rushed me out of the room. She always remembered me and the things we talked about. Dr. C and I clicked immediately; she respects that I’ve been through a lot of prior treatment, and appreciates that I’m an involved and informed patient. She takes my wants, needs, and thoughts into consideration and I really feel like we are all collaborating.I was treated good but felt like they could have explained things better as the process went along.He emailed me after our consult and at other points during treatment and called me to discuss our options once my eggs were stimulated and we could see I still repeated what I had done previously and only had about 3 large follicles. He really looked at our situation and gave us his honest opinion and statistics as to why he thought that way. Dr. Costantini definitely makes me feel like a human. She is very patient and thorough. Never makes me feel rushed. You would think she has all the time in the world. Dr. Kaser and my nurse have been so patient in answering all of my questions (which took an hour and a half before signing my consents) and keeping regular contact during my care.He really cares and spends time explaining and makes the patient comfortable Starting with our initial consult, Dr. Franasiak made us feel like more than a number, and like actual people. He had great bed-side manner, yet was always up front with us in regards to what we were facing with Secondary Unexplained Infertility. He was always understanding of our feelings, and justified our frustrations. 

Another aspect that we really enjoyed/appreciated about RMA, is that we had our own nurse, and she was AMAZING! She always expressed genuine concern about how we were doing, and offered her assistance in whatever we needed along the way. We went to a previous infertility clinic and did not receive anywhere near the same personal care.We first went to our consult with Dr. Thomas Molinaro and he wanted to know everything in our past, he explained EVERYTHING,  and made me feel so much more comfortable with the treatments we were about to undergo. He made sure I understood everything and gave me a sense of confidence that everything was going to go well. It has been a long road so far and for the first time I feel like things are going somewhere. Insurance is covering only $1,000 and we have every opportunity to shop around for cheaper treatment but as comfortable he made us feel I would find a way just to continue to see him. I would recommend him to anyone I know who is struggling with fertility! Dr. Bergh has great bedside manner. He remembered me from my initial visits five years prior and offered great support as I decided between two paths to motherhood. Dr Molinaro is straightforward but kind. He isn't pushy in his recommendations and goes through all your options so you feel like you actually have a say in the process. His office is very friendly and I'm always able to get a hold of someone no matter what. That's a huge differentiator here. Knowing that my nursing team understands what I need during this process too.Dr Bergh took the time to talk to me individually and explain the treatment process and why he was opting to do that process over others.  Dr Kaser is compassionate and has great bed side manner.  He took on my infertility case after 1 failed and 1 ectopic cycle.  He was thorough and took his time with me.  He is honest and down to earth.   After many morning monitoring visits, I became a familiar face to the nurses and staff. They greet me with a smile, call me by my name, and answer all of my questions. Dr. Franasiak was always willing and available to answer questions or concerns, even returning phone calls late at night. He has a very empathetic bedside manner.He is extremely personable and warm. He draws pictures and explains thoroughly to ensure you understand. He is also very empathetic.Dr. Fischer was extremely kind, answered all my questions, scheduled extra phone calls when I wanted to, and was also extremely positive even when we received what I thought was discouraging news. She pointed out reasons for hope and optimism and was encouraging the whole way.Dr. Molinaro had a great bedside manner and positive attitude. IVF is a difficult journey and he made it all much easier. He was also very realistic and tactful when setting expectations. He answered all my questions promptly and was great at explaining the more ""technical"" aspects of the treatment in a way I could easily understand. 
Even though RMANJ is a large group and I mostly went to Basking Ridge for monitoring, I never felt like a number. During the IVF process I got to interact with different Doctors, nurses and staff. Everybody was very nice and respectful. Such a compassionate doctor, with warm bedside manner. Being a mother and a parent is important to her, and obviously translates so well to the work that she does in infertility. I find this perspective to be important with infertility patients who are yearning to become parents themselves, through all of the challenges.Dr. Catha Fischer is a sweetheart, always so kind and positive. I never felt a negative vibe from her.She was very involved and each time I visited the clinic I got to speak with her in person. She speaks very quickly but it felt like that was just her personality. I never felt rushed by her, and she took the time to answer all of my questions in detail.Dr. Doherty was an unbelievable doctor while I was under his care, there were days when I wanted to give up and he pushed me through it all. As well as my nurse Kira Nickerson. They both never made me feel like a number but as a patient in desperate need of help. I am currently pregnant and so excited because of them. Dr. Molinaro took the time to get to know my husband and I and to listen to what we had experienced and what we wanted.  He always took the time to explain each fertility option and listened and answered all questions and concerns.  He always followed up and checked in for the good and bad.  He called personally and talked me through some very difficult times. Dr. Hong without a doubt treated me like a human...and not just a human, but one she wanted to help and see happy.  She always talked to me about my individual situation and not how it compared with anyone else's or any statistics.  She took the time to call me outside of her work time and reassure me when I was feeling anxious and overwhelmed.After my initial consultation and all the blood work and testing, I was ready to get started.  The doctor had my assigned nurse (who was lovely) call to tell me that the doctor wanted me to lose 20 to 25 lbs before starting IUI.   They set me up with their nutritionist on staff, who was also lovely.  After I lost almost 20 lbs, I was told I was close but not quite there.  During the almost two years that I wasted trying to lose weight (which eventually all was gained back) the doctor never once scheduled a meeting or call to check in.  I wasted two years and i did not have two years to waste.RMA is a large clinic so it was pretty easy to get lost in the shuffle. I did have good communication with my nurse and was able to speak with Dr Chu when I wanted to. Dr. Jurema was very caring and compassionate and took the time to explain the reasoning behind choices.  For example when I was concerned about options on the paperwork about embryo storage he called me and talked me through it.The nurse coordinator, Hillary, would return my phone calls in a timely manner and answer all of my questions. The office is very efficient - but each time I met with a doctor or nurse - they took the time to speak with me, to provide answers and to comfort me.  Also, results were always received so quickly - my nurse was always touching base with me.Dr. Bergh took the time to discuss all options and answer my questions patiently.  I was assigned a specific nurse who was always available for me specifically.  I felt very much like my team knew me and my situation.She seemed to care about my situation and outcome. She followed-up a couple of times after the cycle failed.  There doesn't seem like there is a lot of customization of protocols. Its not really a holistic approach to fertility treatment.Dr. Hong has a really nice approach and 'bedside manner' - each interaction that we've had has been a reassuring experience. She's very detailed and takes time to explain everything and answer questions. She's highly approachable, kind, and responsive, even in between appointments. She called me directly when it was needed to explain any major change in my treatment plan. Dr. Morris, Nurse Michelle and her staff were wonderful. We always understood the path for our treatment and her calm understanding and teams constant communication made a very intense process as stress free as possible.Dr. Kaser took the time to explain the process and answer all my questions no matter how trivial. He was personable, had a great sense of humor throughout the process and I knew that he genuinely cared. RMA can be very clinical - you do feel like a number there.  Dr. Chu and the rest of the team at Englewood do their best to treat you like a “human”.  Honestly, it depends on my mood.  Many times I’m frustrated that I am there, dealing with this situation and there really is no amount of personable care that would make it feel less sterile.  It’s the situation in itself that makes the process feel like this.  I don’t believe Dr. Chu is responsible for my feelings though.Out of all the doctors I've worked with at four different clinics Dr. Molinaro is the only one that provided his direct email address and was reachable by phone without having to go through many people. When things were time sensitive, Dr. Molinaro always replied to emails promptly (usually within the same day) or called back on the same day. I was able to put my trust in Dr. Molinaro which was a relief after the experiences I had with doctors at other clinics. Doctor Doherty speaks in a very professional yet soft tone. His bedside manner is one of the best I have ever had with any doctor. He explains everything and makes you feel comfortable. Any concerns he is willing to answer questions. I have had a few concerns since starting and with some of the tests and his office and nurse are on top of getting back to me. I am looking forward to working with him
More and confident he will accomplish what may be the impossible. He is realistic and smart and straight to the point I wouldn’t want it any other way. Dr. Drew’s is an excellent doctor with extensive knowledge about infertility. I feel he gets to the point and explains in detail what you need to know about the IVF process as well as what to expect. I do not feel he treats his patients like a number. She was so nice. Listened to and answered all our questions. She remembered details about our life from appointment to appointment. She was pregnant herself while we were doing our treatments, and she didn't call attention to it at all, wore her lab coat to hide her bump. Didn't touch it. Was very respectful of all our feelings. I can't say enough about how warm she was.Dr. Molinaro takes the time to answer all of our questions. He calls to check up on us and in general his bedside manner is such that we feel he truly cares about us and is deeply committed to getting us to our goal.Dr. Morris is very personable and really cares about the patient, both myself and my husband. She is very sympathetic and honest throughout the whole process.Dr. Morris was very warm and friendly - she would call me directly if I had questions.  If she was in the room when my nursed called me, she would say hello in the background. Dr. Hong was the best doctor I have every worked with.  I do not believe I would have gotten through my journey without her by my side.  She was extremely caring and I felt like she was looking out for me.  I truly felt that she was fighting the fight with me.Dr M always took time to answer my questions. He also reached out via email or phone calls after each appointment/test. The compassion and concern that Dr. Hong has for me cannot be overstated. She took her time to understand what I was going through as a cancer patient, was so caring, and even called to say Hi just to check on me and let me know she cared. A truly wonderful experience.I never felt uncomfortable talking to Dr. Werner about any of my concerns.  She never rushed us made us feel like we were ""just a number""  She took the time to explain our genetic disorder to us as well as the process of what we were about to embark on.  I never felt as if i was ""bothering"" her asking numerous questions. Dr. Molinaro’s bedside manner is better than any doctor I have ever seen.  He is sensitive to the difficulties of treating infertility, while at the same time honest and open about treatment and expectations.  He has personally called on a number of occasions to deliver results and has made himself available to meet whenever we request a meeting.Dr. Rybak always made it a point to make sure I was comfortable.  Even during morning monitoring he never rushed me and was empathetic to the circumstances and answered all questions.  He has even called me in between treatments (even on the weekend) to make sure that I was ""OK"" and that we were progressing as expected.Dr. Shefali is the most caring, compassionate doctor I've ever had. I don't think I could've gone through these last two years with a different doctor.Dr. Hock is wonderful. She is so kind, intelligent and truly treats me with such care. She knows how to communicate what is going on in a way that is understandable and clear. She has gone above and beyond for us. All the doctors we have experienced at RMA are that way. I cannot say enough good things about my experience with RMA and specifically Dr. Hock.Dr Yih was very straight forward.  She did explain things to us and did take the time we needed and were not rushed out of the office.  However, there were some very critical things that were over looked by her at the time of our first meeting which ultimately impacted our journey financially. Dr. Franasiak and my nurse explained each step of the process from the first appointment and followed up regularly even between visits to check in and make sure that I was doing ok.  Before we were able to start treatment we got pregnant on our own which turned out to be ectopic but my nurse and the doctor connected with me daily to see how I was feeling and as we get ready to move forward with treatment they have been very supportive, direct and detailedDr. Treiser made me feel like a human, as she was very warm, listened to my concerns and answered all of my questions. She was great and so supportive.Dr. Hong took the time to listen to me.  She also was very sympathetic.My name is always remembered by all involved. I am always greeted warmly and family is asked about. Nurses follow up with me and make sure all is understood.Dr. Shastri is extremely kind and warm. She hugs me every time she sees me, which some people might not like, but I appreciate it as a single woman going through this process. She has been very sensitive and very available to me. He prayed with us 
He laughed with us
He personally called me after a negative pregnancy test
He related to our religious needs
He delt with compassion and honesty
He was there for us every minute of our long journey
And upon discharge he shook my husband hand firmly with a huge smile on his face. We will see you again for your next baby. Dr Hong was kind yet direct, and very adaptive. She carefully considered responses to questions and was honest when there wasn’t an answer she could provide. She is very kind, the type of doctor that offers you a hug, always give eye contact, never lets you feel like a question is irrelevant or stupid. She has called me, while she was on vacation.Dr. Franasiak does an excellent job explaining each step of our testing, diagnosis, and treatments.  He utilizes his nursing staff to maintain excellent patient communication, instruction, and check-ins throughtout each stage.  Looking forward to a successful IUI (hopefully this cycle) now that the likely cause of infertility has been identified and treated.She has a warm manner. The way she’s interacted with me made me feel like she really cared about the outcome of my treatment. Dr Maguire’s bedside manner is kind and patientJamie Morris has done a wonderful job of clearly and succinctly summarizing our options for fertility treatment (IUI, IVF), as well as explaining the IUI process once we decided to proceed with that. However, I would have appreciated/benefited from some more information regarding follow up. After the IUI procedure was performed, I didn't receive any further information on what I should be or could be doing to help boost our chances for success, she exited the room fairly quickly. Everyone in the office was so caring and supportive throughout.  It was clear that they care about the patients and making sure they stay positive through a difficult time.  Not only the doctor, but the nurses, assistants, and administrative staff all made me feel this way.  I couldn't have chosen a better place for this treatmentDr Molinaro always took time to answer questions I had, respond to emails I sent, and proactively reach out to see how I was doing throughout my cycles.  I even went for monitoring at another office where he was covering for the day, and he went out of his way to find me to see how I was doing.  His positive attitude and honesty was always reassuring. It's definitely a larger clinic, so I cannot say every time I went in for monitoring I felt like a human. However, during every one-on-one with doctor (and even when I saw my doctor for monitoring) I felt better informed and treated as a person.I am still early in the process with Dr Molinaro but he performed my HSG testing and had a detailed consultation with me. He answered all of my questions in a detailed way and made sure I get comfortable with the path forward. Dr. Ryback always explained the procedure and wanted to know how I was doing and feeling. He always had a smile on his face and never felt rushed During monitoring I felt like a number because there were so many women, and the doctor doesn’t spend much time with the patient. The doctor himself was amazing though so I feel neutral about the time spent. 
The nursing staff was incredible and always reachable Dr Hong is amazing.  She did both retrieval’s and FET for me.  Most people in the clinic don’t have their own doctors do them.  My second retrieval was abdominal.  It was really painful and dr Hong was amazing.  I called and she called me back after hours. I went to the office on Sunday and there was another doctor covering because dr Hong was doing transfers.  Dr Hong made a special point to come up and look at me. I received the heart breaking news last Saturday that my FRozen embryo transfer was negative.  It was 1 out of my 2 pgs tested embryos.  I was devastated.  Dr Hong called me on Saturday while she was traveling to say how sorry she was.  I missed her call.  She called me back on Sunday to discuss what we can do differently and give me some hope.  I’m going oct 2nd to do a hysterscopy.  Then moving on to the ERA.  When I first met with dr Hong she was straight up telling me the good and bad because of my age of 43.  I wouldn’t want any other doctor to handle my IVf journey.  I would 100% recommended dr hong.  Dr. Doherty always took the time to speak with me. Ask me how I was doing, discuss any/all symptoms/questions/concerns! I felt like he truly cared!RMA-NJ is very factory-like in that you just show up at any of their clinics on the days that you are to be monitored and whoever is working there that day does your monitoring.  I like that they at least list the names of the doctors on the schedule so I can go to the clinics with the doctors I feel most comfortable with.   Generally all communication runs through one's assigned nurse by email and by phone messages, but any time I have specifically wanted to directly speak with my doctor Susan Treiser, I have been pleasantly surprised with how quickly and pleasantly she calls me back and speaks at length with me about whatever I want to talk to her about.   She has also called me, instead of having the nurse contact me, at key junctures in my treatment, and she is always the one to talk with me after retrieval and every step along the way in regards to embryo development and testing.   
There have been tests and medications I have read about and when I bring up a test or a medication adjustment I am wondering about, she has always had good information for me and seems to like talking with me, and has been open to my ideas and suggestions where appropriate.I have PCOS and am overweight, Dr. Shastri was very patient for our 1st year of treatment and just kept encouraging me to lose weight.  When we finally got cleared for our first treatment cycle, my mom passed away and a month later my father had open heart bypass surgery. During what was an extremely stressful time, Dr. Shastri was extremely supportive. She has encouraged us to continue healthy lifestyle choices and praises the loss we have achieved.Even though this is a big busy practice you do get to see Dr. Bergh and he was very candid and frank at the consultation. He told me right away that my best luck to get pregnant would be a egg donor or embryo donor. He did recommend I lose weight but was very professional about it.  I also told him that I had problems with pelvic floor disorder and these tests were tough for me. He was very professional about that as well. Never may me feel diminished in any way as a patient because of it. Allowed me to get the hysteroscopy done at the hospital under anesthesia.Dr Franasiak is a fantastic doctor. I am actually going back to see him again with my other 3 frozen embryos to try for baby #2. I wouldn’t see anyone else besides him. His other associates are good, but he needs to be the main dr on my case and calling the shots. He is so thoughtful and caring and he even set up a special time to meet my newborn son after all was said and done. He went above and beyond with me when I came down with a very rare skin rash and even held conferences with his staff to go over what my rash could be and even called me from his personal cell phone, on a weekend, to check up on me. He is an amazing doctor and I cannot day enough good things about him. While I only had a few appointments in which I formally sat down to speak with Dr. Jurema, it was always clear he had carefully reviewed my files and was familiar with the details of my diagnosis and care. Through calls and appointments, he made time to answer any questions I had. Throughout multiple procedures he was always optimistic, yet realistic - giving me as clear a picture as possible of what I could expect without trying to oversell anything. I also appreciated Dr. Jurema's approach to monitoring visits - entering the room slowly (vs. barging in), taking the time to ask how I was feeling, etc.Dr. Doherty took the time to get to know our specific situation. He understood that we had a male infertility issue and helped us figure out the best course of action to have our baby. Even though we did disagree on things such as having donor sperm as a back up, he really made us feel good about our situation. I'm  thrilled we chose him as our doctor and I look forward to trying for our second child soon. Every meeting, every email, every phone call Dr. Hong took time to explain the ins and outs of what was going on and what next steps would look like.  She made time whenever I was freaking out and never made excuses for not responding while also making every effort to calm my nerves.  She was flexible and easy to talk throughout all three of my cycles (and other treatment procedures).Dr. Rybak was always compassionate. He took the time to explain things. He made a point to reach out to me by phone.  During monitoring and communicating with the nurses it felt less personal.Dr. Treiser understood that I have an anxiety disorder, so she would be very frank with me and give me numbers, percentages, etc when she could, because that made me feel more in control/like I knew what to expect. When we had bad news, she would call me herself rather than letting the nurse call me. She also was the one to call us when we had good news as well. After my retrievals and transfer (done by Dr. Leo Doherty because of how the schedule fell), she called to check on me and see how I was doing. Also, after I was no longer a patient, I reached out to her about results on my first trimester screen to ask her opinion and she called me back the same day, and asked me to keep her updated. When I emailed her the results of my subsequent NIPT screening, she emailed me back the same day. Dr. Hong is an extremely dedicated and compassionate RE. I had a chemical pregnancy a week prior to the start of my IVF cycle. Dr. Hong actually called me to check in to make sure I was ok!  She has understood that I prefer detailed responses to my questions and has adjusted her approach accordingly.  Whenever I email Dr. Hong she responds within 24 hours. You never feel like a number with Dr Forman. He takes the time to answer all your questions - even  if you have million questions. He's always available by email. He is genuinely interested in your success and remembers your specific diagnosis/situation. After my initial consultation with Dr Forman and before I started treatment with him, I had a hysteroscopy scheduled at a different clinic. He reached out by email to see how the procedure went. Meant a lot to me. Dr. Forman was extremely thorough in explaining each step of my egg retrieval process.  I actually went to him for what I thought would only be a consultation but unexpectedly was diagnosed with DOR.  He was incredibly compassionate and caring and was always calm in explaining my options as I was completely overwhelmed.  Dr. Forman was readily available to answer all of my questions and he kept checking-up on me to ensure I was feeling well.  I was a nervous wreck the day I was scheduled for my retrieval and on top of it all, he was not on the schedule for that specific day to do my retrieval.  I was elated and surprised when the nurse told Dr. Forman was actually coming in that day to do MY retrieval!  He knew I was scared and anxious throughout the entire process and to ease my fears, he went above and beyond and out of his way to be MY doctor to do my retrieval (on a day that he wasn't even scheduled)!  Infertility challenges may be a very difficult and sensitive topic for some people; I spent most of the cycle crying and being stressed/frustrated/nervous/anxious - Dr. Forman did everything he could to keep me focused on the positives and I NEVER felt rushed when I went through my endless lists of questions.  Not only is he brilliant, but he is genuine and sincerely cares - he's an incredible doctor and exceptional person.Dr. Morris always made me feel at ease. She constantly checked with me during conversations to make sure I was ok (mentally and physically). She wanted to make sure I wasn't too overwhelmed. She even said if ever I felt too overwhelmed to call her and she would chat. She has called me to make sure I understood everything going on and that we were all on the same page.Dr. Forman treated both myself and my husband with the utmost care, concern, and respect. From moment one, Dr. Forman took the time to explain every step of the process (testing and treatment) and thoroughly answered all of our questions. He gave us the information we needed to make autonomous decisions and feel confident with our diagnosis, treatment, and possible outcomes. He and his staff were readily available via both phone and email whenever we had questions. We felt like our concerns and questions were just as important to him as they were to us.Dr. Forman was always very calm, reassuring, and extremely knowledgeable.  h He never made me feel like a number.  He truly loves what he does and is compassionate.  I never doubted his advice or recommendations and felt very confident that he was my fertility physician.  My RN Jennifer Graeve was also excellent and compassionate throughout my entire time with RMA.  
At times the morning monitoring was tough and made me feel like a number because there were so many people in the waiting room, especially on the weekends, but I am not sure if there is a way to fix that as the hours try to accommodate working women which I like.Felt like a human because he took the time to sit down and talk with us at every step of the process.  He was direct about our odds and still supportive of our making our own decision.  We were most appreciativee of his contacting us directly, instead of through a nurse, to provide results of retrieval, fertilization, and embryo progression.Dr. Doherty always took the time to answer the MANY questions we had and he always did it with a smile.  He is kind, caring, patient, and professional. Dr. Doherty made us feel like we were the only patients under his care and went above and beyond every step of the way. Doctor Hock always called me personally after bad news and discussed all our options. She answers every question in detail and is very kind but also very thorough. She has gotten to know me and my husband personally and seems to genuinely care about us.She listened to everything I had to say and she said it really helped her to fill in the kind of gaps you get from just reading the files, of the patients' actual personal experience along the way.  I felt like she really heard the agonizing journey we have already been through and acknowledged how difficult it has been.  She made a decision how best to proceed in our individual case with our best interests in mind.Dr Molinaro was hands on with my treatment, and stayed in contact every step of the way.   I never doubted our course of treatment or the results.  Dr drews is a very compassionate doctor. He has humanized me in every way during this painful process and though I have not ended up pregnant yet I feel he is personally committed to me Dr. Shefali Shastri really cares about her patients. She will take the time to give a call when needed to make sure that you are doing well emotionally and physically throughout the entire process. She is prompt in returning phone calls and answering any and all questions throughout the process. She is also there to support during times of disappointment or grief. She is an amazing doctor!I like that she called me personally with results and never rushed me when I was speaking with her in person. However, it felt like it took forever to get in touch with her because they are not always at the clinic and you are seeing a million different doctors during your monitoring.  Although she was my actual doctor, I never saw her much during the IVF process.The whole clinic staff is great.  They know me personally and are always very supportive and patient whenever I go in.  My assigned nurse, who calls me with test results and dosage instructions has been great, and even when there's a substitute, I never feel rushed through the information.  Dr. Forman has collaborated with me and my husband regarding our treatment, and has been sensitive to our financial situation as well.Dr. Hong took the time to really get to know me, my family and understand our wants and needs. She went out of her way after our miscarriage to help us understand why. She made sure then to take the lead on our care and future visits. Dr. Hong even went out of her way to make sure she personally could do my D&C. She knew my son's birthday was near and even got him a gift - so thoughtful and sweet! I highly recommend anyone who wants a personalize and human touch to see Dr. Hong. There are many doctors in the RMA practice. It's convenient when needing to schedule appointments, but morning monitoring felt like a chicken coup. You are just a number. I felt as though there could have been more testing on me, as I was not going through insurance, before making a huge investment in IVF.During the appointments I've had with her, Dr. Shastri has been concerned not only with how my treatment is progressing, but also with how I'm doing emotionally. She understands that this is a difficult process from a number of standpoints, and that comes through in how she talks about the entire process.Dr. Forman always address my concern and question, I might not see him in each morning monitor. But he had made sure he does my transfer and morning monitor since I had one failed FET that was not performed by him. I felt he wanted to make sure I got the care I need and he wanted to make sure he was there for me. Dr. Forman was patient and kind. He spent as much time with us as we needed.  He explained our treatment plan and options in a manner that was easy for us to understand. He was compassionate and caring.Dr. Forman has a nice relaxed way of communicating and he is always available to talk either by phone or email. He is quick to respond as well. He verbalizes understanding of what the couple is going through and offers what he feels is the best treatment option. Ears open and honest and does not create false hope.She did her research on my test results that were transferred over prior to my first appointment with her. She was compassionate and understanding of the emotional turmoil that I am dealing with. She was patient and explained everything to me a million times until it sunk in.Dr. Bergh and my nurse, Michelle have always given me the time and attention I need.  Answer my questions and meet with me to discuss options.I think he had a good combination of being frank about what we were dealing with but being sympathetic to the situationDr. Forman always answered all of our questions thoroughly and in a way in which we could understand. He set realistic expectations and made sure we were comfortable thoughout the entire process.Dr. Foreman was always available to answer any questions. He was quick to respond to emails and would also quickly set up a phone call when needed. I've never had a doctor that was that responsive. I felt he truly cared about his patient and wanted me to have the result that I wanted. I can't say enough good things about Dr.Foreman! He's a brilliant doctor, kind and real human being. Dr Forman made me feel like a human, and not a number, by calling me throughout the cycle .. remembering my name. Dr Forman was always available to answer any questions. Dr. Forman was very responsive to emails and always emailed us right before and after procedures (TESE, retrieval) to let us know how it went.Dr. Forman is an excellent reproductive endocrinologist.  At each appointment my husband and I had with him, he took his time, never rushed us, explained information very thoroughly, and had such a wonderful bedside manner.  There were times where he made special accommodations to see us at the very end of the day, due to my work schedule, and he personally called me prior to each egg retrieval/transfer, even if it was on a Saturday or Sunday. Dr. FOrman and his staff were always available, day or night to answer any of my questions or concerns.  Dr. Forman showed incredible patience with the millions of questions we had every step of the way. We never felt rushed, and he always left us feeling very comfortable to ask more questions. He was extremely responsive and always reachable, which was something we especially valued to a great degree.Dr Forman took person care of me. I really liked that he took his time to explain the IVF process and answered our questions when we first met him and didn't rush us. He took the time at nights and weekends to email us updates on our embryos. When we had a question he always is available to respond to any questions we had too.RMANJ was the second infertility clinic I visited after 6 months of failed treatment elsewhere.  One of the things I liked more about Dr. Molinaro was how he treated me and my husband like intelligent people (unlike the first place I wewnt, where every question I asked, I was answered like I was stupid and should've known the answer.) On our very first visit, Dr. Molinaro diagnosed my very obvious PCOS and we set a plan in place that my husband and I were comfortable with.  All of our questions were answered and we never felt rushed.Dr. Forman always treated me like an individual who mattered. He always made me feel like my health and safety were his first priority, and took time to explain each of his choices for my treatment. He was very easy to communicate with, responding rapidly to any e-mails and even calling on the phone. Dr. Forman reached out numerous times throughout the cycle to make sure that I was ok and if I had any questions. He answered all my questions and checked up on me frequently. Dr. Forman was very through with details and always responsive with our questions. We never felt rushed. He cared about our success.We were blessed to have Dr Forman as our Doctor. We went through very difficult times and he was always very optimistic while at the same time staying true to science based data to help us make decisions on his recommended treatment solutions. He was very kind and responsive to all the 100 questions or more that I would have. He really made the process much more bearable. I have been always impressed with how much he cared for me..he woukd always be alert to any emails I would have with questions. He never gave up on us. Other Doctors I'm sure would have taken us through the path of egg donor but he persisted and we tried many times until now I'm very happy pregnant 12 weeks with my own eggs and my husband sperm. He recommended all sorts of testing but always presenting us with very good science based rationale, which I loved because I never felt he was just trying any random thing. He really spent the time to think thoroughly the best course of treatment, sharing with me literature to understand better his recommendations.
I absolutely loved his appproach and really think all his patients are very lucky to have him as their Doctor. Even in the moments when we were close to give up, he gave us hope and helped us through the very painful and emotional process. 
We still have a long way to go to have a baby in our arms but I know now that Dr Forman was able to figure out what worked for us. We will for ever be grateful to him!!! I feel I'm  out of words to thank him..he shoumd feel very proud and happy to know he made our lives happier!!!Dr. Forman was very easy to talk to throughout our entire process. He was efficient and gave us all the possible outcomes that could happen regarding each step we took. He also was quick to followup with procedures to see how we were feeling.Dr Forman and his entire staff always treated us like humans- every step along the every way, every single detail was explained to us. Dr Forman went above and beyond. From our very first consult, he gave us his business card and told us not to hesitate to reach out via email or phone. Throughout our time at RMA, I emailed Dr Forman quite a bit, and he always got back to me literally within hours- even on the smallest detail. This was going above and beyond. He, not just our nurse, made sure we understood everything from start to finish. And he did it all with humility and care. Huge difference from our prior clinic- and I believe it is all because of Dr Forman- he not only has the skill, but he has the compassion...and during a process like IVF, that can be so stressful for the patient, he made all the difference! We were lucky to be chosen for the NexGen IVF study. While in that study I did feel like ""just a number"". I thought well this is THE Baby making factory and I assumed that's just the way this worked. Once our IVF Study cycle was complete and ended in miscarriage we took a year off to regroup (I recommend NOT taking so much time), however; we did need to just get our heads back in the game. We met back with Dr Drews to discuss our game plan moving forward. He is the most kind and caring Doctor I've ever met. Not only did he do my D&C after we lost the baby from the 1st IVF FET (I wasn't under his care any longer but my doc wouldn't help me), he also sat with us before we were ready to try again and just really made us feel like we could do this. The second IVF FET were with our NexGen Study embryos but was a completely different feeling. I wasn't in the study and I wasn't treated like a number. I was finally a human and it really made feel good about getting pregnant! (My little miracle IVF baby is now 3 months old!) Dr. Molinaro is very down to earth, personable, and caring. He shows a general interest of me as a human and now a mother and I never felt anything other than a friend with him. He was very honest when I needed him to be the most, yet caring in his way of delivering a message that could be hard to take. He was very accessible and i was never made to feel like I was a bother with my endless questions. I felt like I was treated more as a human than a number.  I was treated with compassion.  At first I was told what my treatment would be without enough explanation.  Once I pushed and showed that I wanted to be directly involved with my plan of care, Dr Ryback took the time to sit down with me and explain all of the pros, cons, and statistics regarding my treatment.  I felt a lot more confident about my plan of care after that.  Dr Eli Ryback is very compassionate and acknowledged that I was, in fact, human.I LOVED THE RESPONSE TIME AT THIS OFFICE.
THEY KNEW I WAS WAITING BY THE PHONE WAITING FOR RESULTS, AND THEY WERE VERY CARING AND ALWAYS CALLED ME ASAP. 
THE COMMUNICATION WAS EXCELLENT FOR A PRACTICE THE SIZE OF THEIRS, AND I TRULY APPRECIATED IT. She would call me to check-in, especially when things weren't going as planned.Dr. Forman has a wonderful bedside manner.   He understands that when a couple struggles with fertility issues it can be a upsetting and his positive upbeat attitude was very reassuring.  He took his time explaining each step of my fertility treatment and I never felt like a number. I didn't abuse it and write him often, but when I had a concern that I didn't want to discuss with my nurse, I would email Dr. Forman.  He always got back to me immediately, even on off hours or weekends and never made me feel like I was bothering him.Dr. Scott was simultaneously candid but also very warm when I first consulted with him in 2014, and the desk often tried to schedule my procedures with him if possible. After I became pregnant and suffered a late-term loss, I returned to his care in 2015, and he had changed. He seemed disinterested in continuing to see patients and exasperated with my placing demands on his time for scheduled follow-up consultations.Dr. Forman would answer all of our questions and concerns in a very timely matter and with very detailed responses.  He always took the time to check up on us and we felt he was always available and wanted us to succeed.  We unfortunately had a miscarriage from our first transfer (we were the 0.01% that PGD missed) and he was quite compassionate and caring during our loss.Despite his extremely demanding schedule, Dr. Forman went above and beyond in making me and my husband feel like he cared about our needs and concerns.  He was always honest and upfront about complications and/or issues that could arise.  Dr. Forman consistently answered our questions promptly and with the utmost patience.  He always explained procedures and results in a way that allowed us to have a good understanding.  We felt safe and confident under Dr. Forman's care and would highly recommend him to anyone in need of a reproductive endocrinologist.   Dr. Forman does a great job keeping in touch with his patients and he made sure our individual questions and concerns were always addressed quickly.From the first phone call to Dr. Forman's office I was treated with the utmost respect. I was called or emailed back almost immediately (and I mean Dr. Forman will answer emails within minutes of my sending them). I was always able to speak with my nurse or another nurse on call the same day I called and left a message. Amazing serviceActual time spent with doctor is very short. We are often rushed without much opportunity to ask questions, or are directed to ask our nurse. However, the short time we do spend with her she is very warm and understanding. Our nurse is fantastic.There were times I had an emotional breakdown and I felt she was able to connect. Also had conversations with my husband to make sure he was doing ok with handling my treatments.IVF NJ transitioned to RMA during our time with Dr. Jurema. In that time we had to change office locations. Our history and paperwork did not reach the new system in time resulting in a delay of cycle 1. After beginning cycle 1, we had limited interactions with Dr. Jurema by design of RMA. We dealt only with admin and nursing staff on a daily basis, and for procedures or checkups requiring a doctor we were given the doctor on staff at that time. After cycle 1 failed, we requested a meeting with Dr. Jurema in which we discussed options for cycle 2. After that meeting, again our access to him was restricted. In the middle of cycle 2 we were given wrong information by the doctor on staff resulting in another delay. When I requested to speak to Dr. Jurema about it I did not receive a call back for several days, and when I did he was short and cold saying that each doctor works with information they have in the moment and may not be fully versed in our case/history. We asked for more personalized care and communication, but it did not improve. Cycle 2 was also unsuccessful and when we left RMA we sent a detailed note explaining our reason for leaving was due to the impersonal nature of the facility.Explained everything in terms we understood
Never rushed us and was always available when we needed 
After a scare with the egg retrieval he made sure he came to do the implantation 
Dr. Doherty was always very open and honest with us.  We always felt like he was on our side. If we called the office with any concerns or questions , Dr. Doherty always returned our phone calls. He always had a way of calming our fears and wasting our painMy husband and I were always treated like a human.  Dr. Forman greeted us with our first names during every appointment with him.  He must have an exceptional memory ( the best docs do).  Because he would remember specific things and and then follow up on them during the next appointment.  We would chat during visits about things outside of my visit and he would remember details and events we spoke about.   At our last appointment he recalled everything from our first visit.  He called personally after my retrieval.  He still welcomes visits from me and my kids.Dr. Forman knew all details regarding my case. He would be always the one reviewing my results and recommending action plans, even when he was away from the office.Dr. Forman is an amazing doctor.  He explained every step of the process to us along the way.  He knew about my previous pregnancy issues (miscarriages and painful procedures) and was extremely gentle and understanding during every step.  Before I fully started the IVF treatment, I had a medical issue and Dr. Forman actually took the time out of his schedule to call and help me find a doctor who could treat me.  He genuinely cared if we conceived and gave me his professional opinion many times.  If it wasn't for Dr. Forman we would not have our beautiful daughter, who is now 6 months old.  I recommend him to everyone I know who is trying to conceive.Dr. Forman was always available to talk, and answer questions in a timely manner. He is companionate and went out of his way to be present for our egg retrieval and embryo transfer. He was always so warm and understanding. He took the time to actually talk to us, explain things and answer any questions we had. He always replied to calls/emails so quickly. He took the time to help understand and pick the best course of action to take in our journey. Whatever bump we had in the road, he felt it with us- the frustration and sadness... But was always so positive and knew we would have our baby. We will FOREVER be grateful to him and the staff at RMA because they enabled us to have our HEALTHY baby!Dr. Forman was a wonderful doctor.   I knew that he cared about me and my desire to be pregnant.  He called me and talked to me at length when an embryo that was transferred didn't make it once transferred.   When I went in for morning monitoring with a concern and he wasn't the doctor on call to do that but he was in the office,  he always came into my room to check me or to check on me.   He even did one of my retrievals when he wasn't scheduled to be on duty that day.   He always answered my questions and made me feel like he cared about me and never that I was asking too much or worrying too much.   I completely trusted him. He always took his time at each appointment to answer any questions I had. He was always friendly and very informative. Dr. Forman cares about his patients. He goes above and beyond for them. Just one of many examples would be taking the time to email me after my second retrieval while he was away with his family. He checked into the lab to look at our embryos and wanted me to know that they looked great and we would likely have many to PGD test. Never did I think I would hear anything until day 5, but that update just reminded me of what a wonderful Doctor Dr. Forman is. My list could go on and on in the time I spent working with Dr. Forman. multiple nurses, no coordinate of care, nurses frequently quit or were fired.  The reason we chose them was for the conception rate and to have continuity of care but when our dr was away, we couldn't cycle.  Also, cycles were cancelled to game their rates.  We lost about 12 months while various nurses messed up our cycles (no calls, no rx, no ability to get it) and enough money to be a really really nice car.Our meetings with Dr. Hong were very personalized.  It was clear that she cared about us as a couple and our desire to begin a family.  She tailored her conversations to use specifics about us and what we tried and what we were going to try.  I did not feel like she was giving us canned responses.  Dr. Hong took time on days she got to the clinic early to personally perform my morning monitoring (even when she wasn't the on call doctor that day).  On those days she was making a special effort to personally perform my ultrasound and see how my follicles were developing.  Her personal interest in our case was really touching.Dr. Kim is compassionate.  Our first transfer of two embryos resulting in a twin pregnancy, which I lost at 22 weeks.  When we went back to Dr. Kim to try again after our loss, he grieved with us and made us feel like we had a second chance.  And we did.  We did two back-to-back retrievals and the first embryo we transferred resulted in my now three year old son.She listened well and was very knowledgeable. She never acted like all our questions were bothering her. She even called me on her day off to give me critical advice during my cycle. Dr. Hong was very caring and always made me feel comfortable.Dr. Drews always took time to explain procedures and status with us personally. He was always caring and realistic. He treated all of my physical and emotional needs.Dr. Forman communicated with us, answered any and all questions/concerns we had, explained the process and our options thoroughly, and was overall very thoughtful and caring in our conversations during each step.Dr. Kim truly understood what my husband and I were going through. Him and his wife also dealt with infertility. Their infertility issues was the reason he switched to reproductive medicine. He always made me feel comfortable and confident which is what you need when you’re in a cycle. You don’t need to be discouraged. He also went out of his way to go my transfer when we wasn’t the doctor on call that day. I recommended him to so many of my friends and those who used him all have their babies now. Dr. Treiser took the time to actually sit and talk with me, and explained the process. She answered every question I had and was not intimidating to approach. She was very candid and honest. She was always willing to listen. Infertility is a challenging diagnosis with a lot of emotions. Dr. Treiser was sad with me when things didn't go as planned and shared in my joy when I was pregnant finally. Initially, I was having twins, but lost one around 8 weeks. She was comforting and gentle and definitely went above and beyond to support me. She always took time to go over treatment and results with me. She even did a lot of my monitoring.I was very much treated like a human by Dr. Forman, and we have remained in touch to this day. He was very interested in my unique fertility story, and I never felt like I had to remind him about who I was or my particular situation. He went ABOVE AND BEYOND every step of the way, and made me feel very well care for. The day of my transfer was the Monday of Memorial Day weekend, and even though he wasn't working or on call, he came in to personally do my transfer. I also emailed the nurse once I had the baby and stopped by the hospital once I had her to meet the baby. He is a very special man and I will always be grateful for the gift that he gave me.Dr. Ryback spent time meeting with my husband and I when we we first started this journey.  He was prepared for our meeting and discussed our options.  Throughout my treatment he would have conference calls with us to review failed cycles and talk about next steps.  I truly felt that he cared about me and my dreams to have a family.  I even introduced him to my son that he helped create and he picked him and hugged him and was truly so happy for me.  I could tell he was eager and hard working. I knew he wanted to get results. I felt like a number not a human because the place felt like a your lining up in a factory. The clinics has no windows, its gloomy and people are not friendly there. I did not feel comfortable at all. Everytime we want to speak with our doctor, they will book us by time and date and then we have to pay $300 for 15 minutes of her time. Its ridiculous!!!Richard Scott is incredibly knowledgeable, and always took to the time to explain everything to me. He clearly cares both about his patients and about their success. Dr. Shastri called me even if she did not do the retrieval or transfer. She also called me to explain what it meant when on day 5 my embryos looked like morulas and we were going to wait another day for blastocysts. I was always in the know and treated like a patner in my plan.She's very friendly, she make sure i understand what's going on with my body and when am concern or feeling uneasy, she just pickups the phone and call meWhen I was able to speak with the doctor she was wonderful but I think due to practice size there would be long periods of time without feedback from her. It's a busy clinic, so you expect to be a bit rushed. Dr. Doherty wasn't always totally clear on his explanations, but he did seem to be up to date on our case.Dr Bergh is kind but he definitely leaves the details of your steps to his assistants and nurses. Dr. Rybak reviews all details on my medical record. I was monitoring my cycle from Cleveland Ohio, he was personally calling me on the phone when it is necessary! He did my ultrasound twice by himself during monitoring! Unfortunately I had my five fertilized eggs not achieved the blastocyst, Dr. Rybak was there to answer all my questions. Dr. Kaser really surprised me. His bedside manner is wonderful. I never felt like a number, but always a human being, whom he truly cared about. His balance of sensitivity and intelligence is unlike I've ever seen. He's a very special doctor and has given me the confidence to give this a try, despite being considered 'too old' according to other doctors I have previously consulted with.Dr Shastri was one of the most empathetic doctors I have ever had. I was a very complicated case, and she would work hard to make sure all angles were being explored to ensure I received the best care. Dr. Werner seemed really caring. She read me very well that i needed more information. From every appointment forward she was very informative. Dr Costantini always took the time to answer my questions. She would spend ample time on the phone with my husband and I for questions and always spent time with us during our ultrasounds. She would come in early to see me specifically for special days and procedures. Dr. Rybak is always patient and attentive. Dr.Ryback has really made us feel comfortable and has been thorough since we switched practices.He checked in all frequently, spoke to me to ensure I understood, and made me feel comfortable when feeling nervous or anxious.In a 7 month span we saw Dr Treiser 3 times. This process isn’t personable it’s all about staying on task and doing what they suggest even if it cost thousands of dollars Found Dr. Kaser to be extremely involved with my case.  When things weren’t going well he stopped all other clinicians from doing any testing and did it all himself even if it meant him coming to work at 6am just to see me.  I found him to be genuinely disappointed when I was and really felt my pain through the process.When I was with him in the office or on the phone it felt like he genuinely cared about my well being.We met with Dr. Kaser after a failed IVF with another RMA clinic. He was warm and friendly, but matter-of-fact and really detail oriented. He is incredibly professional and (while I'm not a doctor) really seems very competent. He was balanced in his assessment and reviewed all possible options with us. We really liked him immediately and felt very comfortable. My first transfer resulted in a blighted ovum and I felt that my questions as to why this happened were brushed aside as unexplainable and I got the sense that I was being a nuisance. After a come to Jesus moment with my doctor, the care I received after my second loss was much more supportive and informative. I felt like Dr. Franasiak was with me from the beginning until the end, even when I had bleeding early on in the pregnancy. I felt like he explained things to me and was there for me even after hours.He was always personable with me and my husband. He spoke to both of us gently but conveyed the information professionally.  He truly acts like a partner with us in helping us build our family. From day one, Dr. Rauch showed how much she cared about me and the experience my husband and I were going through.  Dr. Rauch acknowledged that the road we had been on prior to coming to see her was challenging and emotional.   I felt validated and heard during each step of the process.  Dr. Rauch was always there to answer my questions, address any concerns I had with the process and also instill hope that the end result of getting pregnant was going to happen.  I was not a typical fertility patient: I had lots of eggs (but not great quality), a thick lining, and I got pregnant very easily (but I had early miscarriages). Dr. Bergh treated me with personalized, outside the box care. As did my nurse.Dr. Drews is amazing. He's warm, funny but also extremely knowledgeable and will spend as much time as you need to answer all your questions.The entire staff at RMANJ are kind and knowledgeable. They go out of their  way to explain things and make themselves available. She was very caring with the whole process.He remembered the details of my case (divorced, freezing eggs, low AMH, specifics about my work). When we had zero fertilized after an ER- he called and spoke to both of us and cleared his schedule to see us in person. He helped us arrange to pay for the cycle so we could save our insurance for later. He answered questions I had about medical studies and elaborated on items I couldn't quite understand. If I am not comfortable with something, he explains it right away and he adjusts his protocol based on my concerns. Dr. Ryback is very special!! After my first devastating and unexpected failed cycle, he called me just to check in to see how I'm holding up.  Although most doctors would hopefully do this, Dr. Rybak called me on a Friday afternoon from home 1/2 before the Sabbath was about to begin.  He genuinely cares about each one of his patients!Dr. C is so incredibly compassionate. She was key in my healing from my second tri termination ( due to untested embryo from 2008) She held me, cried with me and encouraged me to keep going. She is truly one of a kind. always very kind, but gave information readily. my questions and concerns were always handles with dignity and respectDr Forman always took the time to respond to my emails so quickly even on nights and weekends. He knew how nerve racking the process was and always did his best to communicate with me as often as possible.Dr. M is super thorough and explains everything in simple terms. He never makes me feel like he is rushing to do other things, even though he is extremely busy. He also is compassionate and has a great demeanor. Dr. Forman was always very honest and cautios setting expectations but he never gave up on our case.and always proposed different alternatives of treatment during the many times we tried.Dr. Forman answered every question in the detail I needed, whether it was in person, through e mail or even a phone call outside of regular clinic hours.  Becuase we hit some unexpected bumps along the way in regards to findings, things took a little longer than I was thinking.  Dr. Forman was supportive every step of the way.I only saw Dr. Forman for consultation in the beginning of the process. After the initial meetings I only dealt with other staff members. RMA is like a factory but they get the job done.I was concerned that I would feel like a number and not a human because RMA is such a large clinic with many locations and patients.
But I never felt that way. I was treated very well. I never felt like a number. RMA is such a large organization that you don't necessarily see your primary doctor all that often. The nurse who was in charge of my contact was quite cold and unfriendly. That is really what kept Dr. Hock from getting full grades. She was professional, but she was very pessimistic anything would work for me. I loved my care team. They were amazing. One thing that really resonated with me was the first time we went to meet with Dr. Rybak, the clinics computer system was down, and Dr. Rybak printed our charts, read through them at lenght, and had spent over and hour making notes BEFORE we arrived. I didn't even have to say, ""How would you address our case differently"" because that was one of the first things to come out of his mouth. She was very motherly & understood our need for a baby & our situation. She was extremely positive that we would get pregnant fast with her help & expertise.Dr. Treiser is very professional, but clearly wants the best for her patients.  She was blunt, but caring at the same time.  This is clearly her field of expertise, but she still tried to connect with us on a personal level during our visits.  Since the birth of my children, she has personally reached out to me to check in.She seemed to listen. Paid attention to my requests. Dr. Rauch is the best!! She is so caring and concerned with each patient!!! Thank you for you help along this journey!!!! We love you!!!He was so thorough and in constant contact with me. When I had a miscarriage under his care he was so amazing and did everything he could to get answers and fix it for next time. Dr. Jurema is very calm and caring. I only wish I had more access to him.Dr. M had empathy and understanding for our situation.  He we warm, enthusiastic, and really wanted us to be successful.Dr Shastri was caring, thoughtful, and made you feel important. She was invested in my success. Dr. Goodman was incredibly warm and supportive throughout the process. She patiently answered every single one of my questions and made me feel like I was not alone.She always made me feel comfortable. Gave me all information and was positive along the way. Dr Constantini was extremely warm, empathic, and took her time with me in our consultation. She explained the answers to my questions and had an excellent bedside manner. We came back to RMA to pursue the possibility of donor egg.  Going over our history with doctor Hong, she was kind and sympathetic and put a plan in place for us.Dr. Rauch is an excellent doctor who is brilliant and compassionate. She truly cares about her patients and listens to any and all questions and works with you.She took the time to explain things and was very empathetic Dr. Rybak was very understanding and sweet and nice and understood what I wanted and never forced me to do anything I did not want to do. the Dr. eli ryback  was very professional warm nice explaining the best with out a doubt the nurse   a Little Les but was also very professional  explaining  more pressured in time the more we wand down in the rank the less we felt because you were you were more like a number more pressured in time to much pt. but overall they were very nice professionalI conceived naturally and Dr. Doherty called me himself to congratulate me. When that pregnancy ended in a miscarriage he also called me himself to offer support and reassurance. I never feel pressured to do any treatment. I feel that he gives me all the facts and allows me to make my own decision.She is very caring and explains things to you in detail. I had to have a D&C and she made sure she performed the procedure. She cheers on her patients and supports you through this roller coaster.Dr Forman was always so responsive and he went above and beyond to make sure I received the best care. He would call or email me to answer my questions. He was always reachable and took the time to listen to all my concerns. He definitely cared about me and my success. He always returned my phone calls and emails and was available for in person questions.Called me personally and directly. She had all details of my age, my genetics, history and where I am.
Took the time at all meetings to explaining all details of process and answer questions in relation to my situation.We came from overseas to be treated by doctor Forman. Everything was new for us, yet Dr. Forman made us feel so looked after. He treated us as if we were the only patients he has. He told us we can email him with whatever question we had, and every email was answered within a very short time. All this has helped us to stay calm because we felt so looked after in the best way possible!Of the doctors and nurses my husband and I worked with during this very difficult period, Dr. Forman was the most considerate and compassionate physician we had the pleasure of working with. He was always available to answer all questions and was very caring. He called me on a Sunday when I found out we only had one viable embryo. He understands the emotional pain infertility causes and is there to listen to you cry but still keeps you hopeful.The doctor took the time to get to know me and my situation. She patiently answered a million questions all along the way. She was always very clear with me about my chances of a pregnancy using my own eggs while also being very kind and caring. I feel very lucky to have found her. Although I dealt mostly with nurses and technicians, I knew Dr. Molinaro was handling my case, and never at any time did I feel like my treatment was unimportant or ""standard."" My treatment plan felt personalized to my circumstances, and he was always available for questions. I felt the treatment was more tailored to me as a person than just giving me the same plan that she gives to all her patients. Dr. Treiser was professional, warm, and direct. She explained everything clearly, and encouraged us to contact her for any reason. The staff at the clinic backed her up successfully. honest about the processDr. Molinaro always took his time with my husband and I. If we had questions during our appointment, he would let us ask all the questions we needed to ask in order to make sure we understood everything that was going to happen. She always listens to my concerns and suggestions She called me numerous times to discuss concerns. I was assigned a nurse to work with directly with Dr. Yih and together they answered all of my questions.He is amazing, truly the most kind, compassionate, personal doctor I’ve ever met. I never once felt like a number.Dr. Shastri took the time to sit with me to fully understand my treatment. She has called me regularly to check in on my status and is well-versed in my progress and tests prior to my transfer to her.Dr Bergh was always available for my numerous questions. He is extremely knowledgeable and very personable. Dr. Treiser is a very caring, involved doctor. Dr Doherty is amazing!  He called me when I needed questions answered.  I was able to email him whenever I needed him and always received a response.  Dr D. knew my situation very well and always treated me with respect.  She was nice, to the point. Bedside manner OK. Very professional Dr. Forman is thoughtful, thorough, compassionate and accessible.  He gives detailed attention to the patient's history and takes the time to discuss various treatment alternatives.  She welcomed me with a smile during the 5am monitoring cycle and would call me personally at home during the cycle to check in. He took the time to know us, he is a Rabbi my husband is a pastor and I am a devout Catholic. He makes religion part of our discussion because he knows it is important to us. Dr Bergh went out of his way to explain everything to me. He knew I was well versed in fertility treatments and seemed to value my experience .He took his time to explain and gave realistic expectations. She was very caring, honest, and compassionate towards our situation! I felt as though I knew her for longer then we actually did I loved my care team. I did not have the result I wanted,  a live birth, but never did I feel like a number or a bother when I had questions. I would recommend them to anyone. My nurse was always available and responded in a timely fashion, always the same day.Dr Hong is great and time spent in person or on phone with her is valuable. Unfortunately, RMA of NJ is like a factory - packed waiting rooms, long wait times, huge layer of nurses you have to get through. When doing inseminations or transfers, feels like you see a different doctor every time. I never felt like a number. Dr. Molinaro always took his time with me and was always available for questions. I get they really cared and hoped for a positive pregnancy test just as much as I did. They explained everything perfectly so that I could understand while still not talking down to me. When he saw my insurance wouldn't cover anything, Dr. Molinaro referred me to a study that I could participate in which covered 90% of the cost. We will be eternally grateful to Dr. Molinaro and the RMA team. Dr Bergh made me so comfortable, he treated me like an individual, answered all my questions.   He went above and beyond to help my husband and I have a baby For every cycle there is an improvement and doctor clearly explained the procedures before every treatment.
Doctor promptly replies to every question in email.
Takes very good care. Couldn't ask for a better doctor .we felt very comfortable with the doctor.Everyone was kind & explained everything alwaysOur discussions were thorough. Dr Drews took the time to ensure all of my questions and concerns were addressed. Very busy office... you do not see the same doctor every time you goNurse and the staff were very helpfulHe will go out of his way to make sure he returns my calls & answers all of my questions - even if theyre insane! Good balance of care and fact
He treated me with respect and consideration He and his staff were always available to me and willing to answer my questions.  They didn't make me feel inferior or dumb for not knowing details or what certain things meant.Very personable, knew information about my history prior to being a patientDr Forman took the time to review my history and discuss it with me thoroughly before beginning my treatment. He valued my opinion and took it into consideration when we decided which path to take. He remembered me when I was in his office and made me feel very comfortable. Always compassionate and explained details
They were extremely compassionate and took the time to explain everything with patience and in detail. They never made me feel rushed and at times even allowed me to call my nurse on her personal cell phone after hours when I had a crisiswhen Dr Trieser owned IVFNJ the entire staff were personable and nice. You felt they were routing for you.Blood work and ultrasound are on a first come first serve basis and it is whoever is working the day you come in is the MD who will be performing ultrasound.Michael Bohrer and Christine Rose (my nurse) knew me, remembered me, were patient with me, and always kind and upbeat. I had the best experience with Dr rybak and rma. My calls were always returned in a timely matter. Dr rybak called me himself if there was ever a change in procedure or to deliver important news and was able to diagnose me within 10 minutes only meeting me I felt that Dr Drews lectured me about my prognosis for quite a long time, and did not give me much chance to ask questions, nor did he want to understand our approach to family planning. He would dismiss my questions and push us towards donor eggs (presumably to keep RMA's success % high).I got the sense that yes she deals with patients and these issues day in and day out but I took it as a comfort with her she that she is knowledgeable and experienced and was applying that skill to my care. She always took the time to explain things in detail, to remember particulars about my care, and to share words of encouragement. She seemed calm and happy, well adjusted, and patient. Didn't see or hear from my doctor as much as I thought I would Have Or as much as I expected. first retrieval I was surprised he wasnt doing and second I knew from 1st time he wasnt but was kind of disappointed. I know he was always reviewing my blood work and u/s and made the decisions on my treatment but didn't feel at all a personal connection.Dr. Molinaro listened to our concerns, followed up, and made adjustments when needed to stack the deck and give me my best chance of a viable pregnancy. Dr.Gulati took her time to do a full assessment and diagnostic work up prior to egg transfer to figure out why I had previous failed embryo transfers. She explained every step of the way in detail, listened to my questions and patiently answered with no judgment or reservation while still stating objective. Dr. Scott is patient, caring, thorough, and kind.  He always spends adequate time with us and answers all questions.I can be high maintenance at times. I like to know all the details of what’s going on. Never once did I feel like I was being “too much.” Whenever I have additional questions that my nurse can’t answer she always calls to answer them. We have had an extremely difficult road and she has always been kind and empathetic towards us. Always available to talk. Has called me with good news and bad news herself. Always kind He explained everything really well and answered all my questions or slowed down and explain differently when he could tell I was confused. He left the decisions to us with 0 pressure to immediately jump into IVFDr. Franasiak took the time to meet with me every time I had a question and answered all my questions honestly and scientifically. She is very caring and helped me through my miscarriage Dr. Kaiser had the best bedside manner of any physician i have ever dealt with.  He always took time to answer all my questions. I never felt rushed or disregarded.Doctor Maria is very positive and that's one of the aspect that encourages me and make me feel like a human and also she has compassion. He is very caring and sincerely wants to help. He is passionate and emotionally invested in his patients. Under the care of Dr. Fischer, I felt like I was the only patient she was treating, even though I new I was not. It felt like we developed a friendship during the treatment because of her incredible bedside manner. Dr. Fischer is kind, acknowledged and explain the process over and over again if needed. She was always calling and checking on us to see if we were okay. Dr. Fischer is by far the most caring doctor I've ever had.Dr. Fischer was so kind and knowledgeable about the entire process. She encouraged me and gave me hope that this would work for me and helped me feel that I was not “broken”.Dr. M was always available to talk to. After a miscarriage he immediately called me to talk. During the IVF process he was very understanding and supportive. Overall he had a calming presence and a positive attitude. I had a great experience with him. Dr. Fischer never pushed us towards a treatment and constantly reminded us that it was our decision to make. She provided all possible scenarios, treatment options, and gave her best advice and medical opinion each step of the way.My treatment plan lasted longer than the average person, so I got to know Dr. Molinaro well over time. Dr. Werner was always kind, never acted rushed, was willing to talk in person or over the phone. Understood where I was in my life, and that a break from treatment was necessary and okay. Dr. Treiser was familiar with my history and addressed my problems personally. I felt as though I was understood and being cared for.She is extremely compassionate and shows that she cares very much. She wants the best results for my husband and I. I felt that the doctors, nurses and staff at RMA were all very familiar with my personal needs, desires and medical status.  I also felt that all of the above would jump through hoops to accommodate any necessary changes or adjustments to my treatment.She was very caring and made me feel like she really wanted to help us in anyway possible I liked that at RMA you had staff assigned to you (nurse, financial advisor). I always knew who to.call.wirh questions which were answered timely and thoroughly.She’s a great listener, compassionate, patient and thorough ",9.10000000000001,9.10000000000001,"In addition to highly specific diagnosis and treatment program that Dr. Franasiak provided, he was realistic about what the outcomes could be at every stage, and was incredibly kind during every interaction. He made me feel so comfortable with everything and gave me a sense of confidence that everything was going to work out well. He reviews all my records prior to meeting with me and always shows up prepared. He was also very realistic - yet very tactful when setting expectations. I am high risk because of my age and medicine I am on so he referred me to a MFM doctor who he personally worked with to help with the process. She always insisted that we give her a call whenever we had any questions. I started out with another doctor (who since retired) and worked with her moving forward. So if you are looking for someone who will try the kitchen sink method, she is not for you. He was encouraging and caring and really made me feel special - not like just another patient. Dr. Forman listening to my goals and guided us in the best possible way to help us now and in the long term. I had more testing that should have been done, to realize it was a waste of $28K. I asked Dr. Jurema if there were more tests we could do after my 3rd miscarriage, and he recommended we do another cycle and just pay for the new advanced testing. Forman is very knowledgeable, patient and detail oriented. He is extremely compassionate and dedicated to his work. One thing that really stood out to me was when we had requested an update about our Day 3 embryos (we were waiting to have CCS done on Day 6 and wanted an update to see how many were still alive), the nurse who was supposed to call us was out that day unexpectedly, and so Dr. Forman emailed me personally that evening to give me an update on the embryos. As my doctor, he never made me feel like a number. For example, today I'm pregnant because he recommended this study from a clinic in Spain where they seem to have really solved the endometrian factor..to me it definitely makes sense that not every woman is the same and he recommended a test to determine how receptive and when my uterine linen would be more likely to have an embryo implanted..he recommended this after 2 failed transfers with normal PGD tested embryos, which was very disappointing. I was sad to leave him and RMANJ when we were told that all looked good at 10 weeks when we moved to an ob/gyn. At that time the facility was IVF NJ and at the beginning of our cycle I had one appointment at Dr. Jurema's office where I saw him and discussed day-to-day actions. Dr. Forman was always calm, explained things clearly and both my husband and I understood the process and all the different steps - it's very involved. He was recommended by a friend of mine who works in the genetics field and she expressed the opinion that Dr. Forman is one of the best upcoming IVF doctors in the tri-state area and that RMA NJ have the best IVF labs (labs play a key role in the IVF treatment and they should be taken in consideration when selecting your doctor). We feel blessed that our path led us into Dr. Forman's hands. Dr. Drews answered any questions we had and was always available. Dr. Werner is very compassionate while also being direct and understanding. She was very supportive along the whole process. Dr. Forman is extremely knowledgeable and thorough and I always felt that my treatment was in the best hands. I also referred my best friend to Dr. Forman and she had success with him in the first cycle. Whenever I had questions, he took the time to explain to me in details in person or via email. Forman was great, he took his time to explain my condition and create a plan just for me. He explained everything and let us know what the risks and expectations were realistically. I always felt better after an appointment with him, understanding what was in the future and with all the information I needed to make a decision for my family. I always felt like I was in great care and that my outcome was important to him. But I remember my experience with Dr Drews was very positive. He is very knowledgeable and professional. We first went to our consult with Dr. Thomas Molinaro and he wanted to know everything in our past, he explained EVERYTHING,  and made me feel so much more comfortable with the treatments we were about to undergo. He was also very realistic and tactful when setting expectations. Out of all the doctors I've worked with at four different clinics Dr. Molinaro is the only one that provided his direct email address and was reachable by phone without having to go through many people. I was able to put my trust in Dr. Molinaro which was a relief after the experiences I had with doctors at other clinics. Rybak always made it a point to make sure I was comfortable. While I only had a few appointments in which I formally sat down to speak with Dr. Jurema, it was always clear he had carefully reviewed my files and was familiar with the details of my diagnosis and care. Dr. Forman was readily available to answer all of my questions and he kept checking-up on me to ensure I was feeling well. Dr. Forman showed incredible patience with the millions of questions we had every step of the way. Dr. Forman greeted us with our first names during every appointment with him. I get they really cared and hoped for a positive pregnancy test just as much as I did. He would dismiss my questions and push us towards donor eggs (presumably to keep RMA's success % high).I got the sense that yes she deals with patients and these issues day in and day out but I took it as a comfort with her she that she is knowledgeable and experienced and was applying that skill to my care. She was very caring and made me feel like she really wanted to help us in anyway possible I liked that at RMA you had staff assigned to you (nurse, financial advisor)."
57,RMA of New Jersey,advice,"Start with Dr. Franasiak and RMA Marlton and don't waste your time going anywhere else. Don’t be afraid to ask questions about treatment options and possible scenarios. You will be heard. She will respond to emails. Don’t hesitate to reach out.Be prepared for your consultation and ask a lot of questions, Dr. Werner will be very patient to answer them all.We really don't have anything to recommend other than schedule an appointment and go meet her! (and ask to have Jen as your nurse)RUN Challenge her. Do your research and be your own advocate. Ask her for different treatment options and her opinion on them. She won't think outside the box for your care so you have to seek it yourself and maybe she will agree on your thoughts and implement it. Set appointments and have her speak with you. Schedule the time otherwise she will be in a rush to get off the phone. I can't stress enough to ask questions and be your own advocate for creative care and testing otherwise you will fall into a protocol bucket and be successful or not.Don’t expect Dr Shefali Shastri to perform all of your IUIs or monitoring. Be prepared to receive treatment from other doctors. Research and be your own advocate.At first she can seem blunt about the success rate, but she will do everything she can to get you a baby Do your research and go to your consultation with questions. She will take the time to answer all of them and not make you feel rushed. Trust the process. Just trust her. She knows what she’s doing. Come prepared with your questions, and what you want out your appointment. She can hold your hand, but you’ll get more out of her time and expertise if you come to the table with expectations and questions.Do your research ask questions.They are quick to recommend donor eggs. I think it is because they want to help you have success, but it’s then very daunting to look into the egg donor process. So much more complicated than IVF with your own eggs. 
Ask him any questions you have. He will give you a compassionate and honest answer. Make sure you ask her to outline every possible option for you. She explained all the procedures to me at length. Educate yourself too, while Dr Kaser will answer your questions, make sure you know all of your questions. Ask any question you have because he’s willing to answer even the most mundane ones so take advantage of his knowledge. Dr. Franasiak was extremely knowledgable about infertility and the procedures and treatments of same. Although it was initially difficult for me to remain calm during the treatment cycle, I quickly learned how educated he is and that I needed to put my full trust in him. He is very smart and was aware of our case in great detail. Let the doctors do their job, and in doing so it is (or was for us) easier to remain more calm throughout the treatment cycle.You will not regret it. I was so nervous before hand and once we sat with him it all went away. Arrive with questions and a notebook. He will advise you of what notes to take from your consultation so you can remember everything from your visit. Ask all your questions - Dr. Molinaro knows it all and don't be afraid to ask about alternative options and what he's seen be successful/unsuccessful. 

He's looking at understanding the full picture here of your story so that you can have a good outlook.Don't see him if you want someone to hold your hand, he will just tell you how it is and keep going.  Do you research because Dr Kaser is a professional who wants his patients to be at the table making decisions with him.   Come prepared with questions, he is very patient and will answer all your questions. Don’t be afraid to ask questions! Ask as many questions as you can think of and write them down as prep for meeting with the doctor.Have questions you would like to ask written down in advance. Don't be afraid to ask questions and make sure you understand the process and what to expect. Dr. Fischer is more than happy to answer all of your questions. You can trust he will do his best to help you. He is very approachable and will take the time to discuss options and answer questions. That you may not see your doctor very frequently, particularly when it comes to the mundane frequent monitoring. Trust her. She is very smart and knows what she is doing. When she tells you ""it'll be ok"" believe me, it will. Be prepared for her to speak very quickly and give you a lot of information. Bring a notepad and write things down since there is too much to remember at once. If she (or anyone else) recommends surgery, get a second opinion to be sure.He will help you and make it work! It takes time and patience as a patient. Dr. Molinaro is extremely knowledgeable about the field.  Don’t ever hesitate to ask any question no matter how crazy you think it may sound. He will be able to give you a research based thorough answer that will leave you with the knowledge to make you decision.  Never hesitate to reach out to him.  He will always find time to get back to you and his responses show the time and care he takes in his role as your doctor.  Absolutely request to see Dr. Hong if you want a mix of warmth, knowledge, and accessibility. Call early and follow up more frequently.  You have to be proactive if you want to see him or hear from him.She is very educated and informative but doesn't always have a lot of compassion so do not take it personally. Also, dont be afraid to advocate for yourself and things you may want explored further. Positive attitude and compassionate care go a long way to making you feel comfortable so if they are what you are looking for Dr. Juerma will be a good doctor for you.  His protocols, however, were to maximize number of eggs retrieved without much of a focus on quality.To make sure they know how many injections they will have to take and how many office visits they will have to go to per cycle.  Find out how much out of pocket costs they will have to pay for upfront.Not to feel shy to ask questions.  Dr. Werner will always give you her full attention and she wants to make sure her patients are informed.  He is a great doctor and very knowledgeable and you will be in good hands.Research and ask question. Ask why she is choosing some drugs over others.Ask as many questions as you have until you are comfortable and fully understand your course of treatment. You will be well taken care of. Rely on her and her staff they are great and don’t loose hope! You are so fortunate to be working with such a fantastic doctor.If you don’t mind straight forward advice and no fluff - yes. She’s smart and to the point.  You need to understand what type of doctor you need prior to joining RMA.  If you need more emotional support Dr. Cosantini may be a better fit, and she’s in the same location.Trust him but ask questions. He'll patiently answer them and put you at ease. Come in with an open mind and any question you may have  he will more than willing to answer and work with it Write down all questions before you arrive so you can leave the consultation with a good understanding of what will take place next. Be open, honest and don't be nervous. You are in the BEST hands.We did not see him often during treatment, but he is just a phone call away. Trust the process. And remember that each step is tailored to the individual patient. Dr. Morris is smart, professional and compassionate, and will do what's best for your process. Ask a lot of questions! Dr. Morris is great and will answer all of them! sometimes even with a diagram. She is an amazing doctor and you are lucky to have her on your sideGet ready to travel to Freehold and Eatontown. He does initial appointments in Freehodl but doesn’t do follow ups there. I would advise a friend to put all their trust into Dr. Hong, as she is truly competent and skilled.Go for it!  She was absolutely wonderful during this process.  Request that he be the doctor doing the embryo transfer if you get to that point.If you want a knowledgeable, caring, and someone with an amazing bedside manner than Dr. Rybak is the best choice for you!She is a very fast talker, so if you dont understand something, speak up! Never hesitate to ask her questions or reach out, she really wants to help you.Always stay optimistic even if she says there is little hope.  Where this is life there is always hope.  Ask a lot of questions and don't stop until you get the complete answer to your question even if it is not the answer you want to hear.Don't hesitate to reach out to him after an appointment if you have additional questions he is great at getting back to patients.Choose her! She has been doing this for so many years and has great experience!Make sure you take an escribe role as a patient and do your research.  There may be some questions that you need to raise that the doctor may not raise Stick with it! Don’t give up with negative pregnancy tests or losses. She and the entire practice will be with you to the end.ask all of your questions. She talks fast, so be ready to listen carefully and ask for things to be repeated if you need. Dr rybak is there for you and not only his pay check. He really gives you the time you need to make sure you understand your treatment. He will spend time in office on the phone and really come up with the best plan of action Ask to speak with her if the nurses give you a hard time. She will almost always make time within a few hours. If you want someone who will try every theoretical/ aggressive  approach and not something well proven, choose a different physician. She is so kind though and may be better with someone who needs a lot of hand holding.Ask lots of questions.  He is a good listener and does an excellent job explaining things in lay terms.Come prepared with your questions. Ask for all prospective outcomes even if you CCS test an embryo know that it doesn’t guarantee a pregnancy and won’t aid against a miscarriage.Come prepared to each of your appointments with all of your questions, so you can ask her at once.To trust him and not give up if treatment takes longer than expected.Trust what he is doing and never be afraid to ask questions. Be aware that there is a lot of waiting involved in the process. Not like in the waiting room, but to make appointment, get a schedule, etc. if pursuing IVF.Be honest about your goals and expectations. Let him know how much or how little information you need. Make sure you share all your concerns and do not be afraid to ask dr Rybak to repeat anything He is very thorough explaining everything, but it is still good to come up with your own questions ahead of time. The first consult she will not only explain everything to you she willl draw and write it down for you.  She will tell you the good and bad   Be open - things may not always happen exactly as and when you expect, but Dr. Doherty and the RMA team never quits!Dr. Treiser can seem a bit quiet at times but if you ask her all your questions and concerns, she will be very kind and talk to you about everything.Don't be afraid to ask questions and write things downHe does tell you what his honest opinion is about your diagnosis and I value that. However I could see patients having a hard time with him if they wanted to go on a wing and a prayer and try with their own eggs with a very likely unsuccesful outcome.Keep doing your amazing work and creating life with science by your side :)Let him know what questions and concerns you have. He is always happy to respond and provide more info.Always stand your ground and be vocal about what you want. Never hesitate to ask Dr. Doherty for advice. He will take care of you. Do not hesitate to express any concerns or hesitations - she will be honest with you and give you the best recommendation based on a personalized plan.  Don't hold back saying something you think may sound silly - it's all important - this is your family!Discuss other options for changing medication dosages, triggering earlier, transferring 3 day fresh embryos or not PGD testing.  It seems he has a set protocol per patient and doesn’t seem to veer from it.She isn’t the warmest doctor at RMA but she does care, and she is extremely knowledgeable. Be honest about what you need from her and she will do her best to meet those needs and make your process easier. Ask her as many questions as you need to!  She will definitely respond thoroughly.Always ask if you have questions. He will answer.You're incredibly lucky!  Bring a notebook to write things down or come with questions because you're going to be given a lot of information to process.  Trust that you're in great hands by being under his care.Make sure like with any appointment for any treatment to have a list of questions you may have. There really isn't anything to be ready for with her. She really explains things thoroughly and is willing to go over things in more depth if you don't understand.Bring a notebook! You won't remember everything and having notes to look back on is helpful. Dr. Forman is all about patient education...imagine a really thorough high school health class mixed with an advanced college level biology class. That's your new patient appointment in a nutshell!Request that he perform all your procedures and have your RN assist with coordinating your schedule and his so that can occur barring weather or emergency scheduling changes.  His calming bedside manner and confidence will put you at ease for all procedures.  Be prepared for the fact that you will not always see him during monitoring or for procedures, but trust that you are still in caring hands and that he will be following your treatment.  Be prepared to receive a lot of information if you seek it.His calm and optimistic demeanor will get you through the good and the bad. Trust him!Don't be afraid to ask questions and make sure you have time to discuss her answers. Dr. Hock will go over all of your questions in detail.Ask all the questions!  She is a wealth of information, but she can also explain things in a clear, concise, need-to-know basis.  She will tell you as much or as little as you care to know about every step of the way.He is the best!  I felt so comfortable and understood so much after 1 visit with him.  To trust that he is personally reviewing each and every one of your scans and would treats each patient as if it was his own daughter.  You can feel it.  Do not be afraid to ask questions! Dr. Shastri wants you to fully understand what is happening every step of the way. She is always there to answer any questions that you may have.You should know that once you begin the process of IVF you don't see your actual doctor very much.  Feel free to ask questions - he is very receptive to that and it will help him know what information you need.  He will try to work within the parameters of your insurance, but if you are ready to be more aggressive despite the cost, let him know.  I'm certain that if money were no object in my treatment, we would have made the jump to IVF already, but since that has been a huge financial stumbling block, he has been willing to let us do more IUIs than most.Just do it. You won't regret calling and making the appointment to see Dr. Hong!Don't be afraid to ask questions, and trust your gut. Unless you go to the Springfield office regularly, it's possible you may only see her at your scheduled consultations, rather than at monitoring, IUI, etc.Whenever you have concern about your procedures or during early pregnancy, always email Dr. Forman, he will address your concern right away. I see many patients resort to facebook or forum, but they are only getting another person's experience, every body is different, trust your doctor, not facebook or forum. And be very alert and cautious in case any issue comes up. Trust him!Be open minded and trust that he knows what he is doing. Dr. Forman can be quiet and almost shy in appearance but he is extremely knowledgeable.I would see her more often if I was in the Basking Ridge office, but I have been frequenting the Somerset as it's in close proximity to my home. Always ask questions and understand the process. I think I think as a patient you have to take into consideration your personality and when interviewing prospective doctors consider how their bedside manner will work as either a pro or con for youI have recommended Dr. Forman to a number of my friends and they have all gone on to become parents. My biggest piece of advice would be to not wait. Make an appointment as soon as you think something may be wrong.Always have an open mind. Dr. Foreman will do everything possible for you to get the results you want, but also remember it's in a higher -powers hands. Yet stay positive. Trust the process and utilize all that RMA has to offer their patients. Keep in mind RMA is distributed across multiple sites and you may not always see Dr. Doherty if you are at a satellite location. For us this wasn't an issue because Dr. Doherty was always very aware of our latest bloodwork and ultrasound and we were able to communicate often over email and phone.Email communication is best. Very responsive. Usually within an hour.Be patient with the outcome, as everyone's situation is different.  There may be a timeline given, but understand that things may take a bit longer than expected.Be patient, optimistic and trust what he is offering/doing. Don't be afraid to ask questions.Don't be afraid to ask questions. If you unsure of anything, reach out and Dr. Forman will be glad to explain the process with you.Get him as your primary doctor for your treatments!Be patient and trust him. Dr. Forman has a wealth of knowledge. Let him educate you, and encourage yourself to become an active part of your treatment. It is important to have patience with the whole process. If things get delayed for one reason or the other, there is a good reason for it and let Dr. Forman help you make educated decisions. He knows what he is doing.  I woukd tell then to be prepared to ask questions. DR Forman is very smart and would most of the time have a very rational answer. He does a very good job explaining difficult medical terminology.Trust the doctors, my husband and I did, and we were very happy with the whole process and the end result.
And just remember that every patient has a different infertility experience!He's very smart and soft spoken. Ask him any question you wish- he will answer all of them! Ask him anything, he is patient and kind and caring. He will be honest with you but you need to be honest and open to whatever he suggests in return. Come with questions and expect they will be answered honestly. They may not be the answers you want to hear but you will get nothing sugar coated bIf you have questions, make sure that you ask them and that you are satisfied with your answers.  A lot of the back and forth conversation is on the phone (usually with a nurse.)  You have the right to ask to meet with your doctor in person.  As there are many important things to discuss in your treatment.GO FOR IT.
THEY ARE TOP NOTCH, PROFESSIONAL, AND A DREAM OF A CLINIC, CONSIDERING THEIR SIZE
I would say to trust her - she knows what she's doing.Trust him.  He will be honest and design a specific plan for you. I would recommend him and would use him again.  He's very analytical and when you first meet him may come across as stoic, but as you develop a relationship with him, he's actually very warm and has an excellent bedside manner.Brace yourself for honesty. He is a good doctor and will explain in a way you can understand as much as you want to know about your diagnosis and treatment, but he also won't sugarcoat. Ultimately, though, it was his brilliant mind and his resolve to stay on the cutting edge of the field that turned over that last stone that got me pregnant with 2 healthy girls,Use him! Don't be afraid to ask questions, he is as available as he says!Trust him! :-)Don't be afraid to ask questions and get any clarifications you want. He is good at explaining things and making sure your concerns are addressed. Although the nurse is the first stop for questions, Dr. Forman was always patient when we asked him questions directly.Be sure to ask all of the questions you feel necessary. He will answer them fully and explain what you do not understandIt will take a long time. Everything will take longer than you think. I just reached a full year of treatment and have only had one retrieval, one attempted embryo transfer (failed) and only one viable embryo remaining. And because of insurance issues (that were muddied in part due to ineffective advice from the finance department), no hope of doing another retrieval unless I get new insurance.Come ready with questions on your first intro meeting. Its the most amount of time you'll spend with her in one sittingBe prepared for very little interaction with him.Dr. Foreman is very intellegent and takes his work very seriously.  He only has one thing on his mind.... a successful pregnancy which ends in a healthy birth.  Trust that Dr. Doherty will always do what is best for you. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Read Dr. Eric Forman's bio on the RMA website and watch his video.  Dr. Forman, states, ""“I traveled across the country looking for the right fellowship,” he says. “What drew me here – and why I fell in love with the program – was the opportunity to go into the embryology lab, to do research, and to be involved in cutting-edge advancements aimed at improving the field as a whole.”
After you do that - meet with him.  Dr. Forman is exceptional.  To me he is the new wave of doctors in this field - and he is truly one of the best!
Trust him!  He knows...Trust Dr. Forman. My case was against all IVF statistics but he did not give up on me like other doctors. He supported me all the way giving me hope.To trust his judgment because he is incredibly knowledgeable.  Trust him. Go see him! I would tell them everything I just mentioned in the previous question! Listen to what he has to say and whatever advice he gives you.   He knows what he is talking about and he does have your best interests in mind.Trust in him, he knows the best plan of action and will tailor it towards getting you the best result. Dr. Forman knows his stuff. Trust his recommendations. I was in a gigantic rush to be pregnant. It took my husband and I 2 and a half years to get pregnant. It felt like an eternity so by the time we met Dr. Forman and realized the reason for our struggles I just wanted to be pregnant instantly. After two egg retrievals and 9 healthy embryos later I wanted to ensure I was going to get pregnant and wanted two transferred in. Dr. Forman listened to me and then spoke to me about some of the risks of transferring two ""normal"" embryos. Thank god I listened to him! That first transfer worked. My hats off to twin mamas but I do not know how I would've functioned with two at once! Dr. Forman is always honest and is extremely talented in this field. Trust him! Go elsewhere!You are so lucky!

She is very willing to explain things and answer questions - don't hesitate to ask!You do deal with the nurses more than the actual doctor on a day-to-day basic, but if you have questions or concerns ... always feel that you can reach out to him.I would say to trust her. She is agressive with treatment when it’s needed and only has your best interests at heart. Just be patient and don’t give up.  There are so many causes of infertility and with today’s modern medicine and procedures everything is possible.  I know it’s difficult when you are dealing with such issues and finances could put a huge strain on your decision to pursue fertility treatments but there are so many options today.Trust Dr. Drews expertise and follow all protocols given to you.He is a fertility doctor, not a therapist. Lean on your spouse and those you choose to involve in the process for the emotional support you need and trust Dr. Formans judgement and expertise. Be patient. You want things to happen overnight but it is a very and unnerving slow process. Trust his opinions and trust him as a doctor. Make an appointment with her. She's terrific!Give her all your documents for previous treatments she does read everything.I would say that he is a little bit reserved in his manner but he is a wonderful man with a huge heart, which I learned first hand.You will not always see Dr. Ryback during the monitoring he is reviewing your numbers and keeping an eye on you!  Even after I went with another doctor in the clinic just due to logistics he continued to keep an eye on my progress. My advise if schedule a meeting or phone call with him, if you need attention. He probably has so many patients to keep track of. However, once you meet with him you will see how passionate he is about getting you results. He is probably spending a lot of time considering and reviewing all of his patient treatment plans. Research! Research! Research! Do you your research well about Dr. Morris. Do not settle for one doctor for consultation. At the end of the day, it is your decision to make but, in honestly, please do not pick her!Just understand that he won't be the only person working with you. Your point person will be a nurse; and other doctors could be the ones performing the procedures. But he oversees your case completely, and knows what he's doing.SPEAK UP! She will listen.Be patient with the processSpeak up to her about your needs and questions during the consult as you might not get to speak with her again for a while as you’ll see a variety of doctors during your monitoring and then speak with your nurse later. Keep your own detailed records so that you have any questions ready to go when you speak with him. I’m still in the process but I’d say to expect him to be brief and he will usually have a need student of PA with him in your exams. Even your initial consult will be with the PA Trust your Doctor and go from there. 
He speaks very fast, so I was writing my questions on paper to plan my conversation in advanceBe honest and open. You can trust him completely. It can all be extremely overwhelming. Try to take it one step at a time. Dr. Shastri and the team at RMA work really hard to cover all the bases and make sure you are receiving the best care.Be open about your expectations.Trust her and her recommendations thoroughly, she has the same end goal in mind that you do No advice needed.Ask wuestinsBreathe and trust he knows what he is talking about. He truly has so much knowledge to help you!Her frontline involvement in your process is minimal. Not to say she isn’t working behind the scene but you will not get a personal connection with her. If you are the type of person that needs all of info up front, ask for it.  They only give you as much as you need unless you ask for more.He is a caring doctor if you want a successful retreival. Don't be deceived by the look of the Hamilton office. It seems a little bit like a hole in the wall, but don't worry. Ask a lot of questions. Ask lots of questions and seek support when needed. Keep asking him, he will explain everything. Trust the process and try your best (it's hard) to be patient.  Trust him. He’s brilliant, honest, and knows what he’s doing Do what he says! He's an expert and the best of the best.Don't feel embarrassed. Ask as many questions as you need. Just go in with an open mind.He is an excellent doctor with a very kind affect. If you are feeling nervous or anxious, let him know. He will take the time to explain everything. He will be very honest if you really have something to worry about. To be aware that he talks very fast :) But don't hesitate to ask questions for clarification!!She has amazing bedside manner. She is very knowkedgeable, sweet and a hand-holder. to clearly hear him, ask pertinent questions and rely on what he says. my results were exactly what he predicted them to be.That the journey will be filled with ups and downs and there will be times when you want to give up. But if you trust Dr. Forman and give him time to get to know your indivuldual case and body,  he will never steer you wrong. Feel free to ask as many questions as you want to in order to understand what is going to be happening. Dr. M is very patient and always allows ample time for each of his patients. Be patient and while you may think he's a bit quite he will always care for your best interest. Also always try to keep hope and think for your self what is best to do. He will never tell younehat to do so try to force him to give you strong recomendations as sometimes I felt that I just needed him to tell us what would be best.He's awesome.His personality is just a little on the dry side so if you're looking for a warm and fuzzy doctor to lead you through this process, he may not be right for you. If you want someone who is honest and blunt, he will get the process moving.I would recommend Dr Forman to anyone. You can trust him completely with your care.Just to be aware that you won't always get to see Dr. Hock and that the patient should be prepared for that. Just expect her not to be overly warm or joyous for you. I think she’s very knowledgeable, but I just didn’t connect with her. Do your research and know the field, and ask tons of questions. He will always happily answer and take the time to insure you understand exactly what is going on. Be prepared to feel comfortable with the entire process. She will make you feel that this is such a natural and normal thing. She is not the most warm and fuzzy person, but she knows what she is doing!Feel free to ask questions. They will answer them. It's better to understand everything as it's a long processBe open and honestGo and don’t be shy. Ask questions, no question is a dumb question. He will answer all with care. Wonderful to interact with Dr. Jurema, however, you will see a variety of different practitioners throughout the process.Just be direct with your expectations and let him know that you trust his experience and judgment.  Be open and honest as Dr shastri will guide you along the way. Email her any time you don’t understand something. Call early. It can sometimes take a while to get an appointment with her. And she may keep you waiting sometimes, but only because she’s trying to give every patient the time and attention they need.Ask questions if you have hem. She will answer. Be honest about your worries and concerns. She will listen to you and explain answers to questions and worries you have. If you are looking for someone that has a warm, maternal nature about here this is the doctor to see.Be honest about what you want and she will do her best to get you there Ask lots of questions. Write down everything and ask questions even if you feel they are dum questions. Ask a lot of questions and explanations. Not sure about other fertility doctors, but I’m use to doctors explaining everything to me and have a plan. They’re really just there to get you pregnant and figure out what is going on and what they can do to get you to point. But just ask a lot of questions and don’t hesitate to ask everything you want to know. wirte you self down your Q so you dont forget to ask in the mountains of information Go for it! Let her know your questions and if you need more time with her personally: Don't hesitate to call/email him questions or concerns. He always gets back to you quickly! I would say that Dr Forman is soft spoken but he is smart and he cares.For any doctor.Take notes. Write down questions be prepared when meeting with doctor.easier on emotions.and understanding what's next

I wish I had started sooner!She may not be very warm and fuzzy, but she is smart and caring and will do everything she can to get you results.There are probably many great doctors at RMA NJ, so it's important to rely on your instinct when choosing one to work with. advocate for yourself, do you own research and ask questions accordinglyDon't be afraid of asking him questions...he'll answer any question you have (even if he already answered the question). I would tell a prospective patient to just listen to what she has to say because she knows what she is talking about. Make sure you come in educates and prepared Review your records for accuracy. I would say not to get frustrated if Dr. Yih isn't able to be at every appointment or monitoring hour. She genuinely cares for the patients and takes part in both the joys and sadness that occur along the way. She is so supportive. Explore all your options and write all the questions down before your consultation He makes such a hard and emotional experience as easy as it can be.I'd prefer it if I was in the basking ridge office, since I'd see her more often, but overall very happy with her and RMA NJ trust himMy advice is not specific to her, just in general, ask as many questions as you have and don't be afraid to do so. He is amazing and you are one lucky person to be under his care.Go with her As with anyone, ask questionsJust be aware she does not perform the egg retrieval or transfer, it will be another RMA Doctor.

Keep and open mind, listen, and be patientBe open, be honest. He has heard it all.

Don't dismiss the other doctors - they are excellent at documentation so self manage care wasn't necessary like all other doctors I've seen outside the world of IVFYou can trust him 100% Prepare & ask questions....she will answer you but may not tell you everything. I learned that being as relaxed about the process can make a difference. Meaning, on the day of your transfer, do you best & whatever it takes to keep relaxed & to not worry...a relaxed recipient helps the implantation.It is difficult and you have to remain positive.Ask for Christine Rose as your nurse. Use him Definitely come prepared with your questions, and don't be afraid to speak up for yourself.

Listen to his instructions.Encouraging Be honest and take his adviceDon't be afraid of asking any questions you have regarding the treatment and all the little details, no matter how simplistic you might think your questions are.

There is comfort in knowing you are in the best hands. Ask questions up frontDon’t be afraid to ask a lot of questions.

58,RMA of New Jersey,nurse,"Extremely quick to communicate, went out of her way for us as I sometimes need more information to get the right medication in my home country, very supportive and always explained everything in detail which we wanted to knowMaryellen was an incredible asset to our care at RMANJ. She is extremely knowledgable and compassionate and always did everything she could to help facilitate our care without delays, barriers, or inconveniences. She has been truly wonderful to work with. I communicate with my nurse primarily over email and I prefer it that way.  It works best for my schedule. Jennifer is caring and very organized. I feel comfortable reaching out to her with any questions that I have and she always returns my calls or emails promptly. After learning about my negative pregnancy test, she called me just to see how I was doing. I had two nurses during the two and a half years that I was a patient at RMA. Both nurses were extremely nice and always called after the several procedure that I had to see how I was feeling. Once starting the IVF cycle, my nurse was extremely helpful and clearly communicated instructions to be taken. I had many questions during the cycle and would E-mail my nurse frequently. Like Dr. Forman she would respond to all my E-mails before the end of the day.Danielle was very sweet and nice and always got back to my when i had a question or concern. However there were many instances where she was unavailable bc of vacation and this actually fell right around my trigger shot for my retrieval. I felt I had a relationship with her so I was upset when it was not her giving me instructions. Eve was also a great part of the team. I asked MANY questions and she never made me feel like I was a number. She made sure I felt comfortable with any questions before we started and all the instructions during a cycle. She was a great partner through this process.  My nurse Joyce was great. She always called me the same day with the results, instructions, and any questions I needed answered. She was very knowledgeable and was able to answer all my questions. They were great.  Nice to be assigned to one nurse- but then she left abruptly, which was odd. But was picked up by another immediatelyThey are very attentive and communicate with you through every step of the process. They always get back to you to answer questions or concerns the day you call.Jandra answered all questions I had (I had a lot) immediately and always returned my calls or answered my emails even after hours and on weekends.Maryellen was good with communication and calling me with results and instructions. However she seems not comfortable with email communications which was my prefered way of communication. My nurse was excellent with coordinating my fertility schedule with my life schedule. She allowed me to ask anything and everything and always responded quickly. Samantha is amazing!  She is caring, compassionate and understanding.  She gets back to you immediately and always call you right away with updates and next steps.  She was so helpful in navigating all of the different procedures and medications including ordering meds, how to use the meds and any questions I had on any part of the process!   This journey is emotionally difficult and Samantha held my hand through the whole process.  She was alway there to answer a question (no matter how crazy) or help calm me in moments of fear or sadness and she shared in the times of excitement!!  She is the absolute best!!!  I couldn’t have done this without her!!! She is wonderful she always gets back to me immediately when I need something if she is off he colleague answers. She helped me after a procedure I had and had some
Pain and issues and had me come in right away to be examined. She walked me through the whole process and answers all my questions. She is soft spoken and compassionate Lauren was amazing and we are so thankful she was our nurse.  She was very organized, always responded promptly to any messages I left, and clearly communicated everything we needed to know. Quickly responded to every call/email with kindness.  There were definitely times that I was hot headed and she calmed me down with a thorough and detailed response.Jennifer is THE best! She is calm and caring and on top of things. Jenn would call when she knew I was able to talk (I'm a teacher) and explained everything thoroughly every time. She answered ALL of my questions and calmed my fears when I lost it emotionally. Jennifer became part of my life and I looked forward to talking to her each day. She would even call in between procedures while we were waiting for results just to check in and say hello. She invested herself into our case and called on her day off to congratulate us. I will keep in touch with Jennifer- I love her! Nicole was my primary point of contact throughout my treatment (IVF/FET) cycles. She would call me back with results, instructions and next steps in a timely manner. On days when she was out of office, the person covering would always reach out in a timely manner as well. She promptly responded to all my phone calls and emails.Kathy was truly a blessing. I could not have asked for a more caring and compassionate nurse. She was prompt to give me information and respond to all my questions and concerns. She also acted as my advocate when needed. All the women staff in the Springfield office were also very kind and welcoming. I appreciate all they have done. Marissa has been amazing! Despite the size of RMA, we really do feel Marissa is our personal nurse and that she is 100% focused on only us. She shows great compassion towards our concerns and anxiety. She responds by email (our preferred method) often within an hour or two. She is always available for questions during bloodwork/ultrasound visits. She even spent 30 minutes teaching us how to perform the progesterone injections. We couldn't ask for a better nurse. My most-recent nurse, Ann Marie, is also extremely compassionate and thorough.  She kept in contact with me very efficiently, and I never had to worry about hearing from her or having a question answered.  She returned all of my phone calls very promptly, and we had an extremely great rapport with one another. Anne was absolutely wonderful.  She was my main line of communication and was incredibly easy to reach.  Some days she would call me multiple times to update me and see how I was doing.  She didn't let any setbacks get to me and kept reminding me of the end goal.  I would highly recommend her.  I thought Joyce was excellent. Very organized, on top of everything in what must be a stressful job. Very patient as well, and understanding.

The only thing that would have made my overall experience better was a different/better mode of walking me through the injections. That was the hardest part for me, and I had to cancel a cycle because I gave myself the wrong injection at one point.Lynette was an awesome nurse to me. I actually miss talking to her! She was professional yet friendly and compassionate. I recommend her highly. Eve was a light through this dark process. She was reliable with her communication and would always call when she said she would. She would explain everything in detail to me. She would listen to all of my questions and even listened when I would cry. She is simply the best. Brianna is a wonderful nurse and advocate. She always provides with clear instructions and great solutions to common problems. She is very receptive to emails. She is quick to respond and always willing to lend an ear when needed. My nurse was not very informed and tended to direct any questions I had back to Dr. Jurema. She wasn’t straight forward with information which was frustrating for me. The nurses were available as much as possible. Sometimes I felt like they weren’t as warm as the doctors but I know they are very busy. Sometimes it was hard to reach them right away but would receive call backs within 24 hours. I never met them in person, this was a phone nurse. Her name is Lauren Bizub and she always returns your call by the end of the day.My nurse gave me clear instructions on what medication/procedure I need to take each time. I was seldom confused about what I needed to do. Whenever I had questions, my nurse was able to followup with me within 24 hours.My nurse could not have been better. She was very friendly, knowledgeable, understanding, organized, prompt and thorough.Her compassion, attention to detail, and the love she has for her job and patients. She helped us through some extremely hard times. She cried with us when we lost our son and celebrated with us when our daughter was born. She wasn't just our nurse, she was like a mother to us. We love Amy!!! She called me as soon as my results were in, every time! She answered all our questions and is so nice!!Extremely organized and on top of everything. I don’t trust anyone else like I trust her.Julie was amazing! Always kind and informative. Julie C.  Was not very friendly or compassionate. As it was my first time undergoing treatment and testing, she would talk down to me when I asked questions. She also would not listen to anything I said in relation to what the doctor and I discussed In an appt. Lisa was very nice. She communicated with me and emailed me to answer my concerns and questions. She was very detailed especially with my blood work because I asked for it. She understands my feelings and concerns and communicated with sr. Chu as well. They were all fantastic, very thorough, made sure I never left with questions. My primary nurse was the most amazing, caring person. I really felt like she cared. She answered all of my questions, no matter how many or how big or small. She was great over email and on the phone. Always got back to me very quickly. The rest of the nursing staff were also wonderful--those seen during procedures were attentive and helpful.The nursing staff does a good job of not instilling hope where there is none. Our nurse Jen was absolutely amazing. She helped me along every step of the way and was immensely supportive throughout the entire process. So, so wonderful! Beth is patient and warm and encouraging too. Jill, the other nurse in Marlton, is also wonderful!Excellent communicator. Unlimited patience to respond silly, original, ignorant, repetitive and reasonable daily questions. Ability to patiently explain every days procedures multiple times. Provided great support and was always available.
Amy was wonderful.  She always called me with my results or questions I needed to be answered promptly.  I am very grateful to have had Amy as my nurse,Very responsive I had to follow up at times to get a full explanation of what to expect for upcoming treatment because directions that were given confused me.  However I did get prompt responses from my nurse, Jill. How she was always there. I always knew I could call or email and she would get back to me. Even when she patiently explained things once she would always do it again if I needed it.Very tough to get in touch with her. Impossible to even call directly. They have a secure email system which doesn't work half the time. Got the sense the nurses are really overburdened with too many patients. Hard to ever have a live convo on phone - endless voicemails!Alana was always available to answer questions and I felt she really cared about my outcome. She is the best So organized it surprised me. Everything was coordinated seamlessly. Wait times were always reasonable. Joyce is a miracle worker. She is kind, empathetic and patient.  She is beyond invested.  She has helped me maintain my sanity.  Other than our children Joyce is the best part of our RMA experience The most contact came from her. She was quick to respsond, reassuring and NEVER dismissiveShe was extremely smart, very good communicator and would always return my calls within a reasonable amount of time. She really got to know me and understood the best way to discuss issues with meShe was so available, so responsive, and so able to work with me at my pace. She always returned my calls and made sure I understood exactly what I needed to doThe care staff and coordinator were very organized. Samantha was amazing!  She always called as well as emailed me next step instructions so that I was sure to have them in writing for reference later.  She even helped out again after I had officially graduated from the clinic.  I was away on vacation and had forgotten my needed amount of Endometrin.  I reached out to her and she was immediately able to call in a prescription for me at a pharmacy near our hotel.  She went above and beyond.  I always got a call when they said they would. I was never left waiting or wondering what my next plan of action would be.Very communicative,  always called and explained about medication and all blood result very well Jen was great. Knowledgable, on top of things, compassionate, and calmAlana was always quick to answer my questions or respond to emails. She was patient with me and ensured I knew who to speak with if she would be out of the office. I appreciated feeling as though she knew my care plan personally instead of being passed from nurse to nurse.Very nice, responsive and patience Beth is one of the most compassionate people we've met, and she is incredibly knowledgeable about all forms of treatment and care. If I had a question about anything between visits, I could call or email Beth and she'd get back to me within the hour. I never really had a chance to worry about anything because I got the answers I needed right away. She's a really wonderful person and we always enjoyed seeing her. The nursing staff was amazing, from my coordinator to the blood draw techs to the front office manager. They were professional, prompt, empathetic, and very supportive. She is extremely responsive to emails and phone calls (emails, usually within thirty minutes). Words can't explain how amazing my nurse, Jen G., has been. She is an extremely talented and efficient communicator. She is kind and compassionate and will be your advocate when needed. When choosing a doctor to use after our doctor moved to another state, my decision really hinged on whether Jen could be my nurse again. She is really that amazing. The primary nurse Christine was the only reason we trusted to stay for a second round. She was helpful but it also felt that she didn’t have time. She seemed to be the only one working in the clinic. I feel that if she had less on her plate our cycles would have been more successful. The ordering of medication was incorrect both cycles. The first cycle we confirmed the list of medications we had and that it was correct before we started. The day before we learned that it was not correct and had to order a trigger shot. The entire cycle was almost lost due to their lack of care or time. I partially blame the stressed RMA directly caused me for my first failed round. I don't remember all the ""primary"" nurses assigned to me throughout the course of my three retrieval cycles but here are the ones I dealth with most. 
1. Blair - No longer with RMANJ - Atrocious, She would sigh when I called and lacked an sort of compassion whatsoever. This was impactful as it was my first cycle ever. She was also disorganized and missed key details in my care.
2. Josephine Z. - The best nurse I had in my entire experience at RMANJ. Kind, compassionate, friendly, smart and organized, She got pregnant and was out for a portion of my care but was excellent.
3. Merry D. - Smart, well versed in infertility experienced. I was disappointed when she got promoted and didn't take 30 seconds to email me that she would no longer be my nurse. I found that unprofessional.
4. So uninvolved I don't even remember her name.
5. Nicole B. - Friendly but unattached and didn't really care about my care. Just rather matter of fact and robotic providing instructions. Note: When receiving egg retreival and pregnancy test results I NEVER got a call from my primary nurse. It was always some random nurse.  Literally every single time. Nurse Lynette was great. She explained everything very well. She accommodated me by calling me after 4 pm because I leave work at 4 pm. Or she would email me in case I was not able to be reached. Josephine is amazing. She got back to me within an hour or 2 always And always called me back during emergencies. Unfortunately she went on medical leave and I got a fill in nurse who I am not crazy about. I don’t have a strong connection with her like I had with JosephineJessica is empathic, organized and on top of everything. She’s great.Merry is always super sweet and willing to answer any questions I have. She’s been with the practice since the start and is so well versed with everything. She’s been a wonderful help through this process. I’ve dealt mostly with Vileena, my dedicated nurse (but the other nursing staff have been excellent as well).

Vileena is extremely responsive via phone or email, and has always treated me with respect and compassion. She too understands that I’m a VERY involved patient who knows what’s happening with my treatment, and doesn’t dumb down information for me. She’s also really personable and truly cares about me and my spouse as PEOPLE, not just patients.I started the journey assigned to one nurse a month or so into the process when I tried calling her I was told by the front office staff that she no longer worked there. My new nurse seemed to come in and throw a bunch of things at me that the other one never mentioned. I could never get her on the phone when I called but she would always return my voicemails. Sometimes she would give me all my numbers from bloodwork and sometimes she wouldn't.There were times I left messages or sent emails and didn’t hear back until I followed up again a day or 2 later with another form of communication, usually the opposite of what I had last done, email or phone call. Then I would finally hear back.   These were usually questions that were not immediately urgent like a medication question for that day, but I still was surprised at times when I didn’t hear back in 24 hours. I gave them the benefit of doubt. I’m not the type a person who calls repeatedly and one day if it’s not an emergency.  As my cycle progressed I did feel a little more at ease with her.  They were quick to get things in order so that I could pay before starting a cycle or moving to the next part. But then once I didn’t make it to transfer and I had questions about what we could do next and deciding if we would do donor egg or what we would do I feel like it went back again to pretty irresponsive and days in between my emails and questions. Eve was extremely kind and compassionate. Also very thorough when calling with test results and always kept me posted on what’s next. Kim would call me and answer any email questions right away. There are several departments, one for meds, one for financial, etc. She wouldn't pass me around unnecessarily and helped me during med delivery,  etc.We really enjoyed/appreciated that we had our own nurse, and she was AMAZING! Beth was always available to talk with, and if she was unable to answer, she always returned our call in a timely fashion. She also had very good bed-side manner, in addition to a positive attitude which was always so pleasant, especially when I was having a rough time/day. One time in particular we thought we would not receive our medication in time. Beth sat down with us, listened to the concerns we expressed and reassured us that all would work out; that we would find a way regardless of what needed to be done. Her calm and confident disposition assisted me in calming down as well. I called her after we suspended our care with RMA, as I had a few questions. We engaged in conversation for a decent amount of time. She expressed genuine concern about how we were doing, in addition to other matters. Never once did she attempt to rush me off the phone, or display any negativity in the amount of time it took to address/resolve our concerns. We went to a previous infertility clinic and did not receive anywhere near the same personal care.She explained everything and was very compassionate Alana was such a comforting part of this whole process. She was quick to call with results and answer questions, always eager to help. She even called to check in months after my fertility preservation. Amy is great. She's quick to respond to all my questions and is through in explaining the process for me. The rest of the nurses at the clinic are fantastic too! Jackie has been a god-send during this process.  She has a very upbeat personality and is always willing to talk or answer any questions I may have.  Marissa has been with me since day 1 which is  May 2017. She is professional, organized and consistent.   She is compassionate and just great at what she does.  Her communication skills are strong.  She listens carefully, answers all questions and if she does not know the answer  follows up.  She communicates both on email and phone and has a sense of urgency when  needed.  My nurse Kira was the best communicator throughout my infertility treatment process. She called me after every visit with updates and next steps, which was at least one a week! As a teacher, it is difficult for me to answer my phone at any time during the day, so Kira would always ask for the times that I am most available or leave me detailed voicemails and a number to call her back with any questions that I had. She was understanding, compassionate, and extremely knowledgeable.Samantha was the most understanding and compassionate nurse I have met through this process. She addressed every concern and question I had immediately, never making me wait long for information. She also allowed me to provide suggestions about how I wanted my care to be carried out and assisted in adjusting things when I requested it.The nurses are very thorough, especially Julie who was assigned to me. She was always prompt in returning my calls and would listen to all of my concerns. She is clearly well versed in all things fertility and is very efficient in keeping tabs on what I should be doing and checking in with me.My nurse was nice. The only problem was, she had a variable schedule and I was often having to be in contact with other nurses in order to figure things out. So there was a little confusion on who to contact when, but overall it was fine.Lauren was excellent. She responded to my questions quickly, followed up in a timely manner and always provided clear instructions. 
When she was on vacation the other nurses that covered for her were all great. Each of the nurses on the team were truly wonderful-so involved and patient. Eve and Vileena were great to work with as well. I would have no reservations working with their dream team again.Sarah is amazing. She always called me so fast with my results and never minded that I e-mailed her with a bunch of questions that I had. She always answered all my e-mails and questions. She is so GOOD!Rhonda is well versed in infertility treatment, however she could come off abrasive at times. I do think it was coming from a place of care/concern, but my husband had a very difficult time with her style of communication.Kira was compassionate and always tried her best. She contacted me as quickly as she possibly could. My nurse Danielle was just as valuable throughout this process as Dr. Hong - truly when you're at RMA you spend more time communicating directly with your nurse, so Danielle's role was huge. She called me frequently and quickly with results, updates, and sometimes even just a reassuring check-in.  Danielle felt like my biggest cheerleader - someone who wanted to see me be successful.  She helped me understand each new medication or protocol and was so incredibly patient with my many questions and concerns.  She was wonderful.  Very sweet and compassionate and responded quickly to emails.  Julie was my primary nurse and was very good at getting in contact with me via phone calls or email. She did show compassion and was very helpful throughout the process.Both nurses were extremely helpful.  Even after moving to the next clinic and having RMA for outside monitoring christine has continued to be super helpful in setting up monitoring appointments and providing encouragement.Hillary was a good communicator and answered all of my concerns. She would update me with all of my blood work results promptly and schedule me for all of my weekly appointments.My nurse was amazing.  She was so prompt with emails and calling with results, really took the time to show me how to use some of the medications and spent one morning with me when I was very emotional - she took time out of her schedule to listen to me, give me a shoulder to lean on and acted as a friend when I needed it.  She always answered my questions and was very prompt at obtaining information from the doctor when I requested it.The nurses are assigned to each patient, so you feel like a person, not a number.   My nurse was patient with me and tried to do what she could to help me.She tried to follow-up in timely manner. I had quite a few questions as the cycle progressed and she answered them throughly and explained why she provided the answer. Sometimes the transfer of information did not go smoothly when she was out of the office and another nurse was in charge of my case.I only had one in person interaction with Dayna, the rest were all phone calls, but each one has been very positive. She is highly energetic, optimistic, and empathetic. She is very responsive and takes the time to explain each step and answer my questions. She has exceeded my expectations for nursing support at a clinic as huge as RMA NJ.Michelle was AMAZING! I have no other words but wonderful things to say about Michelle, she was compassionate, straight forward, and always on top of my medical care. I know she had a lot of others to deal with but I felt like I was her number one priority all the time.Amazing!!!! So responsive and compassionate. I felt that she was with me every step of the way. She made the experience manageable and easy to navigate. Any and all of my questions and concerns were answered within 24 hours, usually less. My insurance gave me a hard time and she helped me with that. Cannot say enough good things about Beth!There were times I was frustrated by the nursing situation. Many times RMA runs like a well oiled Machine And you are expected to  just trust your team.  That is not my personality, and I like knowing the details and reasoning for each procedure/medicine adjustment.  After explaining this and requesting my documented paperwork - I received more explicit detailed messages and feel happier about the situation.  I also recently received a new nurse assignment and appreciate her style much more than my original assigned nurse.Beth is highly competent, organized, knowledgeable, and responsive. When we met with her at the consultation she provided her direct email address and direct phone number so I knew I could always reach her if I need to. She has been great at answering our questions and walking us through the process and guiding us on what to expect every step of the way. She has been supportive of us through the ups and downs, the worries, the hopes and the fears. When Beth is not available or out of the office the other nurses have also been responsive and communicative. RMA-NJ is a well oiled machine and you never feel like you're treatment is slipping through the cracks. Everyone on the team knows what's going on.  Jill is very detail oriented and includes all the information you will need to understand your treatment plan. She calls when she says she will and answersquestions accordingly.ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. Bloodwork was back within 3 hours, and they called right away.Our nurse is compassionate, organized and caring. She has been a good support during this time. While out of cycle I sometimes struggled getting a hold of her as her automatic out-of-office reply seems to begin in early afternoon. However, I don't remember this being an issue while in cycle; she was easy to get in touch with and correspondence was reciprocated quickly.We have been with Joyce through our whole process and she is amazing. She is smart, organized, and compassionate. Dayna is energetic, positive and fun.  She didn't waste time with all the cliches - ""it only takes one"" etc - stuff like that. But instead said ""hey if it doesn't work, we try again.""  And I liked feeling like she was going to be with me the entire time through this process. For most of my treatment I had an amazing nurse who I had a great repore with and felt that she totally knew her stuff and was always there for me.  However, for my final Ivf cycle Kelly had to take a leave of absence and so I was given another nurse, she was horrible and basically it was a good thing that I had gone through so many previous rounds to know that muliple times she was giving me the wrong information.My nurse was great in the beginning. She was helpful with testing. But anytime treatments changed she only gave me the new plan I never got the why answered. A few times I had to go directly to Dr M to get that answered. She also didn’t give warning when she went away the week I was about to start treatment. No other nurse picked up so I felt very out of the loop on what to expect when starting my mediciation. Luckily my pharmacy had a nurse call me and walk me through the meds. My nurse never did that. I brought this up and she was apologetic and if it worked no harm done but if it didn’t I will wonder if her offering tips and more instructions might have made a difference. Josephine responded promptly to my calls and needs. A huge issue was with the Finance department, who forgot to include the embryo genetic testing in the price when we paid. This resulted in having to pay it later on the day of retrieval which was stressful and came with other conflicts.Amazing, I feel like I talked to her all the time.  She was very good at explaining this and I never waited to long for a phone call back. Sue has been wonderful throughout this process.  She is always timely in her communications, thorough in her instructions, and sensitive to the process.  I have not experienced any negatives under her care.Lisa knew that fully understanding results and treatments were important to me.  She always returned my calls same day and addressed all questions and concerns before 5 PM every time I called.  If she was not going to be in the office during when I would normally get results or updates from her, she would email or call to let me know and who would be covering for her.  I never felt like a bother to Lisa and she was always extremely patient with me!I've had several nurses throughout my journey. My first, Kathy Giordano, was amazing. I still keep in contact with her. I had another one transfer and then I asked to have a new nurse after she gave me incorrect details. My current nurse is also fabulous. She answers quickly and is always on top of things.Amazing. On top of my care, kind, courteous, attentive, answers all my questions, works through every detail. We had a special case with our timing and they were always sensitive to that. Just awesome.My nurse did answer some questions if I called the clinic and she would call me back with the answer usually within a day. She would also email me if needed.  She was nice but I still feel that we were not taken seriously because of our ages. when I would contact the clinic about having specific forms filled out I felt like I got the run around and one time we missed getting the forms to the Baby Quest grant people in time because of a miscommunication with either the nursing staff or the doctorDayna is thorough and compassionate she has coordinated my care so far and gets back to all of my questions by end of day.  When I learned that I would need surgery she was out on vacation and the nurse filling in was great, but what stood out to me is that she even called to check in on me when she returned from her vacation.Joyce Maloney is the most AMAZING nurse... I am SO lucky that I was assigned to her caseload. She is the best... so organized, detailed, compassionate and always followed through. She always called me in a timely fashion with my personal results and thorough directions of what to do next. I wish everyone would have the same experience with their nurse.Both Adrienne and Michelle were responsive within one business day of emails and phone calls. They would seek answers to my questions through the doctor.My nurse and nursing staff are very friendly and understand the feeling involved in the process. They returned my calls quickly and was patient with any and all anxiety phone calls.Josephine is great. Very clear, detailed, and responsive. And I always feel like she is totally familiar with my case and my history, which I appreciate. I spoke with my nurse Rhonda more than I spoke with my mom in a given week. No matter how many questions I had she was always patient and honest. She worked with me when I didn’t want to travel from Brooklyn to NJ for blood work. She was always making my religious concerns a priority. She was always upbeat and funny I always smiled when I spoke with her. She was so organized and made the whole process smooth and not overwhelming. Even though I saw her just once but spoke hundreds of times over the phone. I made a true friend. Jill can be difficult. She showed compassion when my cycle was cancelled due to a cyst but was very frustrating to work with around weight, despite me being overweight due to the PCOS I am in treatment for. She can also be quite rigid, so push back if something doesn’t feel right and ask to speak to your MD if she tells you nothing can be done. She was vague in wording with drug instructions a few times as well. Nursing care was adequate but as a nirse myself I feel I needed less than others mayMaryellen is extremely knowledgable and caring.  When I contact her, I always receive a promt and detailed response in easy to understand language.  She is a rock for me in this very delicate process.While be Breanna always had a very positive demeanor and tone of voice, I just felt like I was getting dribs and drabs of information. Just the immediate next step for the next morning or the next day. I always felt like I had to follow up and ask more questions about what the bigger picture next steps would be.My nurse support changed midway through my treatment. My support has been pretty good with the exception of some confusion once they had a new urologist start with them and had some issues with coordinating with this new doctor for my husband. Some tests slipped through the cracks but overall I have been well supported.Dayna was absolutely wonderful to work with. She always provided a full report of my testing results, as well as explained in detail every step of our treatment process. She showed compassion as well when I was overly anxious. Beth was incredible - she was so caring and supportive.  she expressed her emotions openly and was sad when things didn't work out and genuinely happy when they did.  I know she honestly cared about me.  She was also very good with helping me with injections and I had a fear of needlesMy nurse is very blunt. I would prefer her to be a little more positive, but I guess she is trying to stay realistic. The other doctors/nurses seem a bit more positive though. She is thorough with information. I wish she would have showed me in person re: the injections instead of sending me videos.Jandra is wonderful and has been my rock throughout this process thus far. She gets back to my questions quickly and has really provided a lot of support throughout this process as my first doctor had unexpectedly left the practice. Rhonda can be “tough” but in a loving way. She wants to make sure you are receiving ththe best care possible and you are also on top of speaking with the insurance companies, genetic counseling... She was very organized, always gave detailed instructions and replied very timely to voicemails and emails. Jenn is an awesome nurse.  Always calls every few days to check on me.  Was calling almost everyday after my awful retrieval.  Very caring.  Always has information for me when I call.  Calls on days I have morning monitoring are always by noon or around there.  I feel like she is invested in my success. My nurses were so organized, always available and I do not know how they kept up with each appointment and procedure that I had to get done. She always made sure to have appointments set up - she was amazing!Jordanna is sweet, humorous, and always gets back to me the same day.My nurse is very good at calling with instructions or bloodwork results.  She is not good at the personal stuff. When my mom died, she did not tell the dr. She also is very abrupt in conversation.I can not remeber the name of the my primary nurse but she was great ! The patient portal made it easy to upload records and if she needed something she got back to right away.Nurse beth. I cannot say enough good things. She walked me through every step of the way and assured me with any questions I had. She quickly responded to any messages I left and I never felt like she as bothered by me, even though I was “high needs”. I never felt confused with the shots because she explained everything in detail and spent the time with me to make this overwhelming process very easy and relaxed.Lynette was always on top of things - sending me detailed descriptions of care plans and medication plans and responding to my questions quickly and thoroughly. Overall I've found her to be extremely considerate, caring, and professional. The only downsides of the nursing care at RMA are 1) Lynette was my third nurse in about a 6 month time period, which made my experience feel a bit disjointed; 2) I'm not sure if this is more about RMA or individual nurses, but I don't think there's much of an effort to figure out patient's preferred communication styles, e.g. email, phone, time of day, etc. I found I was always missing phone messages and had to follow up via email and some of that could have been resolved if the info was emailed to me from the start or calls weren't always placed during my morning commute :)My Nurse was Nancy, who is no longer a full time Nurse at RMA.  She was absolutely wonderful.  She was thorough, caring, compassionate and on top of her game.  I never had to wonder about any testing, appointments or medications. She was always available to answer any questions I had or help me with a problem. As an example, the day before my retrieval, there were some issues thatthe finance office hadn't handled properly and she made sure that everything was taken care of so that we wouldn't have to worry. I'm sad I won't have her as my nurse when we try for our next baby. Nursing didn’t feel personalized enough for me. Patrice is actually a PA, not a nurse. I felt she was very responsive to my concerns, extremely patient with me (my anxiety got the best of me during this process and she would spend a long time on the phone with me answering my giant lists of questions). She was compassionate and intelligent and I trusted her as much as I trusted the doctors. Samantha was great. She called me every day when I went in with the results of the U/S and blood work. She was always available by phone and email to answer my questions. My nurse became my biggest supporter and I felt as if she was on this journey with me.  Always encouraging me and reminding me to stay positive and focused.  I absolutely adore Dayna for being genuine and candid.  I was able to ask her questions that I would normally be too embarrassed to even ask my girlfriends.  It's hard to talk about this topic for me but Dayna was more than just my nurse; it felt like she became my biggest fan.  She was always in a good mood when she called me and even when it wasn't the best news, she was incredibly compassionate and knowledgeable.  All of the nurses that I met at RMA were lovely but Dayna seemed to go above and beyond with keeping me organized, positive, calm, educated and focused.Dr. Morris has one primary nurse. Joyce is always on top of her calls. Whether it's calling you back after you leave a message to answer any questions or to give you results and/or instructions  from morning monitoring she always calls you in a timely fashion Our nurse Rachel was amazing! She was extremely responsive to emails and phone calls. She answered are questions and concerns thoroughly and in a kind and caring manner. During our treatment process I spoke to Rachel on the phone multiple times a week. She was great!Jen was excellent and compassionate and answered all my questions and took the time.  She would get me an answer from Dr. Forman if she didn't know the answer or if I asked her to check with Dr. Forman.  All of the staff at the clinic are friendly, knowledgeable within their roles, and compassionate towards the patients - it really makes a difference.  We left other clinics because we didn't feel that way and are so happy we made the choice to switch.Kira is always willing to answer our questions and never seems to get annoyed when we have a lot of questions and concerns. She shows both passion and an ability to answer our questions knowledgeably.Michelle O is very positive and kind.  I felt so hopeful about our treatment when I was talking with her.  She helped me understand what would be involved in my evaluation and where we could go for various aspects of the tests, preferred labs etc.The nurses have the toughest job in this process.  I always felt rushed when speaking with the nursing staff and I often would have to ask for info to be repeated or ask for detailed info.   This is one area where I feel they could do with some more help.  The info I was given was always spot on and fantastic, but it just was so fast My nurse Michelle is INCREDIBLE.  She is the true lifeline through this painful and emotional process.  She handles herself professionally, but she also has displayed a great deal of compassion to my situation.  Gwendolyn is very knowledgeable and prompt in returning phone calls, answering questions and giving results. She is very caring .Well it was hard because as I was starting IVF my nurse left for another clinic.  I think that they assign the nurses WAY TOO MANY patients.  It's hard to be organized and on the same page when this happens so I don't really blame them at all.  I think she did the best she could.My primary nurse, Christine, and the entire staff have been great.  Even when I'm staggering in for monitoring half-asleep at 6am, they are cheerful, patient, but still efficient.  There are two regular phlebotomists in the office and I've had so many blood draws that I know which one prefers which arm.  They all know me by name at this point. Nicole Baumert is awesome! She always answers no matter how silly or personal a question may seem. She cares very much. After our loss she reached out personally several times to check on me and definitely helped get me support and through it all. I wouldn't trade her for anything!Anne is no longer with RMA. She left during my IVF cycle, and I only found out when I visited the RMA office to do my loss panel due to my miscarriage. She didn't educate me on the medications, often times made me feel like a nuisance when I asked questions too.  Staff during morning monitoring in the future, were great. The West Orange office staff is very nice.I started with Jordanna, who was very receptive to all of my questions and was available regularly via email. When she went on leave, I was transferred to Alana, who has been excellent about communicating my results and very patient as my husband and I mulled over whether to start with IVF.Merry is very experienced and she is up to the point, unfortunately I never had chance to meet her personally. She is quite responsive in email and phone call. Merry was a pleasure to deal with.  She was easy to get in touch with and provided reasonable explanations for any questions.  She also showed much compassion and care after suffering losses.Lauren Bizub was great, very understanding through all our ups and downs.  There were one or two other nurses however that did not seem to really understand the emotional trouble that goes along with the IVF process. After my first transfer I miscarried at seven weeks. One of the nurses called to tell me that I needed to return to the office for further blood work I explained that I was not in an emotional state to return to the office that week. Instead of verbalizing understanding of my feelings, she just kept on insisting. As a nurse practitioner myself I had to explain to her that going to the office Was an emotional experience in and of itself after a miscarriage and D&C.  I explained that I just needed a few days to get myself together. Unfortunately the nurse did not seem to be very understanding or compassionate. I have to say, that part was very disappointing. My doctor and nurse however we’re great.I had an emergency after an IUI and Jennifer was my point of contact. She was calming, caring and checked on me frequently. The entire nursing team is efficient and communicates effectively.Nurse Michelle was trained by Nurse Danielle and it shows.  Michelle is a wonderful nurse that I trust completely.  She is very knowledgeable and always answers my questions.  I am so very lucky to have her.When I was pregnant the first time around, I was assigned to a nurse named Cely. She was fantastic, but unfortunately she no longer works full time at RMA. The second time I was pregnant, my nurse was Mary Ellen. She was okay... seemed to lack some compassion and I felt as though she really viewed her job as just that... a job. Overall, the staff is great however!I loved my first nurse, Tanya. She was very kind. I was petrified of giving myself injections and didn't feel comfortable learning from a video; She offered me to come to the office and she showed me how to give myself the injections. She also gave me her cell number in case I had questions when giving myself injections. She truly cared about her patients. Unfortunately, toward the end of my time at RMA Tanya got a new job and I got a new nurse. The new nurse was not located in the location I went to and I didn't find her as warm. Christine was a very good communicator. She answered all of my questions in a timely manner. We began treatment with Tanya who was very helpful and informative. Tanya left the practice in the middle of our cycle and then we had Zahava who was very attentive and informative as well.Danielle was great for the most part.  She could take a little more time with medication explanations while over the phone or send extremely detailed emails to ensure that everything is explained and understood to a patient going through this forthe first time.  She did not explain the importance of genetic counseling as that created an unnecessary waiting period in an already long process.Joyce was fantastic in every way. She was thorough in her instructions and information, caring and supportive during this anxiety-ridden time, and always responded to my messages in a very timely fashion. She helped us greatly navigate some issues we had with scheduling and we always felt that she was working with us to help make this as stress-free as possible.My nurse was nice. She always remembered to call and give me clear instructions on medications or what my hormone levels were. Samantha was a great nurse!  She knew that I was a teacher and unable to answer phone calls during the day, so she made sure to leave me detailed messages every time she called or e-mailed.  If I e-mailed her a question, she always responded within the day, mostly within just a couple of minutes.  She described everything in very clear detail, so I never had any confusion on medications or dosages.  If I couldn't speak to her until a certain time of day, she made sure that she was free to speak to me at that time.  Once we got a positive pregnancy test, she was excited to tell us the good news and seems excited to see pictures of our baby once he's born (she also wanted to see pictures from our gender reveal party).  It made me feel like I was her only patient.Danielle was an excellent communicator. She worked with my wacky schedule as a teacher, and if for some reason we were unable to actually talk on the phone, she left me detailed voice messages with clear instructions for medicine and explanations of my lab results. We were able to communicate primarily by phone, but also at times through e-mail. Communication was mostly through voicemail  She was always quick to return any phone calls. She always left detailed messages of treatments and blood work/ultrasound appointments. The RMA staff in general are phenomenal.  Always pleasant and compassionate.  Always called me back with results on a timely fashion. Always felt like I was in good hands even when primary nurse was out of the office.  The best thing that worked for me is the ability to reach the nurse via email when needed.Christine was absolutely  adorable! Always very responsive and attend to my questions. Very good at following up with my Doctor on all my needs. She would always explain very well all the things I needed to know about medicationa or tests and schedule.. very nice approach and mellow personality. Joyce was our nurse and called me with all my follow up information. She was also very helpful with any questions that we had, and was always quick to respond to messages.Jackie was always on top of it. Returned our calls relatively quickly. Only fall back was she was out of the office quite a bit during our cycle, but there was always another nurse available who got back to me almost immediately if I needed anything:). I still email and call
Josephine with updates! I send baby pics and ask her to forward our updates to Dr. Drews. The whole staff is amazing there. You go there enough and you end up really getting to know them! Alana was my primary nurse, and Ann Marie was my primary nurse for my last cycle only. Both were wonderful, smart, compassionate and quick to respond to questions and needs. I was assigned a ""personal nurse"" but this was really not the case.  She was my primary nurse, however, my nurse was really whoever was on call for that day.  She was very clear with instructions for injections and such, but there were times when I felt that she ""dropped the ball"" on me when she would catch me by surprise with the plan of care - and I had not realized it would be so.  It was hard to process that things weren't exactly clear.  But she did remedy these ""surprises"" well and would explain the reasoning to me.  There were times though that I felt she was rushed and I had considered asking for a different nurse, but I didn't know if that would really change anything.SHE GAVE ME HER PHONE NUMBER AND EMAIL ADDRESS THE FIRST DAY.
SHE TOLD ME ABOUT AN IN HOUSE NUTRITIONIST, YOGA PROGRAM, ACUPUNCTURISTS, HEALTH DAYS THEY WERE OFFERING , ETC, My nurse was awful.  When I would get a negative beta she would joke that I could now have a cocktail and eat soft cheese.  she was so insensitive! 
She also forgot to schedule my last cycle (the one that finally resulted in my daughter).  I was livid! 
If I go back to RMA I will definitely request a different nurse.  The entire staff at RMA is wonderful. The nurses and staff are compassionate. We had Danielle Crochery first who was good and knowledgeable but didn't make the experience feel personal.  When Danielle left to further her education, we were switched to Adrienne.  This wasn't a match from the start.  She was condescending and unclear in her directions and then would become annoyed when we would ask for clarification.  We requested a change and ended up with Dayna Browning, who was wonderful!  She was organized and personable.  We never felt like a number with her.  Hoping she'll still be there when we return for a sibling!Adrienne is the total package - meticulous, patient, compassionate. She is rooting for you. I honestly don't know how I would have survived this last leg of my ivf journey without her.Ann Marie was generally excellent in her response time and communicating with us and was always extremely caring and kind.  There was a period where she seemed to be going through some personal issues and she was not as on top of responding or putting in orders that we had expected.  Still, she was always warm and went out of her way to make our experience as wonderful as possible that we would highly recommend herCarolyn was fabulous.  Very attentive and kind.  She was consistent and always communicated important issues.  She welcomed calls/questions and responded promptly.I had some trouble with the nurse I was assigned to. I think she was pretty new but I received some misinformation from her and there were a couple of times when medication wasn't called into the pharmacy for me which was very frustrating since everything is so time sensitive. However, I'm not sure if this was her fault because I think someone else does the actual calling for prescriptions.Carolyn Collins is amazing. She helped me so much through the process both with explaining medical aspects as well as with amazing compassion, grace and humor. I spoke with her often and just like Dr. Forman, Ms. Collins was truly invested in making our experience as comfortable as possible as well as making our goal of having a child a priority. As I was monitoring in Brooklyn, I did not actually meet Ms. Collins until the week before our transfer. I decided that had to meet her, so we went out of our way and headed to Basking Ridge. We were thrilled to meet one another. I felt like I was finally meeting a close friend. I am still in touch with Ms. Collins as I update them on the progress of my pregnancy. It is like sharing news with a family member.Rhonda is fantastic. But I do feel like I'm told things on a limited, need-to-know basis. Like I'm only given information for the very next step, but have little understanding of long term plans for treatment unless I ask explicitly.Rhonda was great. Wished she would be more organized when leaving me messages on the phone. Usually felt like she was trying to multitask when we were speaking but she did communicate all the information thoroughly.We were not pleased with the day-to-day communication by the nursing staff. They followed a ""playbook,"" so to speak. Calls were made at a certain time each day with results, usually at the end of the day. If the call was missed there was no way to reach them again until the next day or hope that they were checking the portal overnight. When calls were answered and we had questions, nine times out of 10 they could not be answered. Essentially results were simply read off, not interpreted or used to modify a course of treatment.Friendly but to the point.   Very detailed and knowledgeable. Always got contacted me right away, I never had to call her for the information.  Bridget was a great. Always returned phone calls within a timely manner. Christine Helbo is an incredible nurse.  She is an expert in her field.  She is consistent, clearly explained the process of meds (which is confusing at first), she is on top of things 24/7!  I am still grateful I had her as my nurse, and attribute her positive qualities and mindset to helping us achieve success.  I spoken to Alana almost every time over the course of three years.  Any question I had, silly or not, she would email or call immediately.  She still to this day loves seeing photos of our kids and seeing us on our visits.My assigned nurse was always prompt, giving me the results and action steps on time. She would call me and also send me an email. I like the fact that we communicated often by email.Originally I had Roohi, who was nice, but my care was switched to Alana when Roohi left RMA.  Alana was great.  She was organized and on top of things.  She helped me make decisions about what to tell my pharmacist, etc. Monica was my nurse and then she left the clinic and was replaced by Joyce. It was a smooth transition from one to another. Both were available and responsive to questions. Everyone was fantastic. Any person we had to get in touch with aka the nurse, Financial department, the front desk... Everyone was great!Rhonda was always honest with me, answered all my questions, and showed she cared about me.  Christine is the best!  Always friendly and very informative on the phone when giving instructions for medications or course of treatment. Never felt rushed when speaking with her. Our nurse was very organized and I know she worked with many patients. Never once did she mess up anything protocol wise and always gave daily updates when I was seen. Sometimes I struggled with her. I had lots of questions and sometimes I felt as if I was an annoyance. I think to be a nurse in this field takes a great deal of compassion and understanding and this she lacked at times. She always got back to me, but just always seemed tired. disorganised, unclear, meds not called into mail order pharmacy - many times had to rush to local specialty and pay far more because they messed up).  more than one cycle had to be cancelled because the meds could not be received in time.  a disaster.

Each time we changed nurses, it would take months to get up to speed again.  It's not calculus and rocket science!

One nurse, upon hearing that I was both traveling and had woken up gasping for air and could barely breathe suggested I keep taking the meds that caused the reaction and come in at noon.  I had clearly articulated that I was 11 hours away and could not breathe.  I had to page the on call 5 times before getting a nurse (no dr!) to tell us what to do.  meanwhile, we're panicked in a hotel.  that was horrible, horrible experience.  I can't say enough good things about Michelle.  She was extremely good at communicating the results from my monitoring appointments and providing me with instructions for my medications.  Michelle was never bothered when I called her to ask follow up questions on the protocol and she was happy to explain what each medication was for.  Michelle consoled me when I was feeling really down over yet another failed cycle.  She gave me hope that each cycle we tried could be *the* one.  Michelle always found a way to be positive.  When I left her messages, Michelle got back to me in a very timely manner - sometimes even after hours!  I always felt like Michelle had my back and was honestly sad when I graduated from the clinic that she was no longer my go-to person.  I'll never have the connection I had with Michelle or that attention she gave me from another medical professional.  It was a little jarring in fact when I transferred to a regular OB and didn't get as much feedback about the pregnancy!Ann Tepper was my nurse when I got pregnant with the twins...and then when I came back for my eSet with my son.  She was great, always very communicative but also very much to the point.  Jennifer was my nurse during my remaining two eSet that unfortunately let to a chemical and negative pregnancy test.  She was also compassionate and reliable.  I loved them both.I can’t remember my nurse’s name, but she was very quick to get back to me and managed my care very well. She preferred to communicate by email, which was ok by me, but I did sometimes have to wait a few hours for a response. I don’t recall her name but she was AMAZING!!! She would answer all my questions and return my calls immediately.  She was very organized and would go over all the details with me a few times until I felt comfortable and understood everything.Anne was amazing. She helped me with every step of my journey. She answered all my questions, addressed all of my concerns, and advocated for my care. Anne was always clear and on time with instructions and remained kind, calm, and positive during all treatments. She is very knowledgeable and has been in the field a long time. Anne is a true angel on earth.She was reachable throughout the day and clearly explained the process. She answered procedural questions very well and was quite supportive.My primary nurse was amazing. I loved her. Always so responsive and so smart. All the nurses on staff were amazing as well. She always kept in touch and didn't make me wait all day for blood results. She was cheerful and always made sure I had crackers and juice for my blood draws. I'm a hard stick so she tried to make me comfortable.Josephine was a stable in my treatment.  She was very responsive and helpful.  I did not find her to be a good communicator and she was rude. I do not think she is working here any more. I heard his new nurse is nice.I had a nurse coordinator. She was fantastic. She is the only one who i can communicate with, call and email etc. She is very friendly and so understanding. The nurse is your point person. Any question you have, she/he is available for you. My nurse was incredibly helpful during the processes, and having her available was invaluable.She has since retired, but I love her. When she was off, Christine Rose communicated with me, and she was great too.Daily  communication, even sometime hour communication.
When she's on duty I can expect a fast response to my email.
She address my concerns very quickly, I appreciate thatSome days my nurse would take a very long time to call me regarding my morning monitoring results and I also felt that she didn’t explain the results thoroughly with me and only volunteered information if I asked a lot of questions about it.It was clear that they were very busy but it was also clear that they work hard to show compassion.They are the best part of RMA. They are on top of things and communicate very well. She is a good communicator, however she does not show that much compassion! Great at communicating. Very responsive via email.She is quick to answer me either via phone or email depending on the urgency. Or she will get back to me to tell me she has passed my question to another department if she could not help.Julie has been organized and has communicated effectively, however, there does seem to be a bit of formality involved.The nursing staff was always kind and welcoming. They were sensitive to individuals and very supportive. Amy was a good nurse, it was just tough to reach her at times for late questions. Overall, I always felt supported.Susan was straight forward and very good at keeping us on track. She would rush through instructions causing us to call back for clarification.  We never both received the information so a lot of times things would get lost in translationMy nurse was awesome.  Always responded with emails and quickly.  She was a great connection throughout processMy nurse was rude and had no compassion for me. I was having complications and they just referred me to an ER and scheduled me for morning monitoring which was completely inappropriate. They firld the doctors calls and make it hard to get in touch with them. At one point she asked me if I was exaagerating my symptoms. I had to see my OBGYN to address the problem because my nurse would not help me although it was her responsibility. Jennifer is really well organized and on top of everything. She has been really helpful in coordinating our treatment and has been really kind and pleasant on the phone. Sara was absolutely amazing. Her and Dr. Rauch made the best team for me during my IVF process.  Sara walked me through every step in detail and helped to reassure me that everything was being done for a reason and that getting pregnant would happen. Sara would respond to my phone calls before the day ended and answer all the questions that I had.  Sara went above and beyond to help me and I am so grateful to have had her as my primary nurse.  Nicole is AMAZING. Proactive, organized, totally on top of everything. I never ever had to chase her down, which I had to do with nurses at another clinic. Couldn’t be happier with her My nurse Anne is amazing. She was proactive and always willing to get answers for me. Anytime I'd call or email her she'd return it within 20 minutes.Michelle has been our nurse through three different times trying to conceive. She is smart, kind, compassionate, available and reliable. Michelle is wonderful. Funny and kind and talked me through every step. I couldn't ask for more. Rhonda has been my nurse through all 4 cycles dating back to 2008. She is very thourough and organized. I love her! I loved working with mary ellen. I hated always having to leave a message and wait for a call back but, her VM always stated her working hours and when to exect a call back. the call backs always came the same day although at times it was frustrating to wait for the calls. mary ellen is extremely knowledgable and compassionate. there was nothing I could ask her or tell herGreat communication and readily available. Also very nice. Christine was adorable,  and very on top of things. She really showed that she cared. Working with Joyve was great.  She made phone calls, didn't just answer through e mails.  She took the time to help get medications through before a holiday weekened, when insurance was dragging thier feet.  She also was awesome when it came to working around my early ours when we needed to chat over the phone.Joyce was very helpful during this process to give treatment plan and guidance through appointments.I felt that the primary nurse was cold and unfriendly. I would have preferred the option to switch nurses. She was not great at getting back to me and she was not very sensitive. I am quite sure that she is no longer there though. Anne was amazing. Very caring, determined to make this work, detailed, and tough when you needed to keep your cool. When we didn't get pregnant on the first try, she simply said, ok this will happen just don't stress & call me back when you get your period. And although some people may think what the hell, she simply put me in the state of mind that not everyone gets pregnant the first time they try regardless of the circumstances, but we keep at it. She kept me hopeful and with a fighting mind. Domenica held my hand throughout the entire donor egg process.  She calmed me down when I was a nervous wreck and she celebrated the milestones with me.  Domenica promptly responded to all of my requests (Even emailed me back on New Year's Eve)!  She was compassionate and reassuring throughout the entire process. Dana is very prompt at returning my emails or calls. She's friendly and patient. My nurse s fairly short with me and only communicates as required.Nursing staff was good and professional.My nurse was ok. More procedure and hard to connect with. But nice and reasonably responsive. She was always great at getting back to me. Sometimes failed to provide me with results of bloodwork, husbands seaman analysis, but I never felt like it was detrimental to relationship with her. We are just getting started with Kelly, so we have yet to see.  Not overly communicative so far though.My nurse was wonderful. She communicated with me basically every day and always answered all my questions. I would say my first and second nurse (Megan and Brianna) was very sweet and nice and helpful but I cant say the same for my last nurse Jessica and the on call nurses. They were not helpful at all. One of the reasons I did want to go there anymore. very upbeat nice warm just a little less then the dr. she was on the button & run to the next pt. wich i did not feel by the dr. but overall verry good Jen reached out to me multiple times after my miscarriage to make sure I was okay even though the conception was natural and not a result of a fertility treatment. She is knowledgeable, compassionate and receptive.Jenn is very quick at getting back to me, is very compassionate and is on top of everything.She was my therapist and nurse. She was so amazing. I felt so comfortable with her and always felt she was upfront and honest but also compassionate. I love her! She told me information I did not want to know and I was very upset.Very, very helpful.
Answered all questions as they came up.
Sensitive to my situation.
Our nurse and the staff at RMA were excellent. She was always available and returned all calls quickly. She was easy to talk to and explained everything fullyall calls felt rushedSamantha is great at answering any questions and not making you feel like it’s a silly question. She has helped calm my nerves many times. My nurse often called to provide information, results, and instructions but I preferred the information emailed to me. She did not usually provide specific numbers but told me things looked good. She was my point of contact during an emergency after an IUI procedure. She was helpful, calming, and reviewed everything with me patiently.The nursing staff is overall good and professional. I have no complaints. GreatMy first nurse Melissa Silva was with me through the iui. She was so kind and compassionate and attentive. I'm now working with Ann Marie Luft and the third party team and she has also been a great nurse through this process Very caring and explained everything I can’t speak highly enough of all of the nurses I saw and spoke too, everyone of them was kind, compassionate, but didn’t make you feel bad for being in our situation Nurses communication was key at this office. Callbacks werecompleted daily.. questions were answered daily..  and concerns were forwarded to the attending doctor or your primary doctor. My. Ursewas wonderfulSheila was very helpful and supportive. I felt that she was empathic in our journey All were nice and knowledgeable.She always got back to me explained whatever I need help with and seemed to care about my well being and outcome.She was timely with calling us with instructions and updates. She got back to us if we left a message, once even after the hours she works. The office also has an emergency line and an on call doctor will call you back. didnt feel she always explained everything in detail seemed like I had to ask questions to get answers on some things that should have been explained thoroughly to me without having to ask. 
Mary was a great communicator, she liasones my treatment plan and if any questions or concerns she was prompt to answer my questions and if not she referred me to
The right people to help me.Lynette is great always calls with news and updates. Very thorough and gave a lot of info to us and do regular check ins with us. I loved Joyce! She was always there and never once forgot to return a call.  She is also very caring about each of her patients and their outcomes Maryellen Matthews was the best! She was always only a phone call away. Maryellen is experienced, caring and practical. She was always clear with the doctor's instructions and aways helped me with the medications, for instance, where to buy the medication with different pharmacies to get a better price, and she also instructed me how to take the meds and when to take them. She would answer the same questions a thousand times if I needed without hesitation. My nurse called daily with results and protocols. She was knowledgeable about procedures and protocol, however did not instill much hope in the process as I went through. She did not coddle or come off warm and understanding which was difficult for me, especially when I was losing hope. I felt as though when I asked questions or called back I was being annoying even though she said I wasn’t. I felt anxious when I had questions for the type of response or tone I would receive and eventually avoided answering calls so I could just hear my protocols on voicemail and speak to Dr. Fischer instead who was extremely positive and encouraging throughout this difficult process. Alana was awesome! I was with her during 2 of my pregnancies. She always answered me back very quickly. I asked a lot of questions throughout and she was always very patient and responsive. Having the nurse to reach out to was amazing. Called promptly with all results, was a little delayed with call backs (but I know I am not the only patient, just impatient when I have questions). Was able to answer questions or find answersEveryone in the entire office is friendly, nurturing, understanding and they clearly communicate with you every detail. The follow up to my million emails and questions have been outstanding.She was very patient and understanding. Even when I’m crying on the phone or feeling frustrated. Extremely supportive and very thorough with directions I could not recommend Marya Slater and the rest of the nursing staff more!  All were easy to get in touch with and communicate with.  They understood any concerns I had and conveyed useful solutions.  All were positive!  Jaclyn was great! Always available and to the point ",9.10000000000001,9.10000000000001,"Extremely quick to communicate, went out of her way for us as I sometimes need more information to get the right medication in my home country, very supportive and always explained everything in detail which we wanted to knowMaryellen was an incredible asset to our care at RMANJ. She would call me back with results, instructions and next steps in a timely manner. On days when she was out of office, the person covering would always reach out in a timely manner as well. Eve was a light through this dark process. She was very friendly, knowledgeable, understanding, organized, prompt and thorough. I am very grateful to have had Amy as my nurse,Very responsive I had to follow up at times to get a full explanation of what to expect for upcoming treatment because directions that were given confused me. She was patient with me and ensured I knew who to speak with if she would be out of the office. My nurse did answer some questions if I called the clinic and she would call me back with the answer usually within a day. when I would contact the clinic about having specific forms filled out I felt like I got the run around and one time we missed getting the forms to the Baby Quest grant people in time because of a miscommunication with either the nursing staff or the doctorDayna is thorough and compassionate she has coordinated my care so far and gets back to all of my questions by end of day. No matter how many questions I had she was always patient and honest. Lauren Bizub was great, very understanding through all our ups and downs. I was petrified of giving myself injections and didn't feel comfortable learning from a video; She offered me to come to the office and she showed me how to give myself the injections. She was very organized and would go over all the details with me a few times until I felt comfortable and understood everything. I felt that the primary nurse was cold and unfriendly. The nursing staff is overall good and professional."
59,RMA of New Jersey,clinic,"I couldn't imagine having been on this journey with anyone other than Dr. Werner and the entire team at RMA. Each professional handled our circumstance with the utmost compassion, genuinely taking interest in making our dream of conceiving a reality. I always felt truly heard, understood and that my best interest was at the core of each decision and progression. I will forever be grateful for Dr. Werner, Samantha, and the whole RMA-Eatontown team.When I was a patient at IVF NJ, the nurses were absolutely wonderful. I'm a nurse myself and I was really impressed with the job they did. They were professional but personable, on top of everything, and responded to an email, phone call or text within minutes. They made my two failed cycles easier to deal with and my successful one even more exciting and special. 
Once the clinics merged, the nurses began to leave. The nurses from RMA were ok but they weren't on top of things at all. Like I didn't realize I needed my annual mammography when I started my last cycle. They didn't even notice. IVF NJ wouldn't have allowed me to cycle. It took a long time for them to respond to email or messages. Sometimes not until the next day. Any procedure done at IVF NJ was made as pleasant as possible. The nurses, the RE's and the support staff were all really nice and your nurse would come to see you before your transfer. We even received a card after our first transfer from our nurse. 
Large clinic with a very good lab and very professional staff; but also lead for me to feeling more anonymous as there are changing doctors doing the monitoring, retrieval, etc. All the nurses were always extremely helpful and compassionateRMA is large and can feel a little like a factory, but finding the right doctor and nurse makes all the difference. We are able to get a call back within the same day almost all the time during regular working hours.Very friendly and clean atmosphere.  All the facilities are great! Everyone at RMA Eatontown is knowledge and kind. They are always there to answer any questions you might have. Everyone makes you feel comfortable when you are going through the different phases of fertility treatments and they are just as excited for you as your friends and family are when those treatments are successful! The entire process can be very draining and you can spend a lot of time at the clinic, so the staff become part of your family. I have found RMANJ to be extremely organized and efficient. Wait times for appointments are very reasonable and the care from all personnel has been outstanding. I would strongly recommend care here to anyone dealing with infertility. RMA has many locations and many practitioners.  I find this to be very convenient.  It feels like they have this down and they know what they are doing.  I don’t mind feeling a bit like a number of it works.Strengths: Almost every member of RMA's staff that I have encountered are super friendly and knowledgeable. They are a well-oiled machine and able to get you started on your treatment plan quickly. Weakness: They are a very large practice and you won't always see your primary doctor at every visit. The morning monitoring hours are great and usually move quickly but there were a couple times when I had to wait 20+ minutes for an ultrasound.Overall the experience with RMA was not satisfactory and at times unpleasant. When my first cycle with them failed (an FET with embryos from a prior cycle at IVF NJ) the nurse implied that the embryos weren't up to RMA's standards. Ok.. I have twin girls and my baby boy from those crappy embryos. I'm considering cycling again with them next fall only because of Dr Treiser. I'm already dreading dealing with them again. (RMA)
The billing department was fine. We've paid OOP for everything so the billing department was always nice to us, lol! 
The clinic is extremely busy during monitoring hours but they do a great job handling all of the appointments. Everyone is very friendly. RMA was amazing. Every person there from the secretaries, phlembotomists, nurses and attending doctors were amazing. They were always friendly and willing to listen to you. My only issue was with a fellow who had horrible bedside manner when I went for my first ultrasound when I was 4-5 weeks along. She couldn't find the yolk sac and was extremely blunt and uncaring when explaining to me that I could have a miscarriage. It made me uncomfortable and extremely scared. What I did appreciate was when I went back for my next ultrasound it was written in my chart that an attending doctor (dr forman) had to be the one doing my ultrasound. The clinic is large and I did need to call different people such as billing at different parts.  Which was a negative at some points. But the larger clinic in billing areas meant I always got someone on the phone when I called who was ready to talk about my case. 
Also since I went to the individual office it felt close and familiar, always seeing the same staff for monitoring hours. They have everything down to an exact science and the clinic is very well run. I was extremely happy with them.You definitely will feel like a number when you go in for blood draws at RMA. I found the nurses and phlembotomists at the Basking Ridge location to be much kinder. When you do the early morning blood draws, it also moves pretty quickly. I would highly recommend seeing Dr. Forman in Morristown and then going out to Basking Ridge for any other needs. The clinic was excellent. Always running on timeThey do a really good job moving everyone through efficiently. I always went right when they opened so there wasn't much wait. All in all RMANJ was amazing to work with. The only issue that I did have sometimes was when my nurse had the day off, I sometimes wouldn't receive a call with results which caused me to email Dr. Molinaro myself to find out the results. Even though there are a lot of doctors and you will see a lot of them they are all very good at what they do. Every doctor at rmanj that you see treat you as a human and not just a number. No matter what doctor you choose each one will do their best to help you achieve your goal.Very efficient monitoring process, first come first serve, but almost no waiting times as there are always several nurses for bloodwork and mostly more than one doctor doing ultrasound in several rooms, a bit of a wait toward the end of the monitoring hour time slotEveryone on the staff is very friendly and compassionate and accommodating .
I have reached out to them when I wasn’t able to get in touch with my nurse or wanted to speak with the doctor. They have always helped me in within the limits possible The nursing staff changed often and sometimes seemed a little disorganized but I overall had a positive experience.Clinic is good especially morning monitoring is very helpful as we can plan for office accordingly.
We loved the basking ridge clinic a lot . Feels like homeI think this clinic is expensive but get great result. The must be a way to help people who doesn't have money somehow, not true financial loan only. That aspect is very important. But it's a great clinic,good staffVery friendly and knowledgeable.  Great team.
They were a bit like a bus station waiting room but everyone was kind and compassionate and I didn't feel like just a number.The clinic is very organized. The wait times were minimal and the hours are fantastic. Busy clinic not necessarily strength or weakness.RMA is very professional. There are many options/ facilities for monitoring to accommodate busy schedules. I was always informed of what was going on and what to expect. They answered all of my questions and made me feel part of the process.When I made the appointment with this clinic I thought the doctor would be the one who does all of my monitoring which I have not seen him since I started the cycle.  This cycle with injectable medications I only had one follicle I told him that next cycle I would like to increase my dose but he said that he will not do that in fear of multiples even though we are willing to take the risk.  Not sure how to evaluate the outcome as I'm still in my 2ww.  Positive thing about the clinic is that they do back-to-back iui's which increases the chances...
This practice is large, but they are top of the line.  I was always impressed with the care we received from each area of the office.  Also, check out their SART data- extremely impressive!  There are also many offices to visit in the NJ area.The nursing staff was not memorable.  I saw a different one each time and had very limited interaction with them.You do see other doctors for your morning monitoring.  I had a great experience and met some great doctors. I found everyone very helpful and followed up on any questions I may of had.  Even the finance dept outlined everything out for me.  I had a great experience at RMANJ.  I would recommended them to anyone.RMANJ is definately one of the best fertility clinics in the US, the whole organization is working pretty efficient and professional, the clinic is very nice and clean and most importantly their suceessful rate is one of the highest. However I think maybe becuase there are so many patients so there is not much customization treatment for individual patient. Also I was quite surprised to find RMANJ does not have a patient portal.The clinic was very organized and always called me to go over next steps. They have a finance department along with on call staff. The only thing I did not like was their method of putting you in touch with the doctor. When the doctor called me, it always came in on an unknown number and if I missed the call, I’d have to dial the nurse or receptionist and hopefully get them to transfer me to my doctor. It was only a problem if dr Rauch called me on her day off and was unreachable after missing her voicemail. Other than that, the clinic was great. They are extremely organized nice and efficient. The staff is so friendly and they remember each patient.  The only downside is during morning monitoring the people by the front desk who are not nurses can get a little loud when they’re talking about their daily things like what they did the night before etc.  Patients  there that early in the morning want it to be quiet. It’s a sensitive situation so loud laughing and talking isn’t appropriate. None of us want to be there and dealing with infertility to begin with especially not at those early monitoring hours. RMA is a wonderful clinic.  I loved that I was provided with a nurse that would help me navigate my way through this journey.  That was beyond helpful.  You also have access to a patient portal where you can email your nurse, doctor and financial coordinator.   RMA from the first visit sets it up so that a member of their team is there to navigate you through each step.  This is so helpful in such an emotional process.  RMA has morning monitoring hours that made it so easy to receive treatment without having to take off of work too often and still getting to work in time!  Clinic is nice the front desk staff I feel are too chatty especially about other patients information when people are in the waiting room and they whisper and act inappropriately sometimes it’s very uncomfortable and awkward especially when you’re waiting a while to be seen. 

Clinic is set up nice reminds me of a bee hive very big and spacious I love the hours and flexibility because working full time makes it difficult to schedule bloodwork and monitoring appointments in the middle of the day.  Also, the ability go to other locations for bloodwork and monitoring was fantastic because I work about an hour away from our primary office location.  Being able to go to another office that was 10 min from my job made it so easy to stop before work, especially during the cycles that required very frequent appointments.Huge practice which has everything needed for a successful cycle at their fingertips.  My husband felt comfortable with them when it came to anything sperm related and I felt comfortable with all practitioners I encountered as well.  In the morning for monitoring hours it does get a little busy closer to the end and they do their best to push everyone through in a timely matter while also spending the appropriate time to explain ultrasound findings.  In a very sensitive and taboo procedure like fertility treatment, they make you feel human.My assigned nurse was very compassionate.  When she was in the office, she was very conscientious. We were pretty upset when she didn't let us know she'd be out of the office during the beginning of my monitoring appointments. The quality of communication between nursing and my partner and myself is extremely important because we have been monitoring from a different state. We had a nearly canceled cycle at our last clinic because nursing staff and local monitoring clinic did not share vital information about my follicle numbers and growth.  We wanted to be sure this didn't occur with RMA and our nurse assured us she'd be available to receive photographs sent by us in an email attachment on our first day of monitoring.  After we voiced our concerns, the entire staff responded accordingly.  Dr. Hong herself agreed to view the attachments--we had no problem communicating with her throughout our monitoring cycle.Every staff member at RMANJ that I have come in contact with from the receptionists to the nurses to the financial coordinator have been fantastic to deal with. Smiles in the morning, friendly conversations, and personal attention throughout our journey will always be remembered. It is a large practice, but each person on the team always treated us with care and compassion. Strengths:
- Excellent team of doctors and nurses. Every single doctor I met was extremely efficient and also friendly.
- Excellent embryology lab, this is a critical factor in their success rates.
- Short wait times for monitoring, I was in and out in about 15-30 minutes.
A few weaknesses that I would like to point out are the following:

1. Lack of a patient portal. Any and all information I got regarding bloodwork, test results, medications, etc were conveyed to me by my nurse. 

2. ""Morning Monitoring"" hours stink. Maybe they could extend them an hour or two?

3. No one tells you any information regarding your cycle more than one appointment in advance. I understand that everything is subject to change based on your body and where you are in your cycle, but I would have appreciated a more defined plan and explanation of what to expect. Unless I specifically asked, no one offered this information. (Sometimes, that was a good thing. Ignorance is bliss!)

A few things I'd like to point out that I think made my time with RMA great:

1. KIND and CARING staff. There is no substitute for the kindness the staff showed. There was always a little breakfast or coffee out in the mornings for patients. Staff knew me by my first name. They showed a genuine interest in my life. 

2. Amazing doctors. All the doctors (whether I liked them or not) were very smart. Any of them at any given time could answer any question that you have, whether they were your primary doctor or not. They also made a great effort to learn your chart and your cycle so they could communicate well with you regarding your treatment plans. 

3. Clean, updated offices. This was huge for me.

4. Great support system. The Fertilitalk network is great and I felt really special when I learned that Fertilitalk holds gatherings for women to get together and meet peers, and it's compliments of RMA.  You saw different people different nurses different doctors every time you went in but working full time made it difficult to schedule things. This clinic turned out to be the right situation for us because we could always get a early morning appointments before heading to work even though I only saw Dr. Kim I handful of timesStrengths: 
Their stats are strong for our demographic. They seem to have the latest technologies and some of the best surgeons on the team. They are great with phone, email, and in-person communication. We never need to wait more than 10 minutes during morning checkups. They have multiple offices making it convenient for our work commute. We haven't had a poor experience with a doctor yet and we've seen at least 5 of them.
Weaknesses: Some may feel it's too large. It's several doctors and several offices. However, the relationship we built with Dr. Doherty and the nurse (Marissa) make it feel like a small practice where we get a lot of attention.The morning monitoring staff, whether it be the front desk, phlebotomists, or techs, were always warm and friendly, even at the opening hour of 5:30 a.m.  The clinic operates like a well-oiled machine.  Each and every employee I've had contact with was professional, friendly, and very knowledgeable in their position.  I've also attended nutrition meetings and a donor-egg seminar through RMA, as they have so much else to offer, to those who are struggling to conceive. Monitoring hours are very busy especially during weekends but RMA does a great job at handling all appointments. The monitoring hours at the Morristown office were even extended by one hour to accommodate availability as patients are trying to get to work afterwards. This is another way that RMA shows how dedicated they are to their patients. I have been nothing but happy with them.  Their wait times are excellent - during morning bloodwork I'm normally in and out in less than ten minutes.  I've never had to wait more than 15 minutes.  Their lab is top notch.  They don't check on embryos until day 5, which can be nerve wracking, but it is better for the embryos to not be disturbed.  The whole team is very professional.Some of the nurses were better than others. One nurse in particular made a huge difference for me. Her name was Susan L. And she was a blessing. IVFNJ is now merged with RMA, so the nursing staff is completely different now. I thought RMA of Basking Ridge was fantastic, state-of-the-art facility, no complaints at all.RMA is a well-oiled machine. They are punctual, professional and do their best to make this process as comfortable for the patient as possible. They have various departments to cover all of your needs. You are immediately assigned to a doctor, a nurse and a finance counselor to help you along this journey.
Strengths: Communication, Organization, Success Rates, Doctor always completes ultrasound. Everyone was always friendly. The phlebotomists were excellent, always drew blood painlessly and quickly. 

Weaknesses: Very busy, long wait times for morning monitoring The staff at RMA of New Jersey is very pleasant to deal with. Early morning monitoring can get pretty busy on certain days, so best to come as early as possible to avoid long lines. The finance department was very accommodating. When I asked if I go monitor at an outside location that was more convenient for more, they agreed to work an arrangement with the other facility. The RMA Springfield office is brand new and a hidden gem. The staff is fabulous and the office is usually empty so the wait is never that long. I was so happy when they opened last year since it’s so close to my home. I would recommend this location highly. The clinic was very clean, efficient and all the employees were kind. There were no long wait times and results were communicated quickly. It was open 365 days of the year to ensure that cycles and treatments were going well and the patient is receiving what they need. The hours allowed me to work and do the treatments/bloodwork. P RMA is a big clinic, so it’s easy to get a little lost.  Always ask questions and get to know everyone who you see, for monitoring or procedures.  Knowing who everyone is helped me navigate better and be a better advocate for myself.  And don’t feel bad ‘pestering’ them for answers, that’s their job.Always felt very comfortable with the nurses! They always answered my crazy questions!They have a great lab, they are very big with many locations but you have to travel to basking ridge for major procedures. They are not on the autoimmune bandwagon yet. They are very organized and experienced in their financial department and medical department.  They are on top of all necessary forms and are always making sure their patients are up to date on what they need to sign.Strengths: There are well established protocols for fertility treatment, easy for patients to follow. All the doctors are well trained, there is no need to see the same doctor at every visit for routine procedure.Go to the Basking Ridge office for monitoring. Much more civil of an experience. Very early monitoring hours with many different offices. You sign in and wait your turn. Usually the wait time was not long. I never felt rushed during my exams.They were professional. It was an efficient, well-oiled machine but there is always a line. Monitoring hours start at 5:45 -- which is very convenient -- but you need to be the first to arrive or wait until after 7 a.m.I love RMA Freehold. It's so quiet, we are in and out every time! I love Terry, at the front desk 😘 She always has a kind word and a smile, even at 5 in the morning! We are so lucky to have such an amazing team working with us to help us reach our goal! The phlebotomists are also so amazing! They do their job quickly and painlessly! You guys are the best!!!So incredibly organized and well run!!! Companionate and amazing all around! Blood work was always quick. Email and phone calls on off hours were answered or returned at ALLLL hours. Their morning monitoring hours allowed me to get to work by 7:30 every am. Morning hours for monitoring that didn’t interfere with my work schedule were great. You see a lot of different doctors, which can be hard for some but is understandable. Financial team is hit or miss. Some members are great others aren’t great. Hard to get an appt with a specific doctor sometimes. The volume of patients was large but they tried hard to keep it moving for blood and sonograms. You have to go to Baskin Ridge on the weekends, which is a hike from Bergen County. The wait time on the weekends was manageable and they also did a good job of getting you in quickly. The doctors are great, the employees are great. Everything was very clean, organized, and well thought out. Morning monitoring hours could be done a little better. Sometimes waits could be a little long but no matter what day you had to come in, they made it easily available. They are very organize which I loved. Monitory days are fast and orders are ready and you’re out of there quick- especially if you work. Staff were very nice and greets you in the early mornings. Lab staff were on time and docs were on time as well. 
RMA has amazing facilities at multiple locations, and state of the art equipment. We got to benefit from a new screening device. And the holistic therapies offered (like yoga, acupuncture, etc.), demonstrate that they understand fertility and health, and stress management, are all intertwined. Very comfortable space. Smaller than some other clinics I went to prior.I felt less like a number. However, this clinic was not RMA when I went. They were still IVF-NJ. I am not sure how this clinic is operating today.We never had an issue with the nurses. They treated our surrogate very well, even though she didn't have a single nurse she communicated with. It is a machine. Everything is done the same for every person and it's not until something goes awry that a protocol is changed or re examined. Advocate for yourself and make sure all items are checked off the list before proceeding with expensive procedures. Financial department is a little difficult to work with-sometimes for varying messages-but otherwise no complaints. The Marlton office is small and everyone there is great. It’s very personalized care.Everyone is extremely kind, thoughtful and encouraging. every person you speak or interact with are a pleasure to deal with. Place is welcoming, neat, clean and quiet.I was very happy that we chose RMA.  I did see another clinic and am so happy I ended up at RMAEarly monitoring appointments. Many locations and doctors. Nurses emailed, very responsive . Good live birth rates. Thorough testing. Would recommend. Friendly staff. Easy to get appointments. From when I called to egg retrieval it was less than 2 months.Morning monitoring was slow. I think that Rmanj is like a well oiled machine, and had total trust in them. I appreciated their experience and compassion even when my cycle did not work as we had hoped. They can be a little disorganized and I had to reach out sometimes to remind tvem of what I needed, but I didn’t mind and felt in control of my treatment.Morning monitoring is never fun, but it was efficient. Blood draws were done first, then ultrasounds. A little cattle call - ish, but at least it kept the process moving.Really crowded on weekends - 90+ min wait even just for bloodwork. Weekdays better but you have to go really early.The earlier, the better. I found that getting there earlier, I was seen quicker and out pretty fast. The waiting room was never super full, though, and I never waited long regardless. Everyone is so nice.  They all make you feel comfortable.  Facility is very clean. Never any problems with anyone. Never had any scheduling problem.   Always a pleasant experience.  They all care about you and it shows.  You do not feel like just another number.  Monitoring hours are good with little wait times for ultrasound They were great start to finish. I wish my actual procedure could have been done closer to me ( my office was in West Orange but IUI and genetic counseling was further away in Basking Ridge)always kind & patient. Always answered questions. Even the girls behind the desk were always kind They were always pleasant, understanding and efficient. Also respected the right for privacy.  Like I said, the staff is amazing and Dr. Molinaro is just as great. This whole process is stressful but they help to make it flow as easily as possible. I would 100000% recommend them to another couple going through infertility. Great technology and team.  Facilities are fantastic and cutting edge.  Always be your own advocate, but trust them.  They have good experience and knowledge.  Proximity to house is a huge plus, but they also have other locations that are close too.
Well oiled machine.  In and out in a timely manorThey tried to be as quick as possible but it is really busy so often there was a wait time.
They were nice & comfortingThis is the poshest clinic I've ever been to - very large space, fresh fruits and water, lots of seating in the waiting room.
On the flip side - I feel that they're too driven by their success numbers. Be wary of any clinic that advertises higher than national average numbers! There's a high chance they're juicing those numbers through selecting their patients, or pushing their patients towards certain treatment options (such as donor eggs). I've heard this comment from multiple RMA patients as well.RMANJ has the best lab in the country.  Having healthy embryos is going to give you your best shot at a viable pregnancy and no one screens them better than RMANJ.  They want to give you your very best chance.Monitoring appointments were available during a window of time, which was convenient for my work schedule.  The office I visited was always extremely kind, caring, and on time.  I felt like I was seen quickly by all staff members.The front desk staff was not polite or understanding at all.  They were actually rude to a patient that I was in the waiting room with.  The billing staff didn't like questions and the whole front office staff was difficult to deal with.Clean, scientific, and efficient. They are open early and consider that women going through treatment work.  its not hard to schedule and the staff is polite and empathetic and respectful in terms of privacy and emotions.  Very professional and very good care. RMA is the best in South Jersey! I have seen other fertility clinics that did not take the time that RMA took to build our family. RMA was always available to answer my questions and keep me informed of what the next steps would be. I always felt comfortable and was never rushed out.This clinic is very expensive, it's easy to access even by public transportation, you don't lost time when you go for blood text, I believe they are good in term of result but I think they may have a program that help financially according to each patient financial capacity. Big practice, so all services in house, but had to drive to Baskin ridge on weekends and holidays. Nice abd attentive stafd. Much better than main office, where nurses are too busy. It was fine. Good location and ambianceWe loved our experience at RMA in Basking Ridge! the whole staff was knowledgeable, organized, and runs like a well oiled machine. I never waited more than 30 minutes during morning monitoring. Finance was great with handling all claims and having us understand our benefits prior to treatments.They see A LOT of patients. I left a Dr. with a small warm and familial practice, but we had limited results. Its borderline impossible to create that atmosphere when seeing so many people, but they do well all things considered. 

With my first baby, I saw many doctors for monitoring. Its discouraging to have a doctor introduce themselves or say ""nice to meet you,"" when they did and internal exam on you the week before,  but just don't remember. 
Things were different with this pregnancy. I saw my own Dr. at every appointment, which made me feel like a person instead of a number. 
That being said, I wouldn't have the opportunity to comment on my first or second ""successful pregnancy"" had I not changed to this office. There is no doubt in my mind that I would have spent my life childless if it weren't for RMA. I love the way this clinic is organized. Having a nurse assigned to you is a big plus. While RMA is big they make you feel so welcome and that they are truly invested in the success of your treatment.Very accessible and professional, kind staff, some options for financing treatments. Team of specialized doctor and it’s own labs. Surgeries, transfers and retrievals are done in RMANJ Clinic in Morristown, NJ. We attended RMA's Marlton clinic, which is in a brand new building. It's highly efficient and exceptionally clean. The staff are the utmost professionals. I was usually seen within about 5-10 minutes of arriving, which made visiting before work all the more convenient. At the time of treatment, the retrieval and transfer were done at the RMA Basking Ridge office, which is also high-tech and professional. You can tell RMA NJ stays up to date on the latest technologies, but still has a personalized feel. Strengths: great hours, informed and professional staff, quick turn around, efficient prescription logistics, overall cleanliness and comfort. I felt like everyone knew me and my situation. I felt heard and supportive. Because of the size of the practice, you may not see your reproductive endocrinologist for morning monitoring or have them during your procedures. There is a schedule on their website that outlines what doctor is on what day. It all depends on your timing. Mornitoring experience was very good, I was able to in and out within 20 minsOverall the building and office is very nice. The staff were courteous and welcoming. Scheduling was easy and flexible. My visit was efficient and ran smoothly. All of the tests were conducted as they said they would be and we didn't run into any problems.  Strengths - they’re very good sales people and the look and cleanliness of the facility. 
Weakness - compassion, organization, doctors availability. The fact that you will not likely see the same doctor twice in one cycle. It feels like a revolving door and you are on your own.  No general information about what to do to have a successful cycle. Lack of explanation - they make you feel as if they don’t want to tell you much about what happened or they try to keep you in the dark - or they simply can’t answer you.  Strength - They supposedly have a good lab. Their facility is impressive and the OR setting is nice and well equipped. I would try to plan/hope my procedures are during the week. The weekday nursing staff in their OR is much more professional than the weekend staff. Office visits are fast and efficient. They deal with such high volume that they have pretty good processes in place for 
funneling patients through on a daily basis.
Weaknesses - You're a number. Neither physicians nor nursing staff will take genuine interest in you as an individual. That means your care protocol will come from one of a few predesignated buckets, unless you push for more. You will NEVER have access to your doctor directly. You will always have to speak to a nurse or set an appointment if you have a concern that you would like to speak to your doctor about. If you want someone to actually care about you as an individual this is likely not the clinic to go to.One strength RMA has is that it’s organized. Some weaknesses of RMA is that other doctors will perform some of the services. You may not see your assigned doctor at all. Be your own advocate. Also, RMA does not have a patient portal. Although your nurse or other nurses, if your nurse is out, will contact you and let you know your results from monitoring, they won’t give you a print out of your results. The only way to get your medical records is by requesting a copy of your medical records and then paying for each page up to the max $50.Strengths: morning monitoring hours to accommodate working people, advanced technology, very organized, very flexible  
Weaknesses- not being able to find out embryo until a week after retrieval
I suggest getting to monitoring right when they open, otherwise you’ll wait an hour or 2 to be seen. The clinic feels like a well oiled machine. They are organized and quick with their processes. They also offer additional resources like counseling and  support groups. I was able to get a free counseling session as a patient and they referred me to a great counselor close to my apartment.It was efficient and well oiled machine. Never had to wait more than 20 mins even with a line of women in front of me. RMANJ is the best of the best. Their labs and techniques are the top in the world. I trust everyone on the team thoroughly. The biggest shock was how many people are at morning monitoring. At first, I felt like a number but once I kept going back, I got really comfortable and got to know the staff well. RMA is a well organized machine. Everyone I’ve dealt with has been exceedingly professional, friendly, and warm — from nurses, to phlebotomists, to coordinators. 
The facilities are also really nice — like, unexpectedly so!
I especially appreciate how responsive and open the finance team is — they provided us with a print out of ALL the financial information we could possibly need upon our consultation, and we got to speak with a friendly and knowledgeable representative a few days after our consultation. She’s been responsive via phone and email, and always explains everything in detail.They are supposedly one of the highest rated clinics with the most pregnancies and highest babies born. My one and only surviving embryo didn't make it to transfer. So I can't comment on that. The monitoring hours were from 6am to 8am to accommodate working schedules. I start at 6:50am so sometimes it was a little tight for me but they were always pretty fast first thing in the morning. Advocate for yourself with billing and your nurse. I feel like things could have been missed if I didn’t speak up to my nurse. Doctors are very thorough and perform the ultrasounds every morning bright and early,  I switched between the Freehold and Eatontown office so that I could have Dr. Molinaro as many mornings as possible.  About twice I had other doctors. So that was comforting to have my doctor looking at my ultrasound and not just a technician to get to ask him little questions and a feel for things each day and then wait on bloodwork for final instructions later that day from nurse. They are very organized and I don’t have any comments on weaknesses because I can’t think of any. Only advice I would give is to get there early on mornings you have to go in for lab work and/or ultrasounds. It’s walk in only and the hours are 5:45-7:30 and by 5:45 there are usually at least 15 people already there. Get there closer to 5:30 unless you have plenty of time. RMANJ has Lots of locations, caring and understanding staff, high live birth success rate. Would love if all locations had weekend hours, but we were able to make all of our appointments within reason. They are very open with information and data. The finance department is probably the weakest department, not as sensitive to the large sum of money, ask you to do a lot of calls to your own insurance.Monitoring hours are early morning and it’s first come first serve. The wait can be long at times but generally it’s before a holiday weekend or a Friday. Only once I had a pa do my ultrasound and she didn’t know what she was doing and I cried on the table in pain (during stims for retrieval) the doctor had to redo the test. From then on I made a point to tell them only a doctor can go near me. The staff was understanding and never sent that pa in again. Overall, we were very happy with the clinic. Although there were a few very nice lab techs, there were also a few that were not. I usually tried to make light of the situation, as early morning appointments are not always fun, and I am not a fan of needles. In making said conversations with the lab techs, some of their demeanors expressed as though they were not interested in engaging in conversation, or that their statements were ""forced."" Since we suspended our treatments however, RMA has moved to a new and much larger facility. Having said that, they may have more lab techs now which would allow patients to engage with a more diverse amount of employees.Everyone was very nice and explained things extensively.  We got all the paperwork we needed. Everyone we came in contact with was compassionate and make sure we understood everything we needed to. We barely had a wait and were back with the doctor almost immediately. This is a big clinic but I still felt like I was followed by my primary team and only saw different doctors than my primary doctor while at monitoring appointments. It was fairly easy to get an appointment and each step was coordinated well. This is a well-oiled machine. Everything is really efficient from the nursing team, to the financial coordinator to the staff on the day of your egg retrieval/transfer. You can tell that they work really hard at understanding the process so they can get people through and do things right.

I'd love to have some sort of patient portal to view all my bloodwork but can see where that make some patients crazy. I love that I get a call from my nurse within 3-4 hours of doing bloodwork and know exactly what's next for my protocol.The clinic is definitely a baby making machine, so it is very regimented.  I enjoy the process however it is not for everyone.  I think there could be a bit more explanations during procedures and some more time spent with patients.  It seems as if the phlebotomists are all very different and not all care for the patient and it is shown by how they draw the blood.  RMA is a big organization and each department has their own responsibilities.  My doctor and nurse communicate well and are on the same page.  The finance department seems to be stretched too thin.  It takes them a long time to reply to billing questions yet when you have to pay up front for a cycle they have a sense of urgency.  The finance department lacks compassion and understanding of what the patients are going through.  I  would require special training for all finance or anyone for that matter who talks to patients.  RMA should also invest is bringing on more support for the Finance department.
Visiting the Freehold RMA clinic has become part of my daily routine. The staff are amazing and make you feel comfortable. They try to get you in and out of the office as quickly as possible and listen to all of your needs. RMA has a large set of resources available due to it's size but then sometimes appointments can be hard to get and you may have to travel a distance for some treatments depending on how close you live to the main center. They have very educated and capable staff but I often found it difficult to get someone directly on the phone.The clinic is well organized and the front desk staff are warm and friendly. They are a well oiled machine. They always return phone calls promptly. Christina is in the finance department and she was very helpful and thorough.The clinic was well organized and clearly thought of the patient when designing the space. The wait room was huge, so even though there was always a lot of people there, you really didn't feel like cattle (as I've heard other clinics feel like) and it's comfortable with reasonable wait times. Everyone was really nice. After having experienced treatment at two of the top fertility clinics on my home state, I could tell that the quality of care of RMANJ was much better. They are a large practice but I never felt like a number. They were very well organized and wait times for monitoring appointments were rarely long. As part of a treatment cycle I interacted with different doctors/nurses and it all seemed very well coordinated. 
In my case the rate of embryos making it to day 5 was also much better than at other clinics - a testament to the quality of the lab and lab staff. 
They are one of the top fertility research centers in the world and it shows on their success rates.I'd be lying if I said morning monitoring wasn't dreadful, ughhhh. Even if you get there as early as 5:30, you can still be waiting for an hour+. For how big of a clinic RMA is, you really do receive individualized care and I think they do a great job of not making anyone feel like just a number. It can be intimidating looking for a fertility clinic in the beginning, especially going in blindly. I think utilizing a place like RMA and their expertise would give anyone the best shot at success. Each department was very professional as well- different departments always called when they said they would.Everyone at the clinic is amazing. The receptionist girls are great, very friendly, always remember you by your first name. Early monitoring employees are also so nice. You begin to establish a friendly relationship with everyone which is nice. I can't comment on any weaknesses of the clinic. Sometimes the monitoring are quick sometimes it takes longer. The clinic gets very busy especially in the morning. Weakness: In the morning for monitoring, patients sit in the hallway lined up outside the door of the clinic - it's sad/uncomfortable seeing these women sitting in a dimly light hallway on the FLOOR.  The Englewood NJ office does not to retrievals/transfers, so patients have to travel to southern NJ for those procedures.
Strengths: I found it relatively easy to get in touch with Dr Chu and her staff when I had questions. They answer emails quickly.Strengths are that everyone is kind and compassionate and they really feel bad for you and want to help. Weaknesses are the financial department as they messed a few things up and my doctor and nurse had to help us figure it out. Monitoring hours were so convinent and really helped because I did not have to miss work or go in late.  RMA is amazing at what they do.  Yes, it gets crowded (especially on weekends and holidays), but that's because they are the best.  I saw a variety of doctors and nurses for morning monitoring, but after awhile of being there you interact with the same people enough that it becomes comfortable.  I had my favorite ""blood girl"" and the front desk receptionist knew my name without signing in.  The level of information and speed of procedures, scheduling, finance, etc. always amazed me. I felt that during the waiting period while I was trying to lose weight, I fell off their radar.   Even the nurse stopped following up with any frequency after a while. I had to cancel a nutritionist appt because I was sick and then I never heard back from her even though I had reached out.It is a very large clinic so morning monitoring is very crowded. However, the doctors and staff are professional and know what they are doing.  Getting to morning monitoring very early is crucial if you want to get in and out in a timely fashion. I showed up 25 min before the office opened and still would be waiting in a line for the doors to open. RMA is huge so you can, esp. during morning monitoring very much feel like just a number there.  On the other hand, they have an on site lab so if you go to the main office you can get monitoring results earlier in the day (before 10am) and their monitoring starts at 6am and is open on weekends.That you have to be at your appointments before 7:30am, with some flexibility. They are very thorough with blood work and examinations on a weekly basis. I did have a phlebotomist hit a nerve while tying to draw blood. Overall, the staff was friendly and nice to be around.The clinic is very efficient and runs very well.  Even with many people in the office, monitoring hours always went smoothly.  The office is very clean and is employed with many sweet professionals who genuinely care about outcomes.RMA NJ has many satellite locations, which makes it easier to get to.  The main location in Basking Ridge is beautiful and the rooms are very private, which is nice.   They offer complementary protocols, like acupuncture, during the transfer, which makes it easier.  The waiting times can be long if it's a busy morning, though if you get there really early, you can avoid that.  They have great success rates and will work with you to make it financially feasible.The clinic's monitoring hours were convenient. The clinic functions like a well oiled machine in terms of the process. Completing the diagnostic test, egg retrieval and transfer.  They assigned modules before the egg retrieval that would have been helpful to review while completing the diagnostic tests so that i had a better sense of what would happen next and that could have helped me figure out more questions to ask in regards to my care. There isn't a holistic approach. They do not ask about supplements and so I don't know if taking or not taking supplements impacted by results. They did not give me enough time to search for an affordable pharmacy which meant I used a recommended pharmacy.  Glen Rock pharmacy is not managed well and not professional and and it caused a lot of added stress. In addition, I felt the same way about GeneScreen for genetic counseling. For a professional and renowned institution one would think they were have more professional partners/affiliations .Strengths - Essentially it's a one stop shop for almost anything you need as part of your fertility treatment. I even had an outpatient surgery (hysteroscopy and polyp removal) under RMA and the care I experienced was excellent. I was very impressed with the high level of coordination between departments and the communication and responsiveness - everything from medical and nursing consultations to finance to embryology. It was a seamless experience for me as the patient, which is not always easy to come by!

Weaknesses - I always had to drive to Basking Ridge for blood work/monitoring on the weekends. Also when having ultrasound monitoring in Basking Ridge on the weekends, I never knew which doctor I would be seeing and that experience was a bit too cold and 'assembly line' for me...I appreciate that they have a long line of patients to monitor each morning, but the doctors need to also appreciate that fertility patients aren't just a number. We need a little extra TLC at each interaction, after all we are having a probe stuck up our vagina (!!) and worried about every step of the way in trying have a baby. One doctor in particular - Ashley Tiegs (I believe she was a Fellow) - was very cold, literally in and out, blurting out some information, never even made eye contact with me. That was the one and only truly negative experience that I ever had at RMA.The clinic was awesome I have no negative things to say, the facility was beautiful the staff was always friendly and there hours were tremendously accommodating. We could get early appointments so our treatments never effected our work life. Friendly, pleasant, personable. All staff is friendly and accommodating. RMA of NJ, Marlton sets a very high bar, they make every other clinic experience I have had look poor by comparison. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------RMA is the best in NJ.  They have the best birth rates and I know three people who have beautiful babies because of their care.

RMA can feel like a cattle call.  I do not find monitoring hours to be convenient since I still must travel a ways regardless of location.  The AM time frames are exhaustingly early and strict.  There is no wiggle room in their schedule because they see so many patients in a day.  Just know you’ll be there 3+ times a week before dawn, and there will still be a line.  I’m getting used to it though.RMA-NJ's greatest strength is that they are successful. At the end of the day this should be the number one factor in choosing a fertility clinic. But as you peel back the onion you realize that they are successful because they are uniquely strong in so many areas. 

Some strengths: 
- Excellent at communication (via phone and email)
- Centralized records that the medical team can access so that information is shared
- Innovative: They conduct research and trials so they are always pushing for innovation and new approaches, 
- Convenient: They have a lot of locations in NJ and you can monitor at any of them
- Flexible: This is so important if you are out of state, like we were. They will work with you and make the process seamless
- Excellent doctors 
- Competent, knowledgeable, and organized nurses
- CCS/PGS lab in house (they donated the CCS lab that they developed to a non-profit and it's located at their headquarters)
- Highly skilled embryologists 

Minor weaknesses:
- I don't love their email system but this is a problem with many clinics. It worked out ok for us though. 
- There isn't an online portal to get results information and I like to have all the information during my cycles so that I can follow along. My nurses were happy to provide this to me though. I wouldn't want to trade interaction with my doctors and nurses for a portal, though. It is a good clinic with great doctors and nurses. Sometimes you do feel a little rushed because of the amount of people that have to be seen during morning monitoring. I feel it would help if they had more doctors and nurses on during that time to ensure quality of care and that questions can be answered by the doctor that is seeing you at that time. Overall, they work hard to get the job done.Monitoring hours are hella early (6-7:30am) but it was nice to get it out of the way so it didn't interfere with work. Blood work is fast, but waiting for an ultrasound sometimes takes awhile. Weekend waits are VERY VERY long since only one location is open. Bring a book, it could take over an hour. It is a large operation and unfortunately this means that you don't see your doctor often. Coming from a smaller RE practice, this took some getting used to. I definitely had moments where the large scale practice was glaringly obvious. For example during monitoring I had one doctor, who hadn't reviewed my case or infertility history, see my ultrasound and comment that I was responding really well to stims and should be able to get my ""whole family in the freezer."" I knew this would not be the case based on my egg quality issue and previous IVF rounds, but she obviously did not know my history or situation. If monitoring or embryo updates fell on a weekend, usually a nurse or doctor you did not know would call you with the news, and not the nurse or doctor you are most comfortable with. Situations like this sometimes made monitoring feel impersonal, although all the doctors and nurses I came into contact with were lovely. Despite the size of the practice, I usually did not wait long for monitoring and always felt like I could reach out to my nurse or doctor if I needed personal attention.Strengths - The physicians and nursing staff are great, and smart. I trust the strategy and processes they have chosen for my treatment. 
Weaknesses - They are busy, so sometimes you feel as though you are just going through the motions, but all in all, after you have to have blood drawn so many times, that becomes tedious too. :)
I would recommend RMA!
RMA is VERY expensive, but are the best in the area so after a lot of soul searching - I decided I would figure out a way to have an RMA baby.  I would recommend sitting down with a financial coordinator and having everything priced out for you so there are no surprises!It was very clean and never had to wait too long to get in for blood work.  It was very supportive and nice that the provided treats on Saturday mornings.  The people at the desk were helpful and I formativeVery organized, very clean, very nice. One downside is billing/finance. I found them very hard to contact and a few times my calls went u answered. The staff that does morning monitoring is always happy even that early in the morning. Know that you can place/insert the ultrasound wand yourself if that is more comfortable for you. You are the one in control of your body and if that helps you individually, the doctors are more than happy to let you place it yourself to avoid discomfort.They are a huge team that works together to help you.  They have many locations that you can go to for morning monitoring.  I had an issue after my egg retrieval and my nurse wanted me to come in and get checked out, the doctor I saw that day was very thorough and gentle during the process.  The one downfall is that on weekends all RMANJ patients have to come to the Basking Ridge location for morning monitoring which can get a little crowded.In terms of strengths, all of the doctors who take part in monitoring are capable and communicative and seem familiar with our case.  They are efficient I handling the number of cases that come in during morning hours.  Also, they advertise top of the industry results in terms of success of live birth rates.This clinic's strengths include: excellent staff (from the receptionist, lab techs, nurses, doctors and administrative staff).  The monitoring hours are excellent because it allows us to go in for monitoring before work so that we don't have to request time off.  The team at RMANJ take pride in their work and it shows.RMA makes you feel like a human, not a number. They have always been extremely responsive.

I do know they are a bit on the pricey side, but their success rates I suppose make up for it. 

IF you are unhappy with anything during your experience, speak up. This is your journey and if you are paying OOP for it, it's up to you to speak up. 

Do your research. Don't just go with the flow. Make sure you understand the protocols.Great hours, accommodating, great doctors and nurse staff, awesome people to draw blood. Friendly and considerate tot he emotional toll of this process. Helpful at answers my questions and making me feel
ComfortableI like the location because it is only about 15 minutes from home and work which to me is a positive thing especially when my husband had to take in a semen sample.  The appointments seem to run right on time.  I don't remember ever spending more than 10 minutes waiting in the waiting room.  They also have a place on site that can draw blood or test semen right away.  Another strength is that they have a nutritionist onsite several times a week too.  As a new patient you should know that the doctor and clinical staff are fantastic.
* Everyone is very responsive
* Scheduling the first appointment if you are new to infertility can be a bit
   overwhelming as the front desk staff isn't the most compassionate.
* The office is always open for morning monitoring even in inclement weather
* It's easy to get an appointmentA huge strength is how organized they are. Everyone has a job to do and they do it flawlessly, following up with everyone to ensure their treatment moves forward as quickly and seamlessly as possible.RMA has some of the best success rates around.  This is the most important strength of the clinic. They also work with out of town/state patients such as myself and accommodate my travel schedule.

The weakness would be that maybe there should be some kind of thorough orientation at the beginning of our treatment to better understand the process.  Also I think there should have been a better understanding to the fact that maybe these treatments might not work in order to have a more realistic expectation. 
The center is clean, modern and professional looking.  Everyone is friendly and personal but also respect your privacy. You must come to the practice financially prepared. Deductibles and out-of-pocket fees (except copays) is collected up front in full before any cycle is started.RMA NJ is excellent -very organized and yet still very compassionate. The best mix I have found of these 2 important qualities and I have been a patient at 3 clinics total. I think they are among the best in the world right now. They are evidence-based only , which as an MD myself I appreciate but sometimes when I feel desperate I do wish they did more experimental things a la CCRM. we travelled far from Brooklyn to RMA because of its lab success rate. Being a carrier for genetic Disease we wanted the best lab. And thank god we have baby and frozen embryos that are fragile x free. RMA was clean, professional. Never a long wait. Accommodating. Easy to deal with payment and bills. Warm staff. Extremely clean and sensitive to our needs Receptionists are friendly, though aren’t the best with protecting privacy. The clinic’s secure email system is beyond annoying. Calls are generally returned quickly but there was at least one instance where I didn’t get a call back from a covering nurse on a holiday. They won’t take or dispense excess medication and charge for nurse administration. The strength of RMANJ is it's size, they don't batch patients, tests, egg retrievals and embryo transfer occur every day of the year, due to the size of the company. The embriology lab is amazing and gets results like no other. It can appear very impersonal, it runs like a well oiled machine, but if you need constant hand holding, it may not be for you.This clinic is clean, organized, friendly, easy to access, has excellent parking, is easy to schedule, and has been an overall pleasure.

The receptionists are courteous and helpful both over the phone and in person.

The appointments are staggered well so there is no awkward or inconvenient wait times.

The nursing staff is positive, friendly, knowledgable, and outgoing.  They explain each step and ensure complete understanding of each phase of diagnosis and treatment.

The phlebotomists are capable and pleasant.  I have had multiple blood draws and never have to wait and have not had any pain or brusing from any visit.

The doctors are knowledgable and caring.  They speak to us as humans in terminology we can understand and invite questions.  They take their time with each appointment.  We never feel like a number or that we are rushed through.  We understand each stage and are looking forward to a successful conception under this team’s diligent and skilled care.The front desk is very friendly. My one criticism would be the phone system, it’s not easy to get someone on the phone. Typically you have to get a callback. You have to go through a lot of steps when you’re trying to leave a message and it always seems that you’re “in line” waiting for the next receptionist to pick up the callVery nice staff overall, efficient check in process and morning monitoring that’s long enough to get to before work. Facilities are clean and all of the doctors are made up to speed on your records before meeting with you. It could feel factory like from time to time due to the size especially when visiting the basking ridge nj office. Overall it’s a good experience and really organized.The clinic was always very clean and organized, with light music making for a relaxed atmosphere. Coffee and water were also available. I appreciated that the clinic had signs indicating that children were not allowed, as I know this could cause sadness or anxiety for RMA patients.  I was always able to check in very quickly, and never waited longer than my appointment time to be seen. Overall the clinic is professional but caring and a comfortable place for patients.  The location was not convenient considering how often I had to visit, but it was worth the extra travel.  They could not perform certain procedures at the clinic and I had to travel quite a distance to another facility on those occasions.  There will be a new office opening soon so I don't think this will be an issue anymore.Monitoring appointments were wonderful because I could go before work and not have to worry about taking time off from my job.  Additionally, they flexibility to go to multiple locations also helped me avoid missing time at work.Pros- Great statistics, know what they're doing. They also have experience with my husbands diagnosis (retrograde ejaculation) which is pretty rare. Our previous clinic did not seem to know as much.
Con- They are very large. Some call it a baby factory. However I find comfort in knowing they see a lot of different cases and can react appropriately. The atmosphere in the office is very calming and the staff makes it a top priority to make patients feel comfortable. The hours are great especially for working patients.  Labs and procedures can be done in early mornings which is wonderful. The front desk staff is super friendly, sensitive and have a great sense of humor. They are kind and patient. 

I love that the waiting room does not feel like a clinic but a comfy place to wait. 

The fictional advisor I am assigned to will explain information to me at least a 100 times and does so with all the tome in the world I know she is busy but never makes me feel rushed and only wants to help It gets very busy at monitoring hours. I would wait sometimes an hour to be seen. 
They are very efficient, organized, and communicate well. They have a large staff with their roles clearly defined. 
You are assigned a doctor, nurse and financial coordinator. You know exactly who to contact. The on call doctor are also great and respond very quickly. My clinic is great.  Some days morning monitoring takes a long time.  Everyone there is amazing.  I haven’t had a complaint about anyone so far.  Saturday and Sunday’s you have to go to basking ridge for morning monitoring. They always have juice and bagels in the lobby for you.  I have heard some doctors don’t do your retrieval and transfer.  If you are happy with your doctor I would try to request them. RMA Somerset is very organized. They have great hours and are pretty good about being flexible. They are very knowledgeable and I feel like they are just a well-oiled machine with amazing people that work there!RMA-NJ is like clockwork.
You feel like you've joined some sort of elite fitness club or something, because you can take your ""membership"" and show up at any of their offices each morning for monitoring and they know who you are and treat you like a valued participant.
I wish they would do day-3 embryo transfer, they will only transfer day 5's.   
That said, they have great PGS testing, it's CCS testing and provides a ""normal, mosaic, or abnormal"" rating.  They will allow transfer of normals and mosaics if you had PGS testing.
They have a few different financing options for folks like me who don't have insurance.
Their embryology department is amazing.  I had to have ICSI done and it worked very well.  Their frozen embryo statistics are stellar and are one of the reasons I choose RMA-NJ.
All weekday monitoring happens between 6 and 8 in the morning, weekend they are open until 10am.  I wish they had later hours.They have multiple offices and early monitoring hours which is great. But sometimes because there are so many doctors with differing approaches, results can vary from monitoring and things can be missedI liked Dr. Paul Bergh. The nurse assigned to me was very organized and you can do your lab work right on site. The monitoring is done early in the morning one day a week. I will say if you need medical records from them or sent to them leave a long time to do so. Dealing with the medical records department can take a long time. This is a large facility and it can feel as though they are a well oiled machine. I would warn people who are overweight to address that issue before attending this facility. A friend of mine's wife attended this facility with PCOS and they called her obese. PCOS however contributes to obesity from what I understand. The one area I do no care for in this place is the billing department. Before you can go in for your appointment you have to sit down with the billing department. Is this is your first round with infertillity and your husband is anything like my husband, sitting down to talk about money before your appointment seems a little obscene. Shouldn't we be talking about cost after you recommend a course of treatment? Also we were lucky to be covered by the NJ mandated IVF coverage at the time. However, they told me to be a part of the embryo donor program (using anonymous embryos) you have to pay $5,000 that is not covered by the insurance. At other facilities out of state this is the cost of a frozen embryo transfer with a donor embryo. Why so much? Isn't charging for embryos illegal in New Jersey? Someone should look into this. This bill was not itemized either. They didn't tell me what the actual reason for asking us for $5,000 were. The embryos were already made and stored. All they were doing was matching us with available donor embryo. We left for this reason because I was thoroughly annoyed by that amount and told it was because in New Jersey they charge crazy administration fees for donor embryo programs.Their strength is in their live birth rates. It’s top notch. Their strength is in their client/patient services. They always make you feel welcome and secure while you are there, right down to the person who draws your blood. You’re always met with smiles and courtesies. I love that clinic so much. RMA is a huge practice (and let's be honest, it's a big business, too) - you'll definitely sit in waiting rooms with dozens of other couples and realize you're one of a few thousand patients they see every year. That said, the size of the practice gave me lots of confidence that each procedure I underwent would follow best practices. I also felt confident that even if my primary doctor did not perform every procedure, I was in the hands of another highly qualified doctor. I was consistently impressed by the quality of care of nursing, reception, counseling, and financial support staff across multiple offices. And last but certainly not least, I'm impressed by everything I've learned about the quality of RMA's lab and the research that comes out of the practice. I felt like everything about my care was state-of-the-art, best-in-class, and holistic. Even though it's a large practice, I think they go through a lot of effort to consider the patient experience, though I think there are small things they could improve in this regard - like providing more info on your full care team (either on the website or as a packet of info when you first start care), streamlining the educational resources they provide, and/or creating a phone system that's a bit easier to navigate.I used the Freehold and Eatontown offices for monitoring and honestly have no complaints. Every time was simple and thorough. The staff become more like family to you since you see them so much, or at least that was my experience. The day my positive beta came in, everyone in the office was thrilled for us. It really was great to have all the support from not only your doctor and nurse but every member of the office. Big, clean professional outfit.  You could have any of the doctors do your monitoring, retrieval or transfer so don’t get too attached to anyone. The monitoring appointments were hit or miss.  You could wait a very long time at times. Sometimes stand on a long line and stand ina crowded waiting room. They are strict about payment.  They will not give you any instruction until your account shows it’s been paid.  No exceptions.  RMA is great. I actually have sent a friend there since I graduated, and I know several people who have successfully had babies at RMA, some after years of infertility with no success at other clinics. They are a large practice so you do see a lot of doctors, but all of the doctors at the Somerset office and the ones I met at Basking Ridge were all great. I especially loved Dr. Leo Doherty. He was kind and compassionate and has hands down the best bedside manner of any doctor I’ve ever met in my 29 years of life. The office staff is incredible, the nurses are all kind, and I LOVED the phlebotomist Richmond at Somerset. I was really sad to graduate. My OBGYN is great but the experience doesnt hold a candle to the one I had at RMA. I would recommend them over and over to anyone (and I do!) Clinic is a well oiled machine. We went to Basking Ridge office where Dr. Hong is primarily situated.  The waiting room is very elegantly adorned and comfortable. Although we did not get to enjoy it!  We did not wait at all for our monitoring appointments. From start to finish, our appointments were 15 minutes long!  It was quite remarkable how efficient the staff was as a whole.  Always remembering detailed information about both of us.  Very, very impressive. :-)

The hospital room where I had my retrieval was quite sterile and impersonal. Only a bed sheet separated my partner and myself from other women who had their procedures at the same time.I monitored at a different RMA NJ location due to convenience. It's nice to have the option of monitoring somewhere closer to home yet still being followed by your doctor. However, sometimes there is a really long wait during monitoring hours. Could be 15 min to over an hour. Because RMANJ is so large and has so many locations, you'd think you'd feel as if you were just 'taking a number' when going to appointments.  I actually felt the opposite.  Each office I visited, each phlebotomist I encountered, each doctor who saw me - everyone made me feel that I was a person with my own specific needs/questions/concerns.  I thought I would feel overwhelmed and defeated by going to such a large practice but it was incredibly convenient to have so many offices be open with very early hours for regular blood tests and ultrasounds.  I wish there was more than 1 location that was open on the weekends/holidays but other than that, I have no suggestions/complaints.RMA has a lot of patients and they are really quick during morning monitoring to get you out so you can get to work. If you wait more than 20 minutes definitely check with them. My husband and I both had to go for blood work and because we went at separate times they checked him off in the system after he left and it kicked me out so when I went and checked in at the front it didn't register in the back with the phlebotomist. That only happened once. Every other time I've been there it's never been a problem.RMANJ is easily accessible; Multiple locations and hours of operation make morning monitoring and appointment scheduling extremely easy. They offer a wide variety of services beyond fertility treatment like acupuncture, counseling, and nutrition education. RMANJ strives to treat the entire person/couple not just the infertility!Great location, great staff.  Front desk now has friendly, happy staff.  Initially had a woman who was not pleasant and this made for a negative experience.
Would like for am monitoring to have hours until 8am until just 7:30am
While this is a high volume clinic we NEVER felt like a number (we were very pleasantly surprised by this). And because this is a high volume clinic, they are very knowledgeable and experienced at what they do. They have taken the time and care to create an environment that is warm and comforting for what can be a very draining and grueling process. It was a well-oiled machine and did not interfere with work or my day. I really like RMANJ. You will not see your doctor at most morning monitoring sessions or procedures, but they manage your care. The team works together well to give good care and everyone I encounter seem to have reviewed my chart and be able to answer my questions.It is a very big place with a large staff, but they also take the time to communicate so well!  If you have a question or a concern, and your nurse or care team member does not answer, you really can just leave a message and they will respond quickly.  They understand how much their patients have riding on their testing and treatment and are all very compassionate to your need to get the information promptly and ease your mind.  My husband maybe felt a bit intimidated walking into the facility, but the waiting area is expansive, beautiful, well-decorated, and that somehow made me feel more at home, despite how nerve-wracking facing treatment can be.Have paper next to you with questions written down when expecting calls or directions.   This process can be overwhelming, but know this clinic is amazing and the staff is fantastic. RMA has been described as a baby factory, but I think I have been in their care for so long (18 months) that they are like family to me.  I think selecting your doctor and nursing team is the best approach so do your homework beforehand as to what doctor you would like to care for you.  Even if it means waiting 4 months for an appointment, it is so worth it.  RMA is an amazing clinic where yiu are treated as more than just a number. All staff is very knowledgeable and caring. They work with your specific needs and have convenient operating hours for full-time working patients. Regular daytime appointments went smoothly and the receptionists are always friendly and nice asking about your day, etc.  the issue with this specific site is the waiting room and monitor waiting room is. It big enough.  It is packed to the brim most mornings I went and sometimes I had no place to sit down.  Also the wait time can be 1 hour at least maybe longer depending on how many people show up and what time you come.  I stopped going and went to basking ridge instead where it was 15 minutes for blood work and ultrasound with a big waiting room and more staffing.  At the first place they only had 1 doctor to do the ultrasounds.  In addition to the staff, which I think I've already covered sufficiently, the location is great for me, and the monitoring hours mean that I haven't had to miss work at all for monitoring sessions or IUIs.RMA is a large clinic. There are a lot of doctors and facilities. It can be overwhelming, but I highly recommend them. They know what they are doing!Strengths: reputation, multiple offices, resources
Weaknesses: patients go to them, so they don't need to focus much on patients, the money is coming to them regardlessThe reception staff is friendly and helpful. I can't say enough about how great the phlebotomy staff is - they work quickly and efficiently and are wonderful to talk to. I do think, however, that the Somerset office could benefit from having more than one doctor on morning monitoring. I often feel like that is the part where I wait the longest to get done, though the monitoring itself is a fairly short process.When your doctor layout the plans for you. Do some homework and understand 100% of each treatment and purpose of them, if not clear at any point, email your doctor or nurse for better explanation. Phone call might be difficult to reach them, but doctor and nurse are better with email conversation. RMA was a great clinic.  Wait times were minimal for morning monitoring - I think the longest I ever waited was 20 minutes.  Phlebotomists were friendly and pleasant and always referred to me by name.  I had a positive experience with RMA and can't point out any weaknesses.RMA Morristown was pretty good.  One thing I feel the need to comment time is that on any given day during morning monitoring hours,  The waiting room which is right across from the front desk, can be very full. There are tons of women and their husbands sitting there very anxious or maybe having just received bad news and just trying to get through the process. Meanwhile at the desk, other patients are being congratulated and given their discharge packet. It’s really difficult to have to sit there and listen to someone else getting the news we truly wish you were getting yourself. I did eventually get that news myself and I was sure to keep quiet and hurry out of the office. I just feel maybe the office staff there needs to be a little more sensitive to all of the women in the waiting room.Monitoring was very efficient. I went to Basking ridge location for most of my monitoring. The clinic hours are great, I have been in and out of the office in 5 minutes with very little wait time. It's easy to get to, is clean and friendly staff. The coffee...not so great though...bring your own! Great clinic with latest technology.  It is big with a high volume but I would rather deal with crowds somewhere where I am confident I am getting treated by the best doctors and nurses than in a smaller place with substandard care.  RMA is the best!I didn't find monitoring hours to be convenient, especially on weekends. There were only a few rare occasions that I was in the office for more than 30 minutes. The weekend office was about 20 minutes from me so we always budgeted an hour and a half just for bloodwork & ultrasound appointments. That being said, I think that the staff did the best they could and everyone was very organized.  Drinks would be the flexibility. I was still working full-time in New York when I had to go through treatments so while some people may not like the fact they see the same doctor or staff every time they come in it was a strength for me since I didn't ever have to worry about getting an appointment for blood workRMA is a smooth running practice. They see alot of patients so it's easy to feel as though you're just a number, but the staff goes out of their way to make sure this doesn't happen. It can be overwhelming at times when you're in a packed room at 6am waiting for monitoring, but I feel as though that's a testament to RMA's great reputation. The financial advisor I had the first time around was awful, but the second time around, I had someone else who was great. Like anything, there are a few bad apples but overall this is not the norm here.Great doctors! Some nurses great! They should teach all patients in person how to administer the injections. Luckily my first nurse was kind enough to show me the subcutaneous injections. The muscular injections my general doctor and mother showed my husband how to do them. The main strength of RMA is the size. There are many offices that you can go to for your bloodwork and ultrasounds. The office hours cannot be beat. The Morristown office opened even earlier to accommodate their clients. Despite the number of patients RMA treats, we still felt like we got personal care. Morning monitoring waits can be long if you don't get there at 5:30am.Monitoring hours are extremely fair.  I usually arrived at the very start of the morning, and on some days I would not have to wait at all, while other days I've waited over 30 minutes.  Patients seem to be flexible, as this tends to be the norm with open monitoring hours.  It really depended on the day- if everyone had the same idea to show up at 5:30 a.m., then there'd be a wait.  The staff certainly hustled and did the best they could to get all patients cycled through in a timely fashion.I really had a wonderful experience.  I do believe however the importance of simple acts since as smiling when a patient is being greeted by any staff memeber.  Some of the front office and back office staff I encountered for morning monitoring was just plain terrible.  I have been working in the medical field for 16 years and I've always smiled and greeted my patients as if they were the biggest priority I had at the given moment.  Some of these ladies not so much.  All of the process is grueling and emotionally as well as physically draining.  The least the staff can offer is a compassionate smile.Strengths - nice facility and very clean. Staff was always so friendly and helpful. I have been to 3 of their locations, and they were very nice and organized. Always open and available in some capacity at any time. Central computer system makes it easy with multiple offices. I always appreciated the ""no kids"" policy. They acknowledge it's a very sensitive topic for people struggling with infertility, and that really stood out to us. The offices ran like a well-oiled machine - everyone knew what they were doing and everything was seamless. I never felt like a number even though at times, morning monitoring could get busy.

Weaknesses - just wish morning monitoring hours went a tad later (30 minutes later) to fit better with my work schedule. I loved RMA. Even though they are a big practice, they still treat everyone with the care that patients want. You feels so welcomed when you walk into any office and the staff smiles at you and is very friendly. Going to monitoring often you get to know the staff and build relationships and it makes it enjoyable to wake up early to go there.RMA of Eatontown is a very good office.  The staff is all very friendly, including the phlebotomists (even at 6am), and they remember who you are.  Even though I didn't see my primary doctor during all of my morning monitoring, all of the doctors I did see were great and explained things to me.
My only complaint was once I was released.  I had to pick up a folder of information from the front desk and the receptionist loudly congratulated me on being pregnant and released and wished me good luck, in front of a whole waiting room of women.  As happy as I was, I was embarrassed when she spoke so loudly.  I remember one morning while I was waiting for monitoring and she did the same to another woman; I remember being so jealous and wondering why she didn't keep her voice down.RMA treats patients as individuals, not as numbers. During my treatment, RMA opened beginning at 5:30 for morning monitoring instead of 6:00, which was wonderful as I did not feel rushed getting to work in the mornings. I highly recommend you arrive a few minutes before 5:30 so that you could be one of the first for blood work and ultrasound. This way, you do not need to worry about getting to work on time. The office staff was always pleasant. The phlebotomists were quick, personable, and painless. The staff worked to make each morning as pleasant of an experience as possible, and seemed to value the time of each patient. I honestly cannot think of any weaknesses- the whole operation is comprised of miracle workers :) The clinic is extremely organized. Sometimes I had to go to Basking Ridge and Morristown, each facility was well maintained and the staff were extremely friendly at both places.RMA is the best place I've been to.  I've been to many clinics in the U.S. and overseas.  There is no place like RMA.  Out of all the places I went to I only saw results at RMA.  The staff is extremely friendly and the doctors are very knowledgeable.  Always felt like I was in good hands.
I love the RMA atmosphere.  It is very important to feel comfortable in the office and the exam room while you are going thru the process and RMA definitely made me feel comfortable and importantWhile I have to say overall my experience with this clunic was positive, I cant miss to point out a big issue: the financial team..I'm sorry but very mediocre.  I had 3 different financial coordinators of which only 1 was excelent and she left RMA, which I almost cried when I found out. The the other one I got was pretty much useless. They really need to work on this area. The financial burden adds a lot of stress to the process and I dont think they have the most qualified financial profesionals, neither they are very caring for the patients. Again I only had one that seemed to care for me. I had one that actually kind of insulted me once.
Other than that, complementary care is great! I have been doing acupuncture witb Marc Passman and he is absolutely adorable and knowledgeable about all fertility topics so he has made the process really greay for me. I really appreciat his care also!They have their process down pat, and yes, you do feel like cattle some days. But everyone is very nice and they try to get you in and out of the doctor's office as fast as possible for you (especially regarding morning monitoring). Even though you do not see your specific doctor every morning (during morning monitoring) each doctor was very nice and was able to answer any questions that we had. Clinic weaknesses- feels like a factory because it is so busy.
Strengths- they know what they are doing and every single person on the staff is engaged- polite, caring and on top of it! I call RMA the baby making factory. It's filled with the top rated doctors in the infertility field. I'm so glad we chose RMA. I did look elsewhere but no one else compares!Morning monitoring is between 6-7:30 on weekdays (until 10 on weekends).  I never had to wait more than a few minutes.  They understand that you have to go to work and get you in and out quickly and efficiently, while still feeling cared for.Excellent reputation because they know what they are doing! Brilliant doctors and scientists, well organized and executed in every aspect. The size of the clinic and clientele can be overwhelming. Especially Basking Ridge. The clinic was clean and comfortable.  In terms of Morning Monitoring, a staff member gave me a helpful tip to arrive 10 min before opening in order to beat the morning rush.  I would arrive at 5:45am and wait for the doors to open at 6 so that I would be one of the first 5 patients of the day.  I was in and out between blood work and ultrasounds in under 30 min (sometimes even 20 min.)  If you show up at 7:30, you can expect to wait around for a while due to the volume of patients coming in at that time.

The Englewood location was only for my initial consultation, morning monitoring, and meetings that I requested with my Doctor.

All other procedures were done at Basking Ridge, NJ, as well as Saturday and Sunday monitoring.IT WAS IMMACULATE! I WAS SUPER IMPRESSED. 
WAIT TIME WAS NEXT TO NOTHING.
STAFF IS FRIENDLY, AND THE OFFICE DID NOT FEEL OVERWHELMING AT ALL. 
NO PACKED WAITING ROOMS(WHERE THERE ARE NO SEATS AVAILABLE!)
PERFECT FOR ANYONE WORKING AND ON A SCHEUDLE.RMA is great.  It is a well-oiled machine.  Morning monitoring usually went quickly even when there was a lot of people waiting.  The office staff knew who I was and made me feel special.RMA is a great practice.  They have a variety of office locations with convenient monitoring hours.  If necessary you can always get in contact with someone at the office. RMA NJ is known for its high success rates and state of the art facility.  I love that all of the doctors collaborate on different cases to make sure nothing falls through the cracks. We're fortunate that we live so close, as I was floored that during my egg retrievals, there were other patients visiting from NYC and even Europe to have their procedures done there.  When I asked why they would travel all this way, the response was ""because they're the best""It runs like a well-oiled machine. Sometimes getting a call-back from people other than my nurse proved frustrating, but in the grand scheme, they were highly efficient,The facility is a beautiful, wonderful, very relaxing environment and all the staff makes you feel very welcome.  They are respectful in realizing how sensitive those undergoing infertility treatment are, and no children are allowed on the premises nor are their baby pictures plastered everywhere.  We can't really say there are any weaknesses that we encountered. RMA Basking Ridge is awesome.  Big, clean, and beautiful.The morning monitoring is definitely the biggest weakness. Even though they have a good method for people to get blood drawn and be seen by the doctor, there were many, many mornings I would be at the clinic for 1-2 hours. They did extend their morning hours by a half hour when I was doing treatment which did help a little bit.
Some mornings I would get there and there would be maybe 8 people and then the next morning at the same time there would be 25 - it was hard to plan for how long I'd be there.Strengths: doctors and nurses

Weaknesses: not enough phlebotomists. Morning monitoring is always at least a half an hour wait, even if you arrive before monitoring hours start. Also some of the phlebotomists are not great. Once I ended up with a bruise that lasted 2 weeks, at least.It feels like feast or famine. Either its super packed or its empty. Comfortable setting without any major issues. Only a fan a select few of the phlebotomists there since some of them were fairly rough when drawing blood. Staff is great overall.RMA NJ is a factory with little personalized care. We found nearly no positives with this clinic. Wait times were long for daily blood work, access to doctors was restricted, nursing staff or doctors of the moment were rarely educated in our personal journey. After two failed IUIs we were ready to move on to IVF and we knew that we could not go through that process at RMA. And thankfully we made the right choice in leaving there. We found another practice that was extremely personal, was able to modify courses of treatment when needed and monitored me closely throughout the entire journey in order to ensure a positive outcome.Location is easy to get to; right off main highway.  

Staff is very friendly and the facilities are very clean and pleasant.  

If you do not get to the office first thing you will wait a little for the bloodwork.  Monitoring hours ran like a well oiled machine. You never waited long in office unless the was an unforeseen circumstance.After our consultation at RMANJ - Morristown, with Dr. Eric Forman we knew he was the doctor for us and that RMA overall offered the leading technology, expertise and outstanding patient care that we wanted.   We choose Dr. Eric Forman specifically because of his expertise in In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) with Comprehensive Chromosome Screening during the embryo selection process and Single Embryo Transfer (SET).  I think it is important to read over the RMA website and all the data that is presented.  Dr. Forman's involvement in research and his medical background and training along with his very kind demeanor made the decision very easy for my husband and me.  During treatment we were either in the RMA Morristown office or Basking Ridge and we always had a good experience - things were consistent.  I always had a very good experience during all of the steps involved in IVF - Blood work with the technicians was fine - I was in and out.  I never waited.  All of my visits with Dr. Forman were consistent and went as scheduled.  My nurse Christine  kept us well informed and organized with our appointment schedule.  She was wonderful. The only issue I had was when my original financial coordinator switched departments.  She was fabulous!  My new one, I had to always double check with my insurance bc she was very rarely correct with the information she gave to me.The clinic was well equipped, specious and they had plenty of staff members to service you.RMA is great.  Their blood technicians were amazing.  Getting blood drawn almost daily can become painful, but they were great at getting blood, giving tips for making blood draws easier, etc.  RMA was timely and their offices are beautiful.Being a busy clinic is only a positive here. More patients, more experience, more success. The in house lab and in house testing was important as is the research the clinic is doing.  This was my second clinic and I traveled far to go to RMA. I cannot think of any weaknesses.... They are so accommodating. There would be a line to get in for early morning monitorings and they would even try to open earlier! Everything is run like a very well oiled machine! So smoothly!!!! I recommend this clinic to anyone... But make sure you get there early as possible! RMA is very well known for their work on infertility.   They have state of the art facilties, doctors, and nurses.   I felt very safe, comfortable,  and confident there. Friendly staff, quick appointments if you made sure to get there before peak times. I was seen in two of their locations for monitoring and never had an issue with anyone. RMA is a wonderful clinic. I never went to another clinic so I have nothing for comparison but my expectations were exceeded. As someone new to this experience I appreciated all the feedback you received. Everyday you were seen you would get a phone call with an update and any adjustments in your protocol. Once I was pregnant they saw me every week and I got pictures each time. I missed that tremendously once I was discharged at 8 weeks. Possibly what I loved best was that I never felt like a number! It took them 2 surgeries to do what they should have in one.  One dr pulled my stitches out by hand (not even gloves).

It's a slick facility/facilities but the treatment is barbaric and they will game their success rates by canceling your cycles.  there are better options!!The clinic is very organized.  I never had problems with missing paperwork or test results.  The front desk staff are just as invested as anyone else.  One day I walked in for an IUI and the check-in person greeted me by name and told me they were ready for me even before I signed in.  This REALLY made me not feel like a number!

The clinic is very clean and warm and inviting.  There is plenty of space in the waiting room which feels nothing like a typical doctor's office.  They are very respectful of an individual's privacy.  Both in the paperwork end of things/checking in.....and medically.  When I was at a monitoring appointment or a procedure appointment I was always treated with dignity and privacy.

While I saw a variety of different doctor's for my morning monitoring appointments, I knew they were taking detailed notes to provide my primary doctor.  This was done by dictating the results to a nurse while the ultrasound was happening as well as notes recorded on an iPad after the ultrasound.  This level of communication made me feel comfortable regardless of which doctor performed the ultrasound.RMANJ is a excellent clinic with high success rates and experienced, usually compassionate doctors that are willing to work with you to provide the best standard of care.  The office visits are very efficient.  That said, one of the downsides is probably a long wait time for initial consults and workups.  Usually a month or more out. I loved RMA! They are smart, take chances, and have an incredible lab. They are more expensive than the other clinic I went to but they got me a take home baby, so it was worth it. My husband didn’t like the monitoring mornings, because it is sort of like a factory with lines of patients going through the process one after the other. That did not bother me though. I felt like they were extremely organized in their approach and everyone was so nice, I never felt like a number even though I guess I technically was to those who were performing all the monitoring. I highly recommended RMA!  On a scale of 1 to 10, they are a 10!!  RMA and it’s entire team are hands down an amazing and compassionate group.  They are professional and make you feel comfortable during this very uncomfortable time.  RMA is a wonderful, highly organized clinic filled with amazing doctors, nurses, and personal. Everyone was always on the same page, very kind and knowledgeable. My only complaint is wait times during morning monitoring, but I took the time to relax and catch up with emails. They are fast and organized on the day to day visits...coordinating schedules while working is difficult and they were accommodative. Very clean, nice building. Felt very comfortable and safe.Their strength are all in their numbers. Looking up their SART was what made me switch fertility clinics. Possibly weaknesses might be they have taken over another fertility group and opened many more offices since I have been a patient. I am not sure if all the new offices and staff have the knowledge and compassion as the staff back when they weren’t all over NJ. I still would recommend them in a heart beat. Because of them I have my two beautiful twin girls It is completely different from when I went, so this question doesn't pertain any longer.It's a huge place, when you go to the main campus you will fill like a number but hopefully you'll appreciate that. The embryologist know what they are doing and they work really hard to make sure you get a take home baby.Monitoring was fine, no complaints at all. Hours are early in the morning but I would get in and out which minimal to moderate wait times. The earlier I got there the quicker it was.RMA is a big clinic and clearly knows what they are doing.  However, you do feel like a number during the routine monitoring.    Some of the doctors get to know you and are kind others just examine you and move onto next patient.  There strength is in there results! The support services they connect you with and offer. The testing lab on sight. Their availability and skill. 
Weaknesses: sometimes you feel like you are just on an assembly line. 
However, work it,it is worth it!Clinics strengths - they do have alot of staff. The nursing departments and blood work department are friendly and good communicator. 
(it is really hard to say).

Weaknesses - charding patients to see there doctor for 15 minutes everytime sucks! That is why we only saw her twice cause it was expensive. She's hardly at the clinic, would be nice if she was there doing her rounds and talking to her patients. The place should have windows for sunshine...extra vitamin D and provide positive moods for patients. They have one of the best labs in the country. For me, this was essential. I had plenty of eggs retrieved, but they were very poor quality, and the ability of the lab to cultivate them to day 5 was essential.

RMANJ is very large, and this bothers some people. I had no trouble with it, especially with the help of my nurse coordinator. 

The doctors are all top notch, and I found every one of them (whether doing consultations, ultrasounds, retrievals, or transfers) to be compassionate and wonderful.When you go to Basking Ridge it is overwhelming since there are so many people there. It will seem like a factory, but just know all the Drs discuss every case, so they all know your deal, but it is up to you to advocate for yourself and speak up.Clean atmosphere, welcoming. Advance technology for signing in. It could be challenging for the fist time but the staff are there to help. 

The practice is for fertility only.  I felt like everyone that came to the office is in the same journey as me. The staff at the office was very friendly and almost always efficient and running on time.  There were times though that phone consults were either delayed or missed causing me to have to reschedule them which was very inconvenient.Very large and streamlined. Don't expect a lot of personal attention and do expect to pay top dollar. Everything seemed very state-of-the-art and fairly thorough. The cattle-call feeling for testing and prep, etc. didn't bother me, but I didn't love feeling like we didn't always have access to the people who could answer our questions.Accessible, thorough and organized. I like that they have weekend hours close to my house and that almost all appointments are in one location. Though I don’t yet know my outcome they seem extremely capable Very organized! Clean! I have a big hope on the embryology result next time! I heard about lab having more that national average success rate! Was not the case on my first round, but not have a high expectation with the new protocol in the next time Very organized. A well-oiled machine. I had to get involved with the insurance a little more than expected, but the finance team came through on completing everything. The insurance still denied me coverage. I haven't tried a lot of clinics, but I feel very comfortable at RMA. Dr. Kaser is the real reason I'm here.
Morning monitoring is crazy. First come first serve early morning hours. I do like you see other doctors sometimes so its almost like a second opinion. The office is a well oiled machine so I can see how some people say it feels like a assembly line. Honestly though the time with my doctor personalizes it for me. Morning monitoring was from 5:45am-7:30am at patient convenience. It was first come, first serve. However, it would get very busy and wait times could be up to 90 minutes.Monitoring was efficient, but often a long wait. The clinic is very big which makes you feel at times like you are just a small piece in the production line, however, they are very knowledgeable and confident in their methods and research. They also do their own genetic testing and seem to be very confident in this area.RMA was my top choice. Dr Molinaro came highly recommended by my OB and personal friends. The clinic was always clean and efficient. Even with a waiting room packed with patients, I never waited too long or felt rushed through my appointment.Very organized...the process is well thought out to keep you on track...ivf is a very emotional process and no except the social worker (1 visit)plugged into the emotional aspect of it. They are well located in many areas of New Jersey they are convenient. Clinic was fairly small but I liked that i got to know everyone by first name.  They asked how i was, including the receptionist.  They start to become familiar when you’re there a lot.  They opened a new clinic in the middle of the process that was more updated and new, but with the same people.  They were organized, easy to talk toRMA is good at ehat they do but if you are a special case and it strays from their “textbook” you wont get the proper care. It is a very big company and patients tend to get lost. I felt more like a number than a human. The clinic itself is a bit of a 'hole in the wall'. It is small, but I wouldn't let this put you off. So far our paperwork has been handled well, and all of our concerns have been addressed in a very timely manner. Monitoring was every morning. Very little wait most of the times.Dr. Rauch, Sara and the RMA clinic was a place that I went to multiple times a week for almost one year. Some days I left with tears and other days I left with a huge smile on my face. But ultimately, Dr. Rauch is the reason that I have the privilege of being a mother to my daughter and I will forever have a special place in my heart for her. I loved RMA. I got personalized care and it’s a very well run clinic. I’ve heard people complain that they were treated like a number but I didn’t feel that way at all. I don’t have any weaknesses to report.RMA is extremely organized and leaders in advancements in fertility. They do studies on large scales and aren't afraid of implementing new changes. They are often at the forefront of new developments.Rmanj is amazing. The doctors and nurses are brilliant and compassionate. The receptionists are upbeat and competent. The financial advisors are wonderful advocates. The in house social worker was easy to speak with and specialized in fertility. The clinic itself doesn't close and has monitoring hours every day. There very helpful with everything from making appts to helping w finance. I became very friendly with most of the staff. I was there so much that they made me feel very welcome. They were compasonite with me thru every loss that we had. RMA is not a small place. You don't know which doctor you will see. Sometimes it can be crowded during monitoring hours and you can feel like you are in a factory. But it runs extremely smoothly!It is like cattle call in basking ridge, but it's nice in eatontown. Everyone is friendly. You have to go very early if you don't want to be waiting for a really long time.  There are generally a lot of people who go for monitoring hours at the Englewood office.RMA NJ is a leader in the latest techniques giving people the best results. I never feel like a number, I highly recommend this clinic I found rmanj to be very good at what they do. the billing team, the nursing staff and all the misc clinicians were friendly, respectful, and knowledgeable. the basking ridge location is beautiful, though in the middle of nowhere!Monitoring appointments were in early morning which seldom conflict with my work schedulePersonalized attention, great communication, and efficient care. Everyone I have encountered has been extremely nice, compassionate, and understanding. Very knowledgeable but the finance department is a mess and the worst.Quick, clean, efficient.RMA is clean, organized, available. It does feel a little like a factory when you get shuffled through morning monitoring but they accomplish the treatment plan without any setbacks for me.Everyone else (other than the nurse) that I came into contact with was so friendly and warm and sensitive in their manner and approach. RMA is a large organization and yet I still felt well taken care of. I didn’t like that I constantly saw different doctors. I know they are a team, but I saw one dr for a practice embryo transfer, and she didn’t even do the actual transfer. Out of the several doctors I saw, they were all professional but I can’t say I loved any of them. None were overly compassionate and a few actually said some insensitive things to me after a miscarriage such as, “it worked once, it’ll work again,” as if my loss wasn’t that big of a deal. I think they do care about patients but at times it felt more about the money we had to give. I know the practice has since combined with another so it may be different now.Loved everything. Convenient scheduling & lovely staff. Monitoring appointments in Hamilton were during a window of time, but patients were typically moved in and out fairly quickly.The strengths are that they offer many options for fitting into your busy schedule. Blood draws and ultrasound at different campuses and a big window to come in according to my schedule.
The weakness in my opinion is that my doctor doesn't always do my insemination. It is done by a physician but someone that I didn't knowPerfectly well oiled machine! I actually go to the Springfield location for Dr. Jurema, but also attend the Basking Ridge location. In Springfield, waits are shorter and everything runs smoothly. I have to wait a while at the basking ridge location but understand it is larger and busier due to many treatments and surgeries taking place there.The facilities were nice, clean, and had good locations throughout the state of NJ.  No weaknesses that I can think of.  The clinical areas were clean and organized.  The waiting room/reception areas were comfortable and relaxing as well.  The reception staff was organized and efficient.They do tend to do the same protocol with most patients. Few doctors will go off script from my understanding. They will not transfer mosaic typically. The positive is that they have tons of on hand research, their own lab and multiple locations/doctors tochoose from. Efficient! I was always treated well and never wasted anytime within the facility. Everything ran very smoothly. all Of the Drs I saw were informative kind. All of the office staff were also great and helpful anytime I had a question when I called or while I’m clinic. They never wasted my time. Which I really appreciated.  The lines started out the door before they opened. It was always packed but they did a good job most times of keeping it moving. Again, same as previous review as with Dr. Kim's review.  The numbers pretty much speak for themselves, as this is an experienced clinic with excellent doctors.  That said, long waits for initial consult and workup.Morning monitoring is super busy. All the doctors are good and everyone is friendly. I never really felt like a number but the mornings are always rushed. Finance department could be frustrating at times. The clinic is very good I just wish I was getting better results. The clinic needs more communications and organization skills.  I love the hours of the clinic and the staff was very nice but again certain nurses wasn't all that great.  They clinic was very clean. The on call nurses and doctor need improvement. it is a good nice clinc with a alot of good things its just mybe to big so you my feel numbered but overall very good You will see many different PAS and Drs during your monitoring. The per son doing your treatment may not be your regular dr.Can be a bit of a conveyer belt but it's quick and efficient.I had a really good experience overall. The front end staff are not that warm.  The phlebotomist were amazing.  The nurses need to remember to be compassionate!  During my second retrieval I passed out and it seemed to bother the nurses that I was still needing to be cared for during their lunch!It is very well organized, HIPPA laws strictly unforced. 
Everyone is very nice.
Much research is done.
Information available on line and easy to schedule appointments as needed We are very pleased with the level of care we received at RMA.  We chose this location after very careful consideration and research, and a poor experience at another NC clinic.The facilities are beautiful and all most all testing is done there. The moitoring hours are before work so time missed is minimizedIt's a very large practice, and it's probably possible to get lost in it if you make a wrong turn anywhere along the way. It's important to take responsibility for your care there, just in case someone drops the ball. On the flip side, because it's so large, they have access to anything you would need. business of making babies, pushed for IVF since that is most expensive route rather than fully discussing options or really looking at the source of the problem.  I went to 2 different clinics and felt the same at both, both did not want to investigate why infertility was happeningSometimes morning monitoring takes a long time. The front desk is always friendly as well as phlebotomists and other support staff. I wish they would make a the iui process slightly less conveyor belt and a little more personal. Clinic seems thorough and professional. They can take awhile to return messages and getting through to someone can take time too. Overall, my experience was ok but they were not helpful in finding me a local monitoring clinic. Efficient and fast. I was normally in and out in 15 minutes or less. excellent experience, everyone very friendly and respectful.My biggest critique would be the on call answering service. Whenever I call, I am always asked if I am pregnant, which I find absurd and hurtful. One of the on call doctors is also pretty terse/short, which is unnerving mid cycle.Efficient. Early morning Varied day to day based on which Doctor did monitoring hours. The only weakness I can see with this clinic is that there aren't many seats in the morning at the Englewood office for morning monitoring. And Even that is being addressed with a Reno right now. I love RMA NjStay on top of all your meditations and there side effects.  Recommend to doctors if something doesn't feel right.Loved our office, down side wish it was open 7 days a week. Had to travel 45 minuets to the other office on days they were closed. Which was a beautiful facility, and ultimately where I had my egg retrieval, and transfer.  They have a lot of patients but treat you like a human. They are smart & know what they’re doing. Everyone is smart & kind, empathetic & patient. It’s a tough job but they do it with a smile & with ease. I don’t remember any weaknessesThey have been in business for decades and have the knowledge and experience to treat any fertility issue  Busy... several locations... the lab tech werewonderful and very compassionate... office was organized.Very busy. Sometimes long wait times. Overall staff is friendly and supportive They are organized and knowledgeable.  Ask questions and get to know options and resources available to you!There were long waits some mornings. My retrieval and transfer were done at the main location with other doctors I had never met before as well as many monitoring appointments but I was happy with all of them and felt they were all on the same page and following the plan set by my main doctor. The clinic has ample parking and is easy to get to. The office is organized. I did this during the coronavirus pandemic, and they revised their check-in protocols to accommodate new safety measures (a little later than I would have liked but I was being hyper careful weeks before it became mainstream). They remember who I am, and are friendly. The nurses were able to find my veins!!!overall very efficient  Employees are all nice. but it can feel a little rushed at times. your in and Out They See Alot Of Patients so it's not very personal 
location and hours are convenient. the blood work and us appointments Are Early am which is convenient for people who work but for ones who dont or are Off Later hours would be niceThis clinic is very detail oriented. They let you know upfront the procedures required and what everything entails. What I liked the most is that they’re not money hungry like another clinic I had visited. The initial consultation is free which is goodStrengths very organized and have separate teams handling everything you need. Nursing staff is great as well as the medical assistants 

Weakness some times it’s crowded and have to wait for monitoring. Come with all the questions, they will answer it. They don’t push you to immediately commit to treatment, if you aren’t ready they will check in with you via the phone every few months. Very caring peopleRespectful of schedules and quickLove the clinic.  Just wish they had a room for your children for when your being monitored every morning.  I found it very difficult to find a sitter for 7am for my two year old. Besides that it’s very clean and has good ultrasound machines!RMA in Basking Ridge is amazing, it felt like home during my two years of  treatment there. The front desk were always very helpful and kind, the nurses where very skillful and caring, the exam rooms were always clean, very equipped and the ultrasound machines were all new. RMA Basking ridge has an incredible infrastructure and that gave us peace of mind giving us confidence during the procedures. RMA Basking Ridge has a great system when you go for the morning monitoring, which can get very busy. There's always a nurse in the clinic if you need as well. My only complain is that you can't call the front desk directly. RMA has a call system that transfers you to whom you need to speak with. During the weekend, if you need to speak with a nurse, you have to call the call center, try to explain your concerns to a non medical person, leave a message and the nurse would call you back. It is all very efficient, and I understand that in order to control volume they have to have a centralized system. But I wish I could also had the option to talk to the front desk especially if I had dealt with someone there with a specific issue. I also had some issues with the financial department. In the beginning we were never completely sure how much certain procedures would cost us, it wasn't as clear to us. I removed myself completely from the financial issues because I couldn't deal with my financial coordinator, I passed that ball to my husband who has a better understanding of insurance since he works with insurance. RMA seems to have lots of success and a good understanding of infertility and treatment options. I was happy with the process (as much as one can be going through infertility). I wished I could have more contact with my direct doctor but I understand that can be difficult and she was available when I requested to speak with her or I happened to come on a day she worked monitoring hours.I really liked the process at RMA. the morning hours made things a lot easier for my schedule. I never waited too long and I really liked their system for having a nurse you could reach out to with questions. Efficient, well-oiled machine. I didn't feel like it was a cattle call and I never waited more than 30 minutes. The earlier you got there the better and sometimes  I was in and out in 20 minutes for BW & US.They try to make it as convenient as possible. The office staff is kind and gentle. Staff is all friendly including the men and women who ran the bloodwork and the front desk. Everyone was smiling all the time and very welcoming. Waiting room is a little small and Tuesday morning monitoring always got backed up... otherwise they were quick and efficient!The clinic is clean and organized. The lab is quick and gentle. The doctors are all great with great bedside manners. They take the time to speak with you, answer questions, and show empathy and compassion. The only weakness is the office is on the smaller side and sometimes you have to travel to another office for monitoring if they aren’t open on the weekends.Monday’s and Friday’s are the busiest and depending on where you live if you need anything done on the weekends like I have you will have to drive 1 hr away for a 20 min appointment. Strengths are that every staff member I ever ran into dealt with was pleasant While few enjoy waking up to be at a doctor at 5:30 a.m., RMA's numerous locations made it as painless as possible.  Rarely did I have to wait more than 5-10 minutes for bloodwork and ultrasound.  Staff at the facilities were all helpful and positive.  The clinic overall was always very Clean, professional and caring. I felt like they really knew what they were doing and they were trying their best to help us reach our goals of becoming pregnant. It did take over 2 months to actually start a treatment cycle because of all the preliminary tests so I do recommend starting as soon as you can! Super efficient, minimal wait-time (5-10 minutes at most), and I was usually out within 10-15 minutes after being brought back. It was all very easy, seamless, and professional. Morning hours were well run. I never waited long. Process was efficient and well organized. The wait time and experience varied, depending on the day. Some days, it was quiet and all moved quickly. On days when they were short staffed or there was a large crowd, it went more slowly. The monitoring appointments were fine. The nursing staff and staff that took blood were lovely. 
The doctors for monitoring were different everyday. One being the one I felt very uncomfortable with. No consistency at all Monitoring is done at certain times in the morning. Everyone shows up and the office runs through  the cattle call. To be honest they are efficient and organized and it doesn't take too long. The nurses are friendly. The ultrasound may be a doctor or a PA. But it all goes quickly and efficiently.Monitoring hours are between six and 7:30 AM. I suggest getting there right at six as it does fill up quickly and it’s first come first serveThey were quick and efficient overall. There’s a lot of people there, but it’s not that bad. I was always out in less than 30 minutes. We commute in from NY, and then work in NYC — so it was a pleasant surprise that RMA had extra early monitoring hours! It didn’t mess with our schedules except that we had to leave the house earlier (it’s a 45 minute drive). 

The wait times weren’t excessive, and we generally saw the same NP for ultrasound (sometimes Dr. C was there instead!)It worked out for me because I tried to be one of the first ones there when it opened so it always went pretty quick. I went one time maybe an hour or so later and there were a lot of people there but even so didn't have to wait in the waiting room for too long.6am to 8/8:30 I believe. I stuck to earlier times (6-7) so I could get home before my husband left for work and to get my child ready for school. The waiting room in Eatontown was often very full but it did move pretty quickly; Freehold there was hardly ever a wait for ultrasound or bloodwork. Monitoring would be in the early morning hours, everyone who arrives gets seen in the order they arrive. It was never a long wait. I needed to lay down for blood draw they always put me in a room for this. Some of the monitoring doctors would be a little rushed and not explain the measurements or calculations in the sonogram The morning monitoring was super convenient. You could get in early, jump from ultrasound to bloodwork and be out the door in time for work. Most days I could get in and out in 20 minutes. I've waited as long as 45 minutes to get done, however, once you know those busy times, you can maneuver your schedule a bit to adjust. It never derailed my morning. Morning monitoring was always much earlier than I needed it to be before work. Most of the time, I had a minimal wait period in the waiting room but on occasion they got backed up.The monitoring visits were quick and easy. For the most part, it did not feel like a ""cattle call."" The wait room is big, so it doesn't feel crowded, and they kept it moving.I mostly went to Basking Ridge for monitoring and it would never take long. It was run very efficiently and the hours were very convenient. First come, first served. Monday and Friday are particularly bad days, but other times you could be in and out fairly quickly. I'd try to get there early, but sometimes it wouldn't make a difference. Totally worth it if you know that you'll be seeing your doctor that day-I think they have scheduled morning monitoring days. As mentioned earlier, it does get crowded on weekends and holidays.  The earlier you go within the window the better.  Monitoring hours start at 6am and I usually arrived at 5:45.  Even still there were sometimes 2-3 people ahead of me and the few times I arrived later than that there was a very long wait.The window was between 6am to 7:30am. The nurse coordinator would email me a monthly cycle itinerary.There were many people but it was a well oiled machine.  I was typically in and out within 20 minutes.I sometimes waited a long time to be seen.  If I got there early, I got seen earlier.  They did try to hurry things along by getting blood done and then waiting for ultrasound after, but if it was a busy morning, I waited for over an hour.A times there were a lot of patients during monitoring hours. However, I always tried to arrive relatively early and I never had to wait too long. It was relatively close to my job so their hours in conjunction with my  work hours worked well. On most days I did not have to wait long unless they were having staffing issues. However, West Orange does not have Saturday hours which is very inconvenient; all patients have to go to Basking Ridge and the wait is a little longer because everyone who goes to their other clinics are funneled to one facility. easy, quick, usually no waitMonitoring at RMA is quite early in the morning (6-7:30 am) which was sometimes hard for us because we were coming from out of state and typically arriving very late at night the night before. But, early mornings are an integral and expected part of the IVF process so we adapted. Monitoring appointments were very organized and well run and wait times were much shorter than I experienced at other clinics. During our treatment cycles we went to many RMA locations for monitoring and experienced this same level of efficiency.Bloodwork was quick. Ultrasound waits took much longer. While it was definitely efficient, it did feel like an assembly line. However, aside from one long wait, I never waited more than 30 minutes for monitoring. It's tedious and sometimes they are busy and sometimes they are not, but overall the monitoring appointments are fine and the hours are fairly convenient.it was very efficient - the earlier the faster you were out of there! Well oiled machine with amazing nurses that I became friendly with because I was there all the time for so longThe appointments were organized and efficient. The facility is amazing. The staff at morning monitoring are professional and caring. The monitoring window of hours is pretty strict.Morning monitoring during the week was very quick and simple, I was normally in and out within 20-30 minutes for bloodwork and ultrasound.  Weekends can get very crowded because they are their only location in NJ that is open, but after the first time seeing how many people were there I just went first thing in the morning and was in and out. A line frequently develops at the very opening of monitoring hours, but RMA is efficient at getting through this slight back up.  If you show up even 20 min shred after hours begin, there may be 1-3 people ahead of you.  I have never waited longer than 20 minutes to be seen though even at the busiest hours.Monitoring was super convenient!  Super organized and for the most part you were seen fairly quickly.Having a location near me definitely helped. Occasionally it was super swamped but for the most part I was in and out pretty quickly.Streamline and always quick. They really have it figured out.The Somerset office has a smaller waiting room, so sometimes it was standing room only. With that said, they were very good about getting people in and out, so there really wasn't much waiting around. I usually had to be there by 7:30am, which were the monitoring hours. It wasn't a problem for me because it was on my way to work, but that will be challenging next time with a toddler that has to go to daycare (in the opposite direction).I did my morning monitoring from another clinic since I lived out of state.  
The few times I did morning monitoring it seemed pretty organized.

In the basking ridge location it was fine.  From the smaller statelite locations it was very crowded and stressful experience.  I really disliked the experience at the smaller offices There is available monitoring 7 days a week. There is immediate notification to the lab team and ultrasound team when a patient arrives.  The waiting room can be busy. A patient is usually sent first for labs and then returns to the waiting room to be called for the Ultrasound (if ordered for that day).it was usually fine - in and out in an hour or less. much quicker if bloodwork only. phlebotomy is well staffed, efficient and friendly. on weekends you have to travel to the ""mother ship"" which is kind of a pain but i didn't really mind.  Monitoring hours where during the week from 545-730 even though every seat was filled in waiting room it really was quick and efficient. No extremely long waits. 
Monitoring hours are between six and 730 in the morning. It’s always crowded, but the blood work typically goes very quickly. Then you’ll go back out to the waiting room and wait for the ultrasound. Sometimes it takes a little longer for the doctor to make it into the room. But generally speaking your in and out within 30-45 minutes.I have no issues with morning monitoring hours. A hand full of times there were long wait times but I do think it’s run efficiently and worked well in the morning before work starting very early at 5:30 am to 7:30 am. The morning monitoring went smoothly on almost all occasions.  Even when the waiting room was full I rarely had to wait longer than 15 minutes or so.  You could go early in the morning from 545-730 am. They have around 10 different sattelite offices so you can go the most convenient location. 
You would sign in your name at the front desk and it’s first come first serve. Sometimes there was a line out the door at 530am. You could wait over an hour to be seen. Most days I was in and out pretty quickly.  There were a couple of days that took over an hour, which I thought was a long time. Efficient, well-oiled machine, where you feel special and like part of an elite club of patients.
I just wished they would have monitoring hours after 8am.   I have to get up super early for the appointments as I live far away.Monitoring appointments were early in the morning so you could go before work. I like the monitoring appt times now because I can go to monitoring while my husband stays home with my son and I can be back before he has to leave for work. No babysitter needed. If I was working it would have been convenient to get monitoring done before work. It was a very smooth process. I mostly did my monitoring at the Springfield office of RMA. I found the team there to be incredibly efficient. There were one or two instances in which things seemed to be running behind, but for the most part I was in and out with blood work and ultrasound within 15-20 minutes. The team was always kind and professional. The hours were early enough that I could get in and still make my regular commute to work. Occasionally I had to go to the Basking Ridge office during holidays or on weekends and it was often a different story. My monitoring appointments there sometimes took 1-1.5 hours, but I appreciated that I had a weekend option that wasn't much farther than my regular office, and that the monitoring hours were longer at that office.Monitoring was convenient for me because I work in Freehold. The wait was never insanely long. Even when every seat was filled in the office, they moved everyone swiftly. No complaints at all. It was tough on my schedule because of limited hours and a lot of people coming at the same time.Some days were busier than others with monitoring (Mondays and Fridays were busiest) but I learned the best times to go to avoid the rush, and I still felt like I was given enough time with the doctors. On weekends, we had to go a little further to the basking Ridge office because the Somerset office was closed, but the monitoring hours were longer on weekends at BR and I still felt like the wait wasn’t too bad. Extremely easy!  15 minutes in and out. Lab work was done first followed by monitoring appointments with Dr. Hong. We did see another RE for a monitoring appointment on one occasion. He was impersonal but very efficient and knowledgable.Morristown office was in and out. I monitored mostly in Englewood and there's usually a long wait. Avoid Mondays and Fridays if you can.The Morristown office seems more efficient with blood work and ultrasounds because they have more rooms available.  I also went to the West Orange location which would become more crowded than I would prefer because it is a smaller office.  I found this entire process to be extremely emotionally draining but regardless to which office I went to, once I saw the doctor, I felt hopeful and encouraged.  Visiting Morristown appeared to be a well oiled machine while visiting West Orange, on some mornings when they were busy, it seemed like I was on a slow moving conveyor belt.I found morning monitoring pretty easy. The hours are before a typical work day and occur at all offices. My retrieval cycle was during the holidays and they provided ample notice when hours and locations changed so the transition was seamless.

The process was a well oiled machine.Was a bit like cattle call for am monitoring, although was efficient and wait times were not long.  It is a bit tough when you are going through difficultly of infertility and herded in waiting room and called in to line up for labwork and then sit back again for ultrasound.  Staff was always pleasant and cheerful, esp the lab techs so that helped but it was tough at times.It is pretty efficient and if you get there early, you won't have to wait long. The phlebotomists are excellent.It depended on the day and who was running the monitoring, but 95% of the time it was a quick and easy process.    The monitoring appointments are NOT my favorite.  However I have found that there are better monitoring offices than others.  After much frustration, I realized that it was better for me emotionally if I drove to the headquarters (40 min drive) as opposed to the office that was more geographic convenient (15 min drive).  That literally made ALL the difference.  Morning monitoring is very well run at this clinic. Walk in monitoring hours run on a first come first served basis. Hours are between 6-7:30 which is extremely convenient as a full-time working patient. See previous response about clinic.  Do not do monitoring at west orange there are too many patients and not enough staff, go to basking ridge if you can.  Also I understand patients want to have their significant other there but then they are not enough seats for actual patients.  They need to have a bigger waiting area.Always busy and would often take an hour before it was your turn.If you want to be seen quickly, come around 6 AM. Monitoring appointments were a breeze.  There was never a long wait and phlebotomists new me by name. Although it did feel like we were cattle being herded, the office was very efficient and I was able to go there before working hours which made things a lot easier. At times it is busy but it is very well run and moves very quickly.  The hours are great because you can go in early before your day normally starts so it doesn't interfere with anything.Monitoring can be overwhelming but RMA does a very good job of getting people in and out. Their 530am start time works well for working professionals. I was able to monitor without having to tell my boss what was going on.They weren't too bad if you arrive earlyThe  monitoring appointments at RMA are for a specific time period.  I have to be at work at 7am .. so I typically was the first person to arrive for my ultrasound. Even when I wasn't the first person .. I never had to wait too long. And better yet, I was never late to work. Pretty much a well-oiled machine, but the wait could be long (30 mins) if you didn't get there as close to opening at 5:30am as possible.Very easy, not long wait times.  Unfriendly faces in front desk.  Like smile people!!! You CHOSE your current profession and employment situation, if you don't like it then leave!As I mentioned in a previous answer, RMA ran like a well-oiled machine. At times, it could be crowded and busy, but never unbearable. Some days they took me right away, other days, I might have to wait 20 minutes at most - it really varied.  On average, I'd say I would wait 10 minutes to be taken back for blood work.

The staff was always so friendly and helpful. Despite the stressful nature of everyone's reason to be there in the first place, it was a very stress-free place.

My only small complaint was that I wished the weekday monitoring hours went 30 minutes later so it fit with my work schedule a little better.Morning monitoring always ran smoothly. Sometimes I may of waiting up to 45 minutes due to a lot of people, but most of the time I was in and out in under 30 mins. The process of getting called for blood work and then for an ultra sound worked very well. The staff was always very friendly too.Morning monitoring, for the most part, was very quick and easy.  I was usually in and out in under half an hour, with many visits being done within 10 minutes!  One morning there was a back up and I couldn't stay.  Since it wasn't a vital day during my cycle, I wasn't worried about having to come back the next day, but I got a little bit of an attitude from the receptionist when I told her I had to leave (as a teacher, I had no wiggle room to arrive to work late).  Once I got home, I e-mailed my nurse to explain what happened and she answered within 10 minutes.  She apologized and then she told me she spoke to Dr. Molinaro and he wanted me to wait an extra day so that HE himself could see me for monitoring.Morning monitoring at RMA is a well-oiled machine. After checking in after the doors were first opened, it usually took just minutes to be called back for bloodwork. If an ultrasound was available first, the staff would place you in a room and ask you to do blood work afterwards. When at Morristown, I would always get a call with my results by the early afternoon, and if I needed to go to Basking Ridge instead, a call with my results would be made at some time during the morning. The staff at RMA know what they are doing, and work to make sure everyone is able to have a stress-free, quick morning. Ultrasound and blood work appointments were handled efficiently. I was there no longer than 30 minutes for both ultrasounds and blood work and sometimes it was less than 10 minutes for blood work. I never felt like I was just a number, but rather I felt like a patient and everyone during the early morning monitoring hours were polite and friendly. You do not wait long at RMA.  ""Monitoring"" is organized and goes quick.  
I've been to other places where we ended up waiting for hours for monitoring. Not at RMA.  RMA knows what they are doing.  I feel like they have researched and know how to do things best.Very positive all the time. No issues.They start morning monitoring early in the morning (5:30!) to make it convenient for the patients. I appreciated that we were able to go in early every morning and it would not affect our work schedule. Amazing staff- efficient and always friendly! RMA has everything you needed. Going in for blood work and ultrasound monitoring was easyThere was comfortable seating, it was a first come first served basis.  So the earlier you arrived, the sooner you'd be seen.  A nurse would come into the waiting room and call your first name.  This did not bother me.  It was run efficiently, which is what you want at 6 in the morning.  Morning monitoring was a well-oiled machine.  Even when a lot of people were waiting, it moved pretty fast.  I was able to go to the monitoring hours before work. The fact that there are so many offices made the process convenient. The monitoring staff at the Basking Ridge office were friendly and helpful.Monitoring hours were from 5:30-7:30am.  There were times when it felt like a cattle call with a  line, but it really depended on the day and how many patients were there and how early you arrived.  If you arrived closer to opening time, you rarely had to wait long.  The mornings can be tough, but are the most convenient times to not interfere with work.Highly efficient I was able to go to different clinics and mostly chose the one closer to my house so that made it very convenient.  Monitoring hours are conveniently scheduled in the morning. However even arriving at 5:45 there is a line out the door. It is first come first serve, and the system works, but there are just too many people at this clinic served by too few phlebotomists. Also, while I appreciate that only doctors do ultrasounds, there are only 2 doctors, so this slows things down enormously. I pretty much expect to be there for a half hour in the best case scenario, and sometimes for an hour or more.Was hit or miss in the waiting room but went fairly quicklyI sometimes had to wait which is difficult when trying to get to work on time.  

I did not have Dr. Foreman for all monitoring but all the doctors were great.  RMA has early morning appointments if you need them.  I am not sure why it always worked out this way because I did not have a special time, but I never waited more than a few minutes.  After my blood work there would be one person waiting and then myself.  My experience with monitoring appointments was great.  No drama.Morning monitoring was always very quick!Dr. Forman and RMA NJ are in New Jersey. I live in Brooklyn, work in Manhattan. My monitoring appointments were done in RMA Brooklyn. RMA Brooklyn would send my results to RMA New Jersey in the morning and Dr. Forman will review the results and come up with action plans in the afternoon. So the fact that I lived/worked in NY and Dr. Forman was in NJ was not much of an inconvenience.RMA opened at 6am, so I was able to get there at 5:45am and be finished in time to get to work at 7:45am, which was about 45 min away from their office.  If you arrived later, then obviously you would need to wait.  I was monitored primarily at another clinic since I was an out of town patient. Monitoring was the same at both places, during certain hours and streamlined. Run very smoothly despite all the patients coming in and out. They open even earlier then specified to be as accommodating as possible! There was always a line at the door, but they worked as fast and as efficiently as possible to get people through. A very well oiled machine!Morning monitoring was from 6 to 730 am.  You would put your name on a list and then be called in order for blood work and/or ultrasound.   Sometimes it was very crowded, but that was understandable because so many people are going through this.  If you got there a little after monitoring ended, they still let you be seen.   If you had any issue, you could always come to monitoring to be seen.  They opened the clinic for earlier hours so I always made sure to get there early so I could be back for my job. The monitoring schedule never interfered with my job. Once signed in, it was a well oiled machine to get everyone back for bloodwork and ultrasounds in the order of when you signed in. I never felt like I was sitting there as if someone skipped over me, etc. Monitoring caries each time you went and how early you went. Monitoring was between 6-7:30 (I think...how quick we forget). It was unusual to neve shave to wait but your wait could vary from 10-20 minutes in Morristown. They had a great system worked out and moved patients in and out. The phlebotomists were outstanding! Everything was extremely organized but yes there would always be some type of wait unless you went to the basking ridge office which had more doctors on call for monitoring and more phlebotomists to pull blood. There usually want much of a wait there. Monitoring hours were between 6-7:30 am on weekdays and 6-10am on weekends.  This was EXTREMELY convenient to me.  I was able to go before work each day and it didn't impact my job at all.  I didn't have to take time off of work or really inform my employer except for days where I was having a test (saline sonogram, etc) or procedure (IUI, retrieval, transfer).  I have heard of some clinic's that don't have early morning monitoring and I honestly would not have been able to pursue ART without this convenience since I have little flexibility in my job's schedule.

Most days seemed like a well oiled machine.  I moved quickly through the blood draw area to the ultrasound area with minimal wait time.  On a few occasions if they were short a doctor, the line did back up - but I wouldn't say this was the norm.  Weekends were usually more busy because a lot of the satellite offices are closed, but as long as I went in knowing that it wasn't so bad.It was an efficient well-oiled machine, with sometimes a bit of a wait in the morning.  Weekends are very hectic ... best bet, get there early.There was a good window to arrive for monitoring. There were a lot of people there, but it was run very well. It was quick and efficient but personal.I was always in and out in the basking ridge office. I loved the office itself too. It was beautiful, clean and bright. If you went in early and beat the rush you got done fast. Certain people were better than others with the monitoring.You could go in whenever you wanted for monitoring but they had early morning hours to make it convenient for working patients to come in before work.Depended on the day and office.  Morristown during the week was OK if you got there early.  Basking Ridge on the weekend was horrible.  Long waits for ultrasound. I was glad that they started early so I could get to work on time. I remembered just getting blood work first and then ultrasound second. Who does the sonogram I remembered for me was another doctor (male) so it was a sonographers. The doctor was respectful and he would tell us what he sees and tell us how big the follicles were and how many. That's about it. I always needed to get to work so I came 30 minutes before so I could be the first one seen and be in and out.The time slot for monitoring appointments was long enough that when you come in your not crowded. The person that does the blood work, is friendly and work fast . Their goal is to get you in and get you out to start your day.Monitoring appointments were definitely a cattle call, but that didn't bother me. Very organized, efficient and quick Mondays and Friday seem to be the busiest and the wait time could be long. It seems to run efficiently and smoothly. I never waited long. I got there when they opened and was seen quickly for bloodwork and then for an ultrasound. I was often in and out in about 10 minutes If you went early enough you could get in and out quickly enough. All of the doctors that I saw at the RMA clinic would come into my room with a complete understanding of where I was in the IVF process, that impressed me every single time I went.  Each doctor would pick up where the previous doctor left off.  All of the doctors worked as a team. Convenient and efficient I went first thing in the morning so I was seen promptly but by the time I would come out there were many people in the waiting area. Super efficient and well-run. I was usually in and out in 20 minutes. The lab staff was especially great. Everyone is super friendly. I was monitored at RMANY for my cycle at RMANJ so cannot describe this experience at NJEfficient, well-oiled machine. Usually in and out within 20 minutes for bloodwork and ultrasound. There were many mornings I was in and out in 10 minutes which was EXTREMELY helpful because I needed early and quick since I am a teacher.I could go in between certain hours in the morning, it worked well with my work schedule. Well oiled machine. Never waited too long. it was the best that cloud be erly morning wait but OK Depending on the day. Most of the time it was within an hour. It was ok bc phlebotomist were amazing Early mornings.
Some times many ppl. Some tines just a few.
But still able to get to work on time.The monitoring window worked great for us.  Moitoring was convenient and the wait was usually minimal It was fine, but some days it got backed up and there was something of a wait. I would imagine that could happen anywhere, though.Ok sometimes rushed and you never knew who you would see.This is a walk in sign in kinda place. No apts needed for blood work or ultra sounds. Hours started at 6:00 or 6:30 amLong wait times There was a wait at times but never too bad they were pretty efficient and always good experiences with blood draws.The hours were adjusted because of the coronavirus, so there was a longer window of time than normal, which allowed less congestion. For this reason I didn't have to wait long. Still one time I did have to wait over 20 minutes in the room, as the person monitoring me was on a patient call.Morning monitoring was always very efficient. At RMA the monitoring hours were between 6am-7:30am, but if something had to be changed they would accommodate something for me. At times, morning monitoring could get very busy, but I never had to wait more than 15 minutes to be seen.I loved the monitoring schedule window of time. Typically I waited less than 10 minutes and I was one who needed to lay down for bloodwork in a room. There were days with longer waits but overall it was very efficient. After a while you get use to monitoring hours. It’s nothing awkward about it. We all know why we are there. ",9.10000000000001,9.10000000000001,"I couldn't imagine having been on this journey with anyone other than Dr. Werner and the entire team at RMA. Even though there are a lot of doctors and you will see a lot of them they are all very good at what they do. They answered all of my questions and made me feel part of the process. I was always impressed with the care we received from each area of the office. This is so helpful in such an emotional process. Hard to get an appt with a specific doctor sometimes. This clinic is very expensive, it's easy to access even by public transportation, you don't lost time when you go for blood text, I believe they are good in term of result but I think they may have a program that help financially according to each patient financial capacity. At the time of treatment, the retrieval and transfer were done at the RMA Basking Ridge office, which is also high-tech and professional. No general information about what to do to have a successful cycle. They are organized and quick with their processes. The clinic is definitely a baby making machine, so it is very regimented. They do not ask about supplements and so I don't know if taking or not taking supplements impacted by results. Also when having ultrasound monitoring in Basking Ridge on the weekends, I never knew which doctor I would be seeing and that experience was a bit too cold and 'assembly line' for me...I appreciate that they have a long line of patients to monitor each morning, but the doctors need to also appreciate that fertility patients aren't just a number. It is a good clinic with great doctors and nurses. They have many locations that you can go to for morning monitoring. It could feel factory like from time to time due to the size especially when visiting the basking ridge nj office. The clinic was always very clean and organized, with light music making for a relaxed atmosphere. Even though it's a large practice, I think they go through a lot of effort to consider the patient experience, though I think there are small things they could improve in this regard - like providing more info on your full care team (either on the website or as a packet of info when you first start care), streamlining the educational resources they provide, and/or creating a phone system that's a bit easier to navigate. All staff is very knowledgeable and caring. Very organized...the process is well thought out to keep you on track...ivf is a very emotional process and no except the social worker (1 visit)plugged into the emotional aspect of it. None were overly compassionate and a few actually said some insensitive things to me after a miscarriage such as, “it worked once, it’ll work again,” as if my loss wasn’t that big of a deal. All of the office staff were also great and helpful anytime I had a question when I called or while I’m clinic. The numbers pretty much speak for themselves, as this is an experienced clinic with excellent doctors. I didn't feel like it was a cattle call and I never waited more than 30 minutes. The earlier you got there the better and sometimes  I was in and out in 20 minutes for BW & US.They try to make it as convenient as possible. Waiting room is a little small and Tuesday morning monitoring always got backed up... otherwise they were quick and efficient!The clinic is clean and organized. The only weakness is the office is on the smaller side and sometimes you have to travel to another office for monitoring if they aren’t open on the weekends. phlebotomy is well staffed, efficient and friendly. Highly efficient I was able to go to different clinics and mostly chose the one closer to my house so that made it very convenient."
60,RMA of New Jersey,protocol,"Antagonist protocol with a Lupron trigger as I was at risk for OHSSFemara days 3-7, IUI after a positive OPK and ultrasound to confirm mature folliclesWe did one IUI, and then we went straight to IVF. Dr. Werner suggested IVF with ICSI due to minor male factor. We had 26 eggs retrieved due to PCOS and 5 embroys after PGS. Currently we are waiting for the transfer.We used the long lupron protocol, stimmed for 8 days, resulting in 11 eggs, 8 fertilized with ICSI, and we had 2 day 6 blastocysts. We elected to do PGS, which resulted in a single normal embryo.Due to health issues, I wanted to fastest route to pregnancy. Dr. Foreman fully understood this and we began a freeze-all IVF with ICSI cycle shortly after a hysteroscopy. After getting CCS testing I underwent a natural FET.For us, Dr. Doherty started right on IVF preparation because we had multiple failed IUI cycles and a failed IVF cycle with another practice. We appreciated that he listed to our current state and was willing to pick up with the other practice left off. He also performed surgery twice to remove fibroids prior to the egg retrieval/transfer.I was on an estrogen-primed antagonist protocol.  I had bloodwork and ultrasounds on day 3 (baseline), after 3 days of stims, after 5 days, and after 6 days.  I triggered after 6 days of stims.  My stims were 150 IU of menopur and 200 IU of follistim.  I started ganirelix on day 4 of stims. At my egg retrieval, 3 eggs were retrieved, of which 2 were mature.  Both of my two eggs were fertilized with ICSI and both made it to 5 day blastocysts.  One was transferred to me, resulting in my current pregnancy, and the other was frozen.  I am very pleased with these results, especially with my DOR.I was debating between using IUI or IVF. Dr. Forman presented the pros and cons of both treatments to me. I picked IVF in the end because its chance of success is higher, although it's more expensive with more complicated procedure.Dr. Forman is extremely cautious about medications. He doesn't want you to have 40 eggs to get the best selection, he wants you to be healthy throughout the entire process. 1st iui - used only ovidrel
2nd and 3rd  - folistim and ovidrel 
Gonal F with ganirelix for egg retrieval. There was no further testing of my husband's sperm or efforts to correct the morphology. We ended up with only one normal embryo to use. They did ICSI and PGS testing. Transferred one embryo during a medicated cycle my lining was over 16. I am on progesterone in oil, progesterone suppositories 3x day, benadryl 3x day, delestrogen needle, metformin, doxycycline, methylprednisoloneFor the egg retrieval I was injecting 450 units of follistim until the egg retrieval . 
I wanted the option of CCS of the embryos, until I got the results I was started on a birth control pill once the results were in i was recommended a medicated FET. I was using Pio injections and oral estraceI was a 40 yr old single woman with a blocked tube. IUI was recommended with the help of Clomid and an objectively that I dont remember. We did IUI on 2 co securities mornings and I was pregnant with twins on that first try. When I made the appointment with this clinic I thought the doctor would be the one who does all of my monitoring which I have not seen him since I started the cycle.  This cycle with injectable medications I only had one follicle I told him that next cycle I would like to increase my dose but he said that he will not do that in fear of multiples even though we are willing to take the risk.  Not sure how to evaluate the outcome as I'm still in my 2ww.  Positive thing about the clinic is that they do back-to-back iui's which increases the chances...
I was at the beginning of my journey so she told me the treatment was conservative and we would see how i responded.There were several changes to our treatment strategy that were recommended by Dr. Franasiak. 

On the diet and nutrition side, in getting ready for our retrieval, his office recommended going dairy and gluten free to cut down on inflammation. They also recommended a microbiome protocol which included high potency pre- and pro-biotics, and vaginal probiotic when we got to the transfer stage. Both my husband and I also tested positive for MTHFR mutations, and as a precaution, we were recommended to take 5g of methylfolate per day (people with MTHFR have a higher likelihood of aneuploid embryos). 

On the medication side, I did about two weeks of estrogen priming with estradiol, and then eventually took about 450 IUs of Gonal-F or Follistim and about 50 IUs of low-dose HGC. I went in every few days for the ultrasound. One big difference I noticed from other clinics, is that I was triggered earlier with Dr. Franasiak's office. All of this resulted in our highest number of eggs (18), which made five embryos, of which an astounding four were chromosomally normal. 

Dr. Franasiak diagnosed me with endometriosis, which was 60-days of lupron prior to the frozen embryo transfer. During this time, I was also treated for chronic endometritus, which was about 2-weeks of antibiotics. The transfer was seamless, professional, and now I'm pregnant with a baby boy.
Our protocol was egg retrieval with injectable atoms, ICSI fertilization, day 5 blastocysts then PSG testing which the clinic mandates. All of these options while being more expensive are to maximize the likelihood of quality embryos for transfer. I then had a polyp removal to ensure my uterus was optimal for transfer. Our transfer was FET.  My first cycle was an antagonist protocol. It was unsuccessful. We changed to a microburst protocol for the second retrieval to allow for better quality eggs and that’s exactly what we got. She also recommended adding a specific folate supplement during the second ER. We have not begun the embryo transfer cycle yet. I will update when we begin. It was supposed to be a slow grow of my eggs. It was supposed to be a different result from the first cycle. When the results seemed to be similar the week of the retrieval I asked if they’d suggest canceling the cycle and they did not agree and I felt their professional opinion would be better than mine. This cycle had worse results than the first. My first protocol I don't remember the name of but I will say that I did not get a whole lot of big follicles. Rather than cancel the protocol I was pushed through. Knowing what I know now I think that round should have been cancelled. We could have cancelled and tried again with another round of medications to see if the follicles would have come out bigger. I didn't and the cycle was a bit of a dud. The following two retrievals I pushed for different medications and I had much better success than the first. The second cycle I was on a microflare protocol and the third on a microflare protocol with clomid. I had the best cycle with the third.Protocols were not aggressive. Medications were conservatively increased for me. This is understandable because when I first tried clomid for my first cycle, I developed a 40 mm cyst. Dr Shastri was afraid I would develop ovarian torsion so she cancelled the cycle.  I wish they would have scheduled more monitoring because I felt there were a number of times where I ovulated early and by the time I received my IUI it was too late. My nurse said they don’t rely on at home ovulation predictor tests. My first cycle I did a micro-flare protocol. I was on 40 units of lupron daily with 450 gonal F. I was a poor responder and only retrieved one egg. It did become a blast though. My second cycle i was on 300 gonal F and 75 menopur. I retrieved 2 eggs and one made it to blast. My third cycle I am doing the same menopur cycle.We were going to start with an IUI but my insurance decided not to cover it when they saw I had a partially dilated tube. Dr. Shastri did a peer to peer with my insurance provider to try to justify the coverage but they wouldn’t budge. We decided to move forward with IVF. We started with the protagonist protocol taking the highest dose of Gonal f and low does HCG. I wasn’t reacting to the medication but we decided to keep going as my estrogen was slowly rising. After 15 days we had one follicle that was looking good and we were planning on doing the retrieval since I have DOR and didn’t want to waste a good egg. Unfortunately at my last appointment my estrogen had gone down and Dr. Shastri didn’t want to put me under for just one egg that she didn’t think was viable anymore. She also was considerate of my insurance situation and didn’t want to use all of my coverage on the surgery that she wasn’t confident would yield the results we wanted. We took a break and are now in the process of trying the Lupron Flair protocol.I don’t entirely remember the exact protocol. We did injections of gonal f, menapur, ganirelix, along with a trigger shot. Once retrieval ended, we did estradiol 2x a day until transfer along with pio shots starting 5 days prior to transfer. I did an antagonist protocol with max doses of each medication. We did this because my ovarian reserve is diminishing rapidly. We also did ICSI because my husband has a very low sperm count. The first thing she said to us (after seeing our disastrous-for-my-age IVF results) was: why are you still using this donor? He’s not your husband! Love the bluntness. 
We did indeed switch donors, and did an antagonist protocol (instead of MDLF); the rationale was that I’m not a poor responder, but we had a mysteriously awful blastocyst rate — she thought the Lupron and/or long stim time could be compromising egg quality. There was also a possibility that the donor sperm was not good.
She also immediately tested my thyroid, because my day 3 values were weird — and I was hypothyroid, so she put me on synthroid. We tested my fasting insulin on a whim, and discovered I had severe insulin resistance (no PCOS), so she started me on metformin.
My most recent egg retrieval was fewer eggs than prior, but from 12 eggs we tested 4 embryos (PGS and PGD) and have 3 PGS normal unaffected!We did ivf because of low morphology. I was on Gonal-F amongst other injections for egg retrieval. We used ICSI and did pgs testing recommended by the doctor because of my husbands genes.For my case where I had been unexplained infertility, but now DOR. (Low AMH and high FSH) Primed with estrace pill at end of my natural cycle leading up to IVF cycle. Gonal F and lupron and low dose HSG stims. Trigger shot Novarel. Dr. Costantini was very honest in her advice for us. IVF would be our best option. My husband and I weren’t ready to do that right away as our insurance does not cover any cost. She was extremely understanding and patient. We decided to try clomid and TI in the meantime but are now ready to move on to IVF with her help.  IVF- saline sonogram to confirm presence of fibroids, scar tissue,etc. Sema4 genetic testing to confirm my partner and I are not carriers for the same diseases. Nutritional consult for healthy lifestyle. IVF egg retrieval medications: Gonal F, lodose HCG, cetrotide. Pregnyl and lupron trigger. 13 eggs retrieved, 11 mature.
PCOS treatment- blood test and sonogram,  confirmed and prescribed me metformin.We previously completed four treatment cycles at another clinic, to no avail. Three of which I was prescribed Clomid, and the final one we used Gonal-F. Dr. Franasiak started my first treatment cycle with Gonal-F and had increased my dosage to 100 mL, which was higher than we had previously been prescribed. My follicles developed at different rates each time however, Dr. Franasiak kept a close eye on same.  That being said, I did not use Gonal-F for the same number of days each cycle. A few times we were asked to come in a couple days in a row, rather than every other day. This was for Dr. Franasiak's reassurance that all was happening as planned, and to prevent over development of my follicles and any other potential issues.I have been on letrozole for 3 cycles with my OBGYN and he wants me to do one or two with him so he can monitor me. He explained the difference with IUI/injections  and IVF with PCOS. I had to do two separate egg retrieval’s as my first med protocol did not stimulate me well enough. This was a challenge due to my low AMH and ovary recovering from cancer surgery. The second protocol produce three times more eggs and was much more successful. I was on an agonist protocol with low dose HCG and Follistim. 10 units of low dose HCG and 275 of Follistim. I triggered with Lupron. I know that after egg retrieval, they did some sort of calcium addition to help with egg fertilization which helped a lot. We did a freeze-all cycle and had PGS testing done which resulted in 7 normal blastocysts. First transfer cycle- we transferred one embryo which resulted in an early miscarriage.

I am on track to do 4 medicated IUI cycles and if they do not take, move forward with IVF.  First IUI I was given 50mg Gonal-F and then was increased to 150mg with an Ovradrell trigger shot.  After starting the Gonal-F, my migraines that I have had since a teenager were uncontrollable.  Reaching out to Dr Bergh regarding this, he switched my medicine to Clomid, 50mg for the second cycle.  If the 4 IUI's do not take, I will meet with him beforehand to discuss the treatment options for IVF due to the necessary medication.  I was under Dr. Kaser's care for my 3rd FET.   He had me take my estrace pills vaginally to increase the lining quicker and the standard progesterone dosage. Prior to the cycle he performed an ERA and endometrial biopsy to ensure we were transfering on the right day and there was no infection.  Unfortunately my 3rd FET resulted in a negative pregnancy test and we will be changing the protocol significantly for my 4thMy husband and I have undergone four iui cycles with no luck yet. While taking follistism, too many eggs developed and Dr. Doherty made the decision to lessen the amount of medication I was taking so that we would not risk the chance of having multiples. Only the strongest follicles survived and we were able to continue with our iui cycle. We started with egg retrieval immediately as he didn't feel IUI was an option for me. He tried egg retrieval twice but then felt it wouldn't be ethical to continue trying as I was a ""low responder."" We moved onto an egg donor which initially produced a pregnancy. I was offered acupuncture on day of transfer. The miscarriage occurred after my discharge from fertility care. Now they have placed me on probiotics/prebiotics in prep for my next transfer cycle.I came from other fertility doctors so he reviewed by file and determined IVF was the best choice for me. He did a saline ultrasound and determined my uterus posed a problem for future pregnancy so he made sure I had that taken care of before starting treatment. I was hesitant to start since I am a self pay patient and he was very patient and understanding.We did the strongest protocol (""maxed out"") due to my low AFC and AMH, which meant that I took hcg with Follistim 450. Then I took cetrotide for the trigger shot. Estrogen priming protocol for stimulation which worked very well. He also put me on supplements to help with egg quality. After two stimulation cycles and a FET I got pregnant and delivered a healthy baby.  We were fortunate to just have one IVF retrieval that yielded great results. When our first transfer failed, we did an ""all in"" approach, adding steroid, anti-histamine, aspirin etc. She also did a biopsy and a scratch, which made me feel like we were doing everything we possibly could to achieve the pregnancy.Dr. Fischer put me on Gonal F and other injection medications for my egg retrieval I cannot recall them all, after my egg retrieval I did a genetic screen test on all my embryos, she then froze the rest of the good ones and during my transfer she transferred only one healthy embryo and I am now pregnant! She recommended doing a cycle of IVF for egg retrieval and PGS testing first to make sure I even have good embryos first, then proceeding with fibroid removal prior to doing any transfers. Because I was very hesitant to have fibroid removal surgery, she did give me an alternate option to do egg retrieval and transfer one embryo to try, but told me that if it fails she would not recommend doing any additional transfers until the fibroid is removed. I choose not to proceed with Dr Chu and went elsewhere.Dr.Doherty told us we had to do ivf if insurance covered it. We did ivf and the retrieval but due to insurance not covering the extra testing we did not test the eggs. We had two chemicals with only 1 embryo left. Dr. Doherty had me do biopsy and put me on synthroid for a thyroid problem I had developed. He also had me on doxyclycine and had us do another retrieval to test. We got 4 embryos that came back all healthy and normal and we finally prepped for our 3 transfer which we are now 8 weeks 5 days pregnant!!! :) In 2018 I went back to RMA to use my frozen embryos.  We initially tried estrogen pills to build my lining, but that was unsuccessful.  Dr. Hong changed my protocol to be more similar to what I did for my retrieval in 2014 which included follistim, ganirelix, and pregnyl, which thickened my lining enough for transfer. We were going to try a few rounds of IUI since my test results were great and I seem to have an unexplained infertility.  Dr. Drews suggested that I use something other than Clomid because of my age (I was 37 at the time).   He said that Clomid doesn't work as well for people my age - I later used Clomid and responded well to it.  We did not get to the first IUI because a week before I would have started the process, my assigned nurse called to say that I had to lose weight. I was not even given the option of proceeding.When seeing Dr Chu I was still considered ""unexplained infertility"". I did 3 rounds of IUI with gonal-f. First round, I did gonal-f 50mg with blood work and ultrasound monitoring every few days, followed by 2 days of IUI once follicles were deemed ""mature."" Second round, we followed the same protocol and dose of gonal-f. After our second round failed, I was begging for more diagnostics to try and see why it hasnt worked. They redrew the same day 3 labs as when we first started and we moved forward with another IUI. This round we did increase the gonal-f to 75mg followed by 2 back to back IUIs but again it failed. Menpur, Follistim, ganirelix, lupron trigger
49 eggs, 46 were mature"", 33 fertilized, 14 made it to blast, and 7 were genetically normal
1 FET - miscarried a little over 6 weeksThe 1st month was the diagnostic month, where they ran tests on me and my husband. Next, he removed my uterine polyps. Then he put me on injectable hormones for the egg retrieval. Then I had the egg transfer and I got pregnant right away. He monitored me for the next 8 weeks to make sure that embryo was growing correctly through the beginning of my pregnancy.I went straight to IVF with ICSI given some male infertility issues we had, in addition to my struggles with PCOS.  After my first egg retrieval, after genetic testing, I only had 1 viable embryo, so my husband went to a urologist and then we did a second retrieval after he had a tese procedure done.   That resulted in two viable embryos.  With three embryos, we decided to transfer the strongest one in January 2019.  I am currently almost 10 weeks pregnant.We went through IVF with ICSI.  The retrieval was successful but Dr. Bergh was concerned that I would hyperstimulate, so he took the time to explain why he wanted to freeze all the embryos and do a frozen transfer in 6 weeks.  Though it was disappointing to me, he really helped me understand why.  And then the transfer of two embryos was successful, though one miscarried at 5 weeks, and Dr. Bergh was there to help me.   The first frozen cycle used Lupron to set up the cycle.  The second cycle went with my natural period.  Both transfers resulted in a live birth.  I have a son and a daughter now and we are very thankful.High level of follistim, hCG and lupron. While she was good about explaining the diagnostic process and my diagnosis she did not really explain why she used the protocol and what she was trying to accomplish with each drug. I ended up with a lead follicle. Talking to others an reading articles, there may have been a better way to handle the lead follicle to allow other follicles to catch up.When we first consulted with Dr. Hong, she reviewed several treatment strategies with us. We already had frozen embryos in storage from our first IVF cycle, but they were still at Boston IVF. We wanted to try for another child using only these frozen embryos (we were not interested in pursuing any further IVF cycles). She explained several available options, and ultimately we decided that we would ship our embryos to RMA NJ (the most expensive shipping of my life!!). We would then do an embryo thaw to perform CCS, in order to rule out any unviable embryos. Next the viable remaining embryos would be frozen again in preparation for FET. We also discussed option for knowing the sex. I would undergo a natural (unmedicated) cycle. I didn't even know that natural cycles were an option with FET! I was very happy about this. Although it required more monitoring leading up the time of ovulation (many 6am appointments!!), the bonus was that I didn't have to take any medications aside from the trigger shot and then progesterone (vaginal suppository). Only one injection! It was so much easier than my previous fresh IVF cycle. Right before our embryos shipped, Dr. Hong called me in a panic because she had just been discussing our case with the embryologist who realized in my medical records that our former IVF cycle was the result of conventional IVF, not ICSI. You cannot do CCS with conventional IVF embryos! We were initially very disappointed to hear this, but rebounded quickly and decided to pursue the FET cycle without any genetic testing, just letting nature take its course so to speak. Ultimately we got very lucky. The first natural cycle FET led to pregnancy, and our baby girl was born at 41 weeks on 11/30/2018. We ended up doing injectables and IUI, Dr. Morris felt they would be the most effective for our situation and she was right. I really appreciated how she did not push IVF even after the first few IUIs didn’t work. Protocol was a PCOS specific protocol which resulted in the greatest number of viable embryos at day 5 from a retrieval. I’ve done only medicated IUIs all according to our plan - but extended quantity wise due to Insurance requiring a “lesser vs. more” clause. We did an Antagonist protocol with estrogen priming which included Estrace for 10 days (during the luteal phase) leading up to CD1. Low dose HCG starting on CD1, Gonal F (or Follistim) starting on  CD3, Ganirelix (or Cetrotide) starting on CD8, Omnitrope (HGH) for last few days before retrieval.

- The rational for estrogen priming with Estrace was to facilitate a more gradual and coordinated growth of follicles. 

- The low dose-HCG is a much less expensive alternative to Menopur. We were given the option of Menopur or low dose HCG and we picked low dose HCG because of the cost (and had better results).

- The Gonal F (or Follistim) was used to stimulate the follicles to grow

- The Ganirelix (or Cetrotide) was used to prevent ovulation while stimulating. 

- The Omnitrope (HGH) was an add-on (optional) which we added to improve egg quality. The jury is still out on it but we had success in the two cycles where we used it (and failure in the 2 cycles where we didn't) so I think it's worth trying. 

With this protocol we had more eggs retrieved, more fertilized eggs, more blasts, and more PGS/CCS euploid embryos. 

My first protocol consisted of Estrace, follistim, low dose hcg, ganirelix, and Pregnyl as the trigger. That protocol yielded 8 mature embryos. 7 made it to the next day, 5 made it to blastocyst stage, and 2 were genetically normal. 

My second protocol consisted of Estrace, Lupron, low dose hcg, follistim, and pregnyl as the trigger. That protocol yielded 15 embryos. 13 made it to the next day and 6 made it to blastocyst stage. We are waiting for the genetic testing results to come back. She told us the likelyhood of getting pregnant with IUI (20% in our case), and let us make the choice to do that or jump to IVF. We chose IUI and Dr. Hong suggested 3 rounds only. She didn't want us to waste our time or money doing more, but felt 2 wasn't a fair amount to give it it work. IVF protocols used were standard for RMANJ. We got a beautiful baby girl after our first embryo transfer, so whatever the rationale was, I approve!My treatment included gonal f and low dose hcg. It resulted in a successful egg collection with a large number of eggs retrieved. Unfortunately after our retrieval, we did not get the outcome we were hoping for, but meds were adjusted for the next round. After having a successful IVF with RMA our first time (with Dr. Forman), Dr. Morris used our first treatment strategy as a guide, while alternating a few aspects. 
In the end, our results were the same as the first time, 6 eggs retrieved (I have a diminished ovarian count), 4 took to ICSI, and one Embryo created. I tested a positive low beta on day 9, and ended up losing the pregnancy on day 11.I did ""max protocol"" for the meds - high dose of gonal. I got 12 eggs - which were more than expected but only 1 made it to day 5 - which was unexpected. I went through many treatments but basically when they were trying to retrieve eggs or I was going through iui I used gonal F and the highest dose because otherwise my folicals did not grow.  We started with IUI with injections. We used Follistim and started with a very low dosage 50IU a day to start and upping to 75IU the last few days. I had a good response to the meds. I’m currently waiting for the results of the first treatment. I only had a short window for egg retrieval between my surgery and the beginning of my chemotherapy treatments. Dr. Hong had me begin my retrieval shots outside of the typical timeline, and explained it was totally fine and wouldn't result in an inferior quality cycle. She was completely correct.After our initial consult ion with Dr. Werner my husband and I found out that we are carrier for the same gene disorder.  We needed to have a probe created to be able to test our embryos.  This process took a few months.  Once we had our probe created, I went straight to stimulation medications on day 3 of my cycle.I was on 275 units of gonal- F and 10 units of low does HGC for 14 days.  On day 9 I was instructed to also incorporate a vial of Ganerelix.  Two days prior to my egg retrieval my estrogen level was over 9,000.  I was instructed to just do a lupron trigger shot to avoid OHSS.  They were able to retrieve 30 eggs, 18 were fertilized and 12 were frozen on day 7.  Dr. Molinar’s overall strategy was probably different than most others experience given I am going through CO-IVF and acting as the gestational carrier for my wife’s eggs.  First we had to go through six rounds of IUI to prove infertility.  The first three we did without medications and the second three with injections.  After six failed IUI attempts with no positive results, my wife was diagnosed infertile which allowed us to advance to IVF.  Because her health (back issues) deteriorated over the course of treatment, we decided to make me the carrier.  We were able to retrieve 14 eggs from her first retrieval, of which 11 were mature, 9 fertilized, and 3 made it to day 5 blastocyst stage.  We tested those three and ended up with 2 grade A embryos.  My first transfer did not result in a pregnancy.  I was taking 1 ml of progesterone shots nightly leading up to and after the transfer and estrace pills 2 times daily before and after the transfer.  My second attempt following the same protocol with the exception of estrace 3 times daily after the transfer resulted in a low beta result which climbed for a few days only to fall about a week later.  At first we thought that I was having an ectopic pregnancy, but it was later thought that it had either been an early miscarriage or a chemical pregnancy.  We are about to do another retrieval round with my wife as we are out of embryos.I started with Dr. Rybak back in 2013.  Treatments varied from then to now as then we did co-ivf.  I was on Lupron 2 week kit, Estrace 2 mg, Medrol, Antibiotic, and progesterone in oil for transfer.  My wife was on other medications for retrieval.  At the end of 2017 to the beginning of this year, we did 3 IUI cycles.  I was on Gonal-F (dosage ranged from  75-100 units).  Recently, for retrieval I was on Gonal-F (375-450 units), Ganirelix (250 mcg), low dose HCG (50 units), and Lupron for trigger.  I had always responded well to treatments so the protocol was the same for all IUIs and for retrieval I responded well too.For the first three transfers, I was on estrogen twice a day and then PIO injections until the transfer. After the fails, we went a different route for a mock transfer and used Follistim to try to get my lining thicker and then triggered with Ovidrel and then PIO shots. The mock was to test my lining with an ERA test to see if the transfers were on the correct day. IUI protocol - stims were Gonal - F, and ovidrel trigger

Egg retrieval was stims - Gonal- F, certitude, ovidrel trigger.

Did need to do Birth Control to delay period for IVF CYCLEDr Yih only did 2 chlomid cycles with us because my insurance would not pay for the ivf at the time. I did a few FSH blood test to see if I still had viable eggs.  although my numbers were going up they were still in the range of having viable eggs even though I was 45 years old.  I feel she should have tried to take some eggs to freeze and or test to see if they were of a good quality.  now that I am 50 I know that my eggs are not a quality that  I could use them for my own ivf.  Neither of the rounds of chlomid were positive. I was glad to try them because it gave me hope that it definitely could happen for us because if you don't try you have 0 chance of getting pregnant.We first saw the doctor last summer and continued to try on our own while getting the work up which took a bit longer than usual due to work conflicts then in January we learned that we were pregnant and came in for a workup because of recurring miscarriages at this time we learned it was ectopic.  Dr. Franasiaks initial recommendation was methotrexate with monitoring as it was early in the pregnancy and unfortunately that didn't work and I needed a salpingectomy.  The methotrexate will be out of my system by May 1st and we will be moving forward with our first cycleI don't remember any protocols specifically.I started with two retrievals and each on produced few eggs which didI started with 1 monitored intercourse cycle, 3 cycles of IUI and then went to IVF with success. Dr. Hock was willing to consider IVF without doing endless cycles of IVF. She recommended implantation of 1 embryo only to reduce the risk with multiples.I really don't remember other than I did 2 FETs (so far, a third is planned). The first was a medicated protocol which I ovulated through. It ended up being an unsuccessful FET - negative beta with a PGS normal embryo. The second was a natural cycle, which I liked so much better. I wish we had discussed medicated vs. natural upfront because if we had, I would have chosen natural for the first FET. Of course, I'll never know if it would have made a difference. Second FET was a chemical, so at least we got a positive beta! Those were not PGS tested embryos so assume the chemical was due to abnormal embryos given my age of 42 when they were retrieved. After each cycle the medications where adjusted each plan was sought through. When We saw after the first cycle I needed a very high dose of gonal-f . After I referred my older sister to dr rybak I told my sister to tell dr rybak we are sisters and if he could go straight to the highest dose of gonal-g because lower didn’t work for me. He listened and thank god they retrieved one 3 eggs . Only one fertilized and made it through PGD and she is joe pregnantStarted with 7 days of Alyacen to raise estrogen. Follistim AQ + Menopur. Ganirelix to suppress ovulation and Pregnyl for trigger. I had 4 egg retrieval with microdose Lupron flare protocol. The rationale was that I have DOR and it would be the most effectiveSo far I have completed diagnostics and surgical correction.  I’ve had Lab work, genetic testing and consultaion with a genetics councillor, I’ve had an uktrasound, and SIS, and HSG, and a hysteroscopic polypectomy.  This cycle I will be using Clomid and will be monitored for ovulation and IUI.We used estradiol first. Then  low-dose hCG, Cetrotide, and Gonal F. For the trigger it was Lupron and Pregnyl. I responded well to most. Gonal F gave me terrible headaches. High levels of stims to get the most eggs (said I needed it even though I was 31). When asked about it affecting quality of eggs she does not think so, other doctors may disagree.
Transfer protocol is pretty typical estradiol and progesterone. Ask about a natural transfer. All of mine have been medicated and just found out I didn’t necessarily need that.
Hysteroscopy should be done for all patients not just saline sonogram. All testing for blood clotting disorders and other auto immune tests should be done before first transfer not after a failure or miscarriage.I took Clomid for 5 days (cycle days 3-7) and had a trigger injection of Ovidrel on Day 16, after my blood-work and ultrasound showed that I was ready to ovulate. I went in on Day 17 and Day 18 for two back-to-back IUI procedures. I have follow up bloodwork on this Friday, Day 24, and an appointment scheduled for next Friday, Day 31, for a pregnancy test, unless the period comes sooner.  I started without knowing I had any infertility issues with high prospects that I would become pregnant quickly.  I ended up having 9 unsuccessful IUIs with and without medication.  For the first I took Clomid and overreacted and had to skip the cycle - I was very upset but Dr. Kaser convinced me to stay positive and continue and was prepared with a plan for the next cycle.  After that we tried several ""natural"" cycles, which also failed.  Then Dr. Kaser recommended trying injectable medications.  Once I did have a positive pregnancy test, but it turned out to be a chemical pregnancy.  It was very difficult to get through, but again Dr. Kaser encouraged me not to give up.  After a few more unsuccessful IUIs (my insurance did not cover IVF which is why I tried to avoid it), Dr Kaser convinced me that I would have much better chances with IVF.  I completely trusted him and went forward with the egg retrieval cycle which was successful and frozen embryo transfer - also successful!  I am now 38 weeks pregnant.  I feel even though it took well over a year for me to get pregnant, Dr. Kaser did whatever he could to make it happen while taking my concerns into account.  I know if I went with IVF sooner it wouldn't have taken so long but it was a process I had to go through before understanding that was the best (maybe only) option.  Dr. Kaser was patient and supportive.Started out on 225 IU Follistim & 75 IU Menopur every night. Follicles are not growing very fast. Depending on bloodwork she may increase my medication dosage tonight (Day 6) will find out this afternoon.So far, one round of iui in process with clomid and ovidrel trigger. This is due to me having unexplained infertility and therefore was the recommended course of action the avoid the high oop costs of ivf. I used gonal F and another injection to promote egg growth he was happy with my results and I was able to trigger in a about a week. I did 3 cycles with injectables and timed intercourse which failed. One round of IuI which failed. 
The IVF cycle was successful- for egg retrieval I did birth control, menopur Gonal-F, ovidrel 
For embryo transfer did estrace and progesterone. Metrogel the night before. Egg retrieval was 2 vials of menopur and 300 gonal and cetrotide.  For 2 rounds of stims. First round 5 eggs, 2 fertilized and 1 made it to blast and was pgs tested Normal.  Second round.  6 eggs. 3 fertilized. 2 made to blast. 2 tested Normal for pgs. 
For my first frozen transfer I started on estradiol. 5 days before transfer I start with PIO injections.  My transfer didn’t implant. I stopped all meds on day 9 after negative beta. I was diagnosed with POI, so we always knew that I would need to use a egg donor. Dr. Doherty went thru the whole process with me and gave me more than enough time to think it thru. 

I decided to use one of RMA's egg donor and my nurse would follow up with me to see when I would want to be put on the list. We took our time just because wee were still hoping that we would somehow naturally conceive but we gave ourselves a deadline. Then we decided to move forward. 

Once we were on the list, we were matched quite quickly. They did have me complete a ""test cycle"" prior to starting the journey just to make sure that I would be able to get a embryo transfer. They noted that I also had a polyp at that time. 

Once I was matched, my nurse kept in constant contact with me, reminding me on my meds, appts and everything in between - she was AMAZING as well! I was pretty delinquent about my appts at first, but she would just follow up and make adjustments accordingly. 

I only had to have 1 cycle, but they were so helpful. I just couldn't have asked for a better team. 

I am an older patient (over 40).   She never expressed any negativity towards me like other doctors did.  I had good AMH, LH/FSH, and many follicles showing on initial visit.  She started me on 300 Follistim/Gonal, 150 menopur, then added in Ganirelex a few days later, and then a lupron trigger with an HCG shot.   We had very good results with this so it was definitely a good call I think.We used follistim and ovidrel for the iui cycles.  The cycles we did not do iui, had the same medications. My body responded very well and a few follicles matured each time.

It was also recommended to be on Metformin for the PCOS and synthroid for thyroid levels.I didn't get very far into the protocol and my protocol was different because we were using donor embryo.He wanted to do 1 embryo transfer only even after I discussed Doing 2 embryos. He felt as if a singleton pregnancy was safest for myself and my future child. He also had my thyroid tested and put me on thyroid meds once I was pregnant because it was low and he didn’t want it to interfere with my pregnancy in any way. During retrieval he recommended I do laser acupuncture before and after the procedure to increases chances of baby “sticking”, and yes it did work!We started with two IUI cycles, mostly because that was all my insurance would cover at the time. With a diagnosis of diminished ovarian reserve (my AMH level was 0.82), we thought it was worth trying, but we knew the odds of success were low. Both times I was prescribed 75mL of Gonal F per day. The first time I continued the Gonal F shots for 7 days; the second time for 8 days before taking a 750 mcg/0.5mL syringe of Ovidrel as my trigger shot. I was also taking 600mg per day of CoQ10 (a supplement) during both cycles. Dr. Jurema was willing to try another IUI cycle, but my insurance had changed to provide some coverage for IVF, so we decided to move on. During my egg retrieval cycle I took Alyacen birth control pills for 8 days leading up to the cycle, then I took 300 units of Follistim and 75 unit vials of Menopur for 10 days along with 250 mcg/0.5mL syringes of Ganirelix for the last 6 days. I used two Lupron trigger shots at the end. My egg retrieval took place 2 days later resulting in 22 eggs of which 18 were mature. From there we were able to get 12 embryos, which were fertilized via ICSI, and 8 made it on to Day 5 blastocysts. We froze and genetically tested all 8 of those embyros and found 5 were normal, 1 was abnormal, and 1 was unclear. During my whole retrieval cycle I had about 8 monitoring visits. I'm currently in the middle of my transfer cycle and haven't started medications yet, but we plan to transfer 1 of the normal embryos.

We transferred one embryo. During my transfer cycle I took 2mg of Estrace (2-3 times per day) for three weeks before the transfer and then five weeks after. I also injected 1 - 1.5 mL of progesterone in oil daily for a week before the transfer and five weeks after. And I used Metronidazole the day before transfer and Endometrin 100mg inserts around weeks 5-8 of my pregnancy. In total I had about 8 monitoring visits leading up to the transfer and through week 8 of my pregnancy. My protocol was very simple. Gonal-f, menopur, cetrotide, trigger, and estradiol. They increased it accordingly. I luckily have a surplus of follicles so stimming was quite easy. We used menopur, gonal f and cetrotide. We never went over 225 of menopur or 300 Gonal f.  We used growth hormone once.  
My first cycle was a typical antagonist protocol because I have PCOS. They expected me to overproduce so they started me on lower doses. However, my body wasn’t responding in the way they had expected. I produced 19 eggs, 16 mature, 12 fertilized with ICSI, and only 2 survived to 6-day blast. Luckily both were PGS normal but Dr. Treiser encouraged us to let her try another cycle to see if we could get better results and bank more, higher quality embryos since we do want more than one child. Our insurance covers IVF and allows banking so we decided to do a second cycle. 

We did a Lupron down-regulation protocol the second time. Dr. Treiser felt she had learned about my body in the first cycle and that with the Lupron cycle, she could have more control over how my body would react. We retrieved 24 eggs, 21 mature, 19 fertilized, and 14 made it to day 6 blast. 11/14 were PGS normal. We were so happy we trusted her to do a second cycle. 

I am currently 18w5d pregnant with my first transfer of our best quality female. My partner and I had a terrible experience at our former clinic. We had 20 frozen eggs thawed---and only 30 percent of those eggs survived.  In addition, at the former clinic I also underwent a retrieval and obtained 8 eggs. Out of 11 embryos (from the frozen eggs and fresh cycle), none grew to day 5!  Dr. Hong explained that she strongly believed this poor result was due to lab error as well as poor trigger shot timing on behalf of my former RE, but she couldn't be 100 percent sure. Well, she was right!  In this cycle we had 6 fertilized embryos and 4 grew to blastocyst stage and 3 were biopsied.  We are currently waiting for those results.  She doesn't guarantee any will be normal (based on my age), but she timed the trigger shot earlier in order to optimize quality. She also tweaked my medication protocol (raised dose of gonal f to 300 from 225 and raised dose of menopur from 75 to 150 as well as added omnitrope) in order to ensure embryos grew at a faster rate.I don't remember the specific dosages. I did 2 retrieval cycles (menpopur, goal F, ganirelix) with HCG and lupron for trigger. We did ICSI And PGS due recurrent pregnancy lost. We did two retrieval cycles for the purpose of storing embryos for the future. We did a single 6 day embryo frozen transfer which stuck. I'm currently 12 weeks. Fingers crossed. I am 33 years old; on my initial visit, my AMH was 0.29 and there were 3 follicles seen when I went for my initial consultation appointment.  I was surprised to learn I actually had DOR.  I was on the antagonist protocol and was on a high dose level of medication and took my trigger shot on the 10th day of treatment.  I was solely relying on him and his judgement and was extremely fortunate and happy to have 7 eggs retrieved and 6 frozen.We went for IUI before IVF because we were unexplained infertility. We also did IUI with clomid instead of injections because we were completely out of pocket and she explained Dr. Morris explained that the meds could be a lot more expensive and the odds of getting pregnant weren't that much higher.Because of our fertility obstacles, Dr. Forman said that both IVF and IUI were reasonable options. He weighed the pros and cons of both treatments with us considering our long term family planning goals. Ultimately we decided to do IVF considering my age and our desire to have multiple children in the future. 

We completed our egg retrieval and opted for CCS testing to test our embryos chromosomes at day 5 after fertilization. All embryos were frozen at this point. About a month later we did a tansfer with one of our normal embryos. We did the standard transfer protocol which included progesterone injections and a timed transfer. Unfortunately this transfer did not work. 

Dr. Forman reached out to us immediately to discuss strategies going forward. Our next transfer a month later involved the natural approach. It is still medicated, but relies on the body's natural cycle. Dr. Forman felt like I was a good candidate for this option that isn't always the first line of treatment.

Our second transfer worked and we are now in our second trimester! Each step of the way Dr. Forman gave us all of our options and let us make our own decisions. Every time we made a decision we felt confident going forward because of the information provided by Dr. Forman.I had two IUI attempts using Follistim and Ganirelex.  Dr. Forman counseled us that I had no anatomic issues that we couldn't try IUI first, although he told us IVF had better outcomes.  I insisted on trying IUI first because was less invasive and required less monitoring.  Unfortunately they didn't work and we moved onto IVF.  My first egg retrieval yielded 6 eggs and 4 embryos, however all four were not chromosomally normal or acceptable for a transfer.  One was a mosaic which in the past evidently were sometimes used but Dr. Forman advised me against it unless it was my only option.  He assured me that sometimes this can occur and that he has seen women go on to have future egg retrievals and embryos that are healthy.  Although I was devastated and frustrated with the process at this point as it was going on almost 8 months of fertility treatment, I agreed to try again, giving myself a month off to regroup. My final cycle and egg retrieval (which was on Christmas Day and we are convinced blessed as a result :) ) yielded about 6 eggs and we had four healthy embryos!!!!  We did ICSI and had all the advanced genetic chromosomal testing done and decided to transfer our male embryo the end of February.  On March 6th I finally received the news that we were praying for  . .. .  I was pregnant!!!!  I am now 16 weeks and 4 days and all going well!  Bloodwork and early anatomy scan normal.  We couldn't be happier.micro flare with HGHWe tried to use the embryos that were generated when I was with a previous doctor. However, after two failed transfers, we did a retreival with RMANJ and Dr. Hock believes that the egg quality will be better. I have also adjusted my diet for several months, which should help egg quality and will hopefully result in a successful transfer.We are waiting to move forward until we find out if we are able to retrieve my husband's sperm through MESA or TESE.  She said to call her the very next day and let her know so we can proceed!  She decided to hold off on doing a big workup on me, after all the testing I had already been through, because we are OOP and the course of treatment/testing would be completely different for IVF/ICSI or IUI with donor sperm or foster-adopt.  If we are able to find sperm to freeze, we will evaluate me and proceed with a freeze-all cycle with ICSI and PGS.  Since we would like to transfer all normal embryos, she definitely recommended the PGS so that we don't have the cost and heartache of unnecessary losses, and FET to give my body a break in between ER/transfer cycles.  As far as waiting after a successful pregnancy to do each subsequent transfer, she explained that the wait can be a little longer after C-section vs. vaginal delivery, to prevent uterine rupture.We did a estrogen priming cycle for retrieval with Follistim, Novadril,, Garnirelix, low dose hcg and lupron trigger.  ICSI was a must for us with our primary infertility issue was male factor morphology.  My first transfer was a medicate cycle with was unsuccessful, so for frozen transfer #2 we did a natural cycle and it was a success.   Following the same protocol for this round as well. I have had 1 egg retrieval and 6 IVF cycles:
IVF cycle 1- 5 day single  FET, estrace 3 x day, PIO 5 days before transfer
1 D&C
IVF cycle 2- 5 day single FET, estrace 3 x day, PIO 5 days before transfer, benadryl 3 x day

For IVF we started with menopur and gonal F in the morning (75 of menopur and 150 of gonal F pen) and at night.  On the 3rd morning I had to start the ganarelix one injection and did that as well for the next 5 mornings along with the other meds.  After the 3rd morning I went to monitoring the 5th day, 6th, and 8th day of meds.  Then I did a trigger shot that night of hcg 5,000units and lupron that twice that day.  These meds produced 7 eggs, only 3 were mature and only 1 made it to blast.We tried different stims (follistim ended up being the one we stuck with) and different triggers (stuck with ovidrel after an injection site reaction to the other) to see what went better.  We adjusted the dosage rate for the first few IUI cycles until we got it right.  We tried and then abandoned progesterone suppositories after a bad reaction one month.  We talked about non-prescription supplementation as well.  I have reacted very well to the follistim and ovidrel - our problem now seems to be my husband's sperm.  He referred my husband to a urologist for assessment and supplements. I had an antagonist protocol twice. Had to do with my PCOS. Triggered first retrieval with pregnyl and second time with novarel. Had ICSI, PGS, and assisted hatching. Had two miscarriages for a chromosomal issue. Was genetically screened and just having ""bad luck"" and the testing can't pick it up or prevent it. Hoping third transfer (preparing now) will work. 3 IUI's, 1st round with clomid then switched brands to Letrozole
1 IVF round after unsuccessful IUIs, were doing fresh transfer and was told 1 day before that they were freezing them instead to give them 1 more day to advance
After miscarrying with IVF, insurance only covered IUIs. 
Although they were not successful, they were covered by insurance and we did 4 cycles.
First round with Letrozole and developed vertigo like symptoms, we switched to injectables.
Unsuccessful 4 IUIs to follow.For IUI: Gonal-F at varying levels (between 100-150 most times) depending on follicle growth, then 1Ovidrel for trigger each time. We did not have any successful IUI cycles, however.
I was also advised to go on a low-carb diet as Dr. Shastri diagnosed me with symptoms similar to PCOS.For egg retrieval medication, I dont exactly remember.

For FET, it was estrogen, Progesterone oil, Doxycyclin and Madrol.Our first three IVF cycles were traditional cycles with 1 embryo transfer.  Dr. Forman had suggested transferring 2, but I was nervous about twins so we proceeded based on my comfort.  We used the typical medications of progesterone in oil injections and estrogen.  The final cycle was a non-traditional cycle where he created more of a natural cycle and implanted the embryo when my own body was ready to receive it.  Medications were similar to the traditional cycles and continued through the first 8 to 10 weeks of pregnancy.Due to my age and the fact that I had good insurance coverage, he recommended we go right to IVF rather than trying IUI. After my first egg collection I had severe abdominal cramping and so with my second egg collection he changed the “trigger “ Med to Lupron and I felt fine after the collection. Letrozol and a double IUI after testing. Bloodwork at day 3 and day 11 to make sure I am progressing. Chlomid was unsuccessful 4x and this is what we are trying before proceeding to IVF.I had my son on my 2nd IUI using chlomid.  I tried 14 more IUIs, first with chlomid, then with injectibles for Baby #2.  Now I am in my 2nd IVF cycle with injectibles. After reviewing the percentage of successful birth with IUI compared IVF it only seemed to make sense to do the IVF since it had such a higher rate of success even though it was more invasive. Looking back now on the second cycle we did which we started as an IVF but switched are you why because my follicles were not growing properly seems like kind of a waste of moneyDr. Forman was careful to not hyperstimulate my ovaries. His main concern was quality not quantity. I started with Folistim injections followed by Ganirelix and eventually a trigger shot. He was aiming for 15 quality eggs and we got exactly that.I can't remember, but Dr.Foreman will taylor a plan for youAlthough I do not recall the specific cycles used, or drug dosages (which are all patient specific), I do remember that my first cycle did not result in an egg retrieval. Dr Forman advised me to stop the cycle and utilize a different protocol.  While I was initially upset, it made sense not to spend the money when I would not have gotten the eggs needed for a transfer. I appreciated Dr Forman's honesty. Antagonist protocol due to low egg reserve.I feel that the protocol used was a standard protocol for someone whose already been pregnant naturally in my age group.  Evaluation of both myself and husband. Diagnosis and treatment of potential infertility causes.  Egg retrevial, icsi, culture to day 5, day 5 pgd testing, freezing ofpotential embryos and waiting for results.  I am no expert but I believe this is typical.I came to Dr. Forman from a different fertility clinic where I had one egg retrieval, which led to OHSS, and zero eggs to transfer. Due to the OHSS resulting from the egg retrieval at the other center, Dr. Forman modified the stim meds and protocol (using less hCG for the trigger), which resulted in a successful egg retrieval (performed by him) and absolutely no OHSS - it was night and day, the differences between the two retrievals. We had 3 CCS-tested normal embryos and we were thrilled.

We transferred one of those embryos, but because of scheduling issues on our part, Dr. Forman did not perform that frozen embryo transfer. That embryo did not lead to a pregnancy, and we were getting very nervous about our future even though it's normal for an embryo not to implant. Dr. Forman spoke to us on the phone for a good 30 minutes and discussed our options and what could be done differently to try to improve our chances for the 2nd embryo. He suggested I get a hysteroscopy and D&C to make sure my uterine lining is healthy. They found that there was mild inflammation, and so an antibiotic was prescribed for 10 days to clear it. Dr. Forman also suggested that he perform the transfer this time because he is familiar with the structure of my uterus, which is definitely tilted.

When it came time for the 2nd frozen embryo transfer, Dr. Forman was there and walked us through everything. He explained what was being done the entire time, and although it was a bit challenging due to the bend in my uterus, he successfully transferred the embryo, and now I am 10 weeks pregnant!150 units of Gonal F, 300 units of menopur and then added ganarelix in on day 5. Stimmed for 8 days and was able to retrieve 19 eggs! Since Dr. Molinaro completely disagreed with the first treatment I had done at another clinic, he decided to bypass any sort of pill treatment (Clomid. Letrozole).  He also explained to me why they probably wouldn't work for me anyway.  We decided to do 3 IUI cycles with injectible medications (Gonal-F).  After the second one, we weren't sure what step to take next.  Dr. Molinaro did not tell us what to do, but instead helped guide our decision to try one more round of IUI before moving onto IVF.
Once we decided to go to IVF, Dr. Molinaro sat down and had an in-depth conversation with me and my husband describing how the whole cycle would go, how long it would take, etc.  He answered all of our questions, both in the office and via e-mail.  He explained why FET would work better for me than a fresh transfer, as well as transferring only 1 embryo at a time, so that is the route we took.  Our first egg retrieval and (1)frozen egg transfer were both successful, resulting in a pregnancy with 1 baby boy due in January 2017.  We have 2 frozen embryos that we plan on transferring one at a time in the future.I did not get my period on my own, so we started the cycle with Provera and then 14 days of BCP. After the fourth day of being off BCP, I started stimming using Follistim and Menopur, with doses changing based on blood work and ultrasound. After 4 days, I added Ganirelex. For my trigger, 36 hours before retrieval, I used 2mL Pregnyl and 40 units Lupron, and then 24 hours prior I used 40 units Lupron again. This retrieval yielded 36 eggs, 23 matured, 16 fertilized, and 10 made it to CCS/PGD. All were normal, 5 girls and 5 boys. 
When we canceled the fresh transfer, I waited for day 1 which came 12 days later. We did day 3 blood work which was all good, and then we waited until the next month to prep for the frozen transfer. After normal ultrasound and bloodwork, I restarted estrogen suppositories, and 18 days after starting this process, was able to have my frozen embryo transfer. This transfer happened on Nov. 29, 2015 and was successful as I am now 32 weeks pregnant with my blessing of a baby boy! I started 1 menopur and 200 Gonal -F on February 1, 2016 for 3 days. It increased to 2 menopur and 225 Follism for 6 days. 2 days before egg retrieval, I used 555iu Pregnyl and 40 iu Leuprolide. Egg retrieval was on February 12, 2016., with 15 eggs retrieved. 14 eggs were mature and 6 embryos survived to day 5. Embryos were tested and ended up with 5 frozen embryos. On March 22, 2016, I started medrol, doxycycline, and progesterone shots. One embryo was transferred March 27th, 2016. Positive pregnancy test on April 5, 2016. Last day of progesterone shots was May 4, 2016 and endometrin gel was used for 14 days. Currently 15 weeks pregnant. I don't recall all of the protocol details. What I do remember is even if he was out he would still review my test results and recommend any changes if needed.  The first one was a natural cycle.he mentioned I could participate in the study. After 2 failed egg retriveal cycles where I got no good embryos he mentioned that it is believed that naturally some woman can produce perfectly normal embryos. We tried and we obtained 1 perfect normal embryo (PGD normal)
After 2 failed transfers of PGD normal embryos he suggested again to do a ERA a test that determines the receptivity of uterine linen. He shared the research from the clinic insm Spain and also explained very well how it woukd work and was also very transparent of the potentisl results and how it's not normal practice and RMA so it was purely experimental, but his rationale, which I share and agree is that I would not be loosing anything, besides just the money for the test, which we were willing to pay after evrything we had been through. And the results were absolutely amazing as thanks to that I'm  today 12 wks pregnant. I put a lot of trust in Dr. Forman and his trusted his professional  knowledge as to which medications I should be on. He never put me on more medication that I needed, and would advise me when to stop taking certain medications.It was our 4th retrieval, only 1st with Dr Forman so he thoroughly reviewed all of our info from our prior clinic and adjusted a couple things:
Birth control to start 
Estradiol
Menopur and follistim
Progesterone injections We were lucky to be chosen to be in the NexGen IVF study, so once we had embryos from the study our only game plan was to do another IVF FET. My last cycle we “pulled out all the guns” with a Benadryl protocol, use of probiotics, and baby aspirin. I was gluten and dairy free for 6 months prior to my successful cycle although Dr. Molinaro said he didn’t feel this was the big difference between this cycle and my past failures. I had an extra 2 days of estrogen priming before my transfer and when it was time for progesterone, I used suppositories as well as injections to keep my progesterone levels as high as possible. I had a D and C done a few months prior as well to rule out polyps or inflammation/infection. I don't remember specific dosages.. one thing that I remember was discussing whether or not I would have to use progesterone injections 2 weeks prior to transfer, up until 8 weeks of pregnancy.  I would have liked not to use injections since they were painful.  We were discussing the use of progesterone suppositories, but in the end, Dr Ryback wanted me to use the injections since we had not determined my ovulation cycle or if I was ovulating at all.  He felt that the progesterone injections would be my best bet after transfer.I USED GONAL F  FOR AN IUI CYCLE.
I WAS CONFUSED BECAUSE AT THE CONSULT, I WAS TOLD THEY WANTED TO START ON A HIGH DOSE, AND GO FROM THERE. TYPICALLY, I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN STARTED ON A LOW DOSE BECAUSE OF MY PCOS, AND TENDANCY TO HYPERSTIMULATE. WHEN I GOT MY INSTRUCTIONS THE FIRST DAY, IT WAS BEGIN AT 75 IU, WHICH IS LOW.
WHEN I QUESTIONED IT, I WAS TOLD THE INSURANCE WOULDN'T ALLOW ME TO BE STARTED HIGHER. 
SO IT SEEMS THEY REALLY FOLLOW THINGS TO THE LETTER OF THE LAW OVER THERE.....
IT WAS A REGULAR IUI CYCLE, REGULAR INJECTIONS FOR ABOUT 2 AND HALF WEEKS, FOLLOWED BY A TRIGGER SHOT, AND ONE IUI.
THIS CYCLE ENDED IN A NEGATIVE PREGNANCY TESTThree rounds of IUI using clomid and donor sperm.  The third IUI resulted in an ectopic pregnancy.  It was then that Dr Morris suggested IVF.  
The first round of IVF resulted in all my embryos arresting.  Because of that, Dr Morris put me on a micro-flare cycle.  I was able to get one 5-day blast.  (That ""blast"" is now sleeping on my lap).  My plan was to do a fresh single embryo transfer which resulted in a pregnancy. I had a successful fresh transfer before which is why he recommended trying it again.  After initial testing I was placed on thyroid medication then followed the recommended IVF injections.  We discovered in our in take testing that our primary issue was male factor (Varicocele) that resulted in us going directly to IVF.  There was also a concern of diminished ovarian reserve, due to my sister going through pre-ovarian failure at 29 years old, and some minor endometriosis.  When our first retrieval (follistim, menopur and ganirellix) resulted in 3 (normal PGS tested) embryos, but Dr. Forman knew we wanted 3 or more children, we opted to do a second retrieval before transferring any.  Our second retrieval (same protocol) yielded 5 (normal PGS tested embryos). 

We later did an FET with our highest graded embryo that unfortunately resulted in a failure.  We believe it was due to a rare catheter insertion issue due to my anatomy ( I have a severely tipped uterus and it made the transfer challenging)

Dr. Forman insisted on doing my second transfer himself after doing a couple of trial runs.  The second transfer was still challenging, again just due to my anatomy, but worked this time!  Unfortunately, the embryo split on it's own and resulted in a loss of identical twins at 8 weeks.  This was likely due to twin/twin transfusion and nothing to do with IVF.

For our third transfer, Dr. Forman again insisted on doing the transfer himself, but also recommended doing so under anesthesia.  (This is something rarely done, but given my anatomy, he was looking to knock that out as a potential variable)  It worked!  We are currently 15 weeks pregnant with our miracle from Dr. Forman, and look forward to using him in the future for siblings.  I would absolutely recommend him to someone pursuing fertility treatments!We did high-stim ivf micro-flare protocols with human growth hormone. They were freeze-all cycles wherein we tested the embryos and followed with FETs of euploid blastocysts.We used a donor egg and were given a cycle of Progesterone Oil injections with Estrogen oral pills for about 8 weeks and then transferred to Endometrin suppositories for a week.   I remember not responding well to one of the medications that was used to help the embryo implant.  For the next cycle, he agreed that I should try it naturally (without medication).  That cycle proved to be the successful one.  Dr. Forman encouraged me to do a saline sonogram before proceeding with the cycle to make sure my tubes were clear.  Unfortunately I have little recollection of details but every treatment strategy and protocol seemed to make perfect sense.  We ended up having success with our first IVF cycle (after  IUIs). With my anovulation, I took menopur to help follicle(s) grow. Then I'd use an HCG trigger shot (the brand varied) to trigger ovulation. I then used endometrin progesterone tablets until I was about 10 weeks pregnant. If I remember right, that's all I took during the cycles. In all but one cycle, the menopur worked to grow follicle(s).We did a frozen embryo cycle from a donor cycle, so I was on whatever protocol that would be. I first did a prep cycle to make sure my lining reached the requisite thickness before anything even began. I am also on levothyroxine, a thyroid medicine, as my TSH level was a bit elevated. This is a protocol I will continue to the end of the pregnancy. I believe I was on estrace before and then after the transfer. After the transfer I was on injectable progesterone until many weeks in to the pregnancy but stopped before moving to the ob/gyn. IVF with CCS, because I was diagnosed with a balanced translocation of chromosomes 11 and 18. Frozen cycles to allow for testing. After failed embryo transfer, Dr. recommended endometrial biopsy. Results negative. Presence of cyst delayed transfer, so an endometrial disruption was scheduled. Waiting for day one of cycle to start frozen transfer cycle.I have a blocked tube that could have been treated through other methods but the doctor suggested to go forward directly with IVF given my limited insurance allowance. I'm still in the middle of the process but hoping for positive results.We agreed to move forward with an IUI strategy. Through Dr. Jurema and RMA we completed one Hysterosalpingogram, which revealed that my left fallopian tube was stretched and taught, but otherwise fine. Dr. Jurema explained that we could complete further testing to determine if it was endometriosis or we could move ahead with the IUI as sometimes it's possible that a woman's natural anatomy can be a cause. We opted to move forward with IUI only, no further testing.
We completed two IUIs, each with a round of Letrozole (alternative to Clomid) and a trigger shot (hcg). On the second IUI cycle we also had to take a second trigger shot. Unfortunately I do not remember the doses.
Both cycles resulted in negative pregnancy tests.I do not remember the protocol at all but the results were a healthy and strong  baby girl and 9 embryos in the freezer.  First we did 3 IUI cycles using clomid. Our first IUI resulted in a pregnancy which turned out to be an ectopic pregnancy. Dr. Doherty monitored me very closely when he suspected  ectopic pregnancy and discussed best management which was methotrexate. He explained all the risks and benefits before administering medications. 2 days after receiving medication , I walked into office bc I wasn't feeling well and Dr. Doherty determined that I needed surgery for removal of the ectopic pregnancy . He called the day after he performed the surgery to check in and see how I was feeling. We continued with 2 more IUI cycles which resulted in negative pregnancy tests. First IVF cycle was done in January 2015 which resulted in 13 eggs retrieved, 5 eggs were mature and 2 fertilized resulting in 2 embryos but only 1 grew and a 3 day transfer was done. That resulted in a twin pregnancy which ended at 10 weeks due to genetic abnormalities.  Second IVF cycle was down regulation cycle. This results in 27 eggs retrieved 21 were mature and fertilized  using ICSI. 14 embryos made it to days 5 and all were tested using CCS. 7 embryos were normal and frozen. I developed mild ovarian hyper stimulation . Dr. Doherty knew this was a possibility and monitored me very closely. From that cycle  which took place June 2015, first transfer done in August 2015 which resulted in negative pregnancy. Second transfer done in October 2015 which resulted in birth of our daughter June 13, 2016.Because of my age 44 years old - We chose to do In Vitro Fertilization, Comprehensive Chromosome Screening, Intra-Cytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) and a Single Embryo Transfer.  We did the stimulation, egg retrieval and a five day fresh embryo transfer.  I also did the acupuncture immediately after the transfer.  It resulted in a successful pregnancy and I now have a healthy, beautiful baby girl!  Nothing special.  Started with low dose of follistim and raised it until he was happy with the maturity of the follicles.  Estridol and progesterone.I do not remember the specifics (mix of hormones, etc.)We went through three full cycles - one additional cycle was cancelled.  I was monitored for bloodwork and hormone levels and spoke to a nurse about protocols regularly.  I received injections of Follistim, Menopur, Lupron and I'm not sure what the other drugs were without going back to my records.  I also took Endometrin orally.We did Icsi with PGD testing. Lupron and ganarelix protocol. We live out of town and we were able to adjust implantation based on my work schedule. 
Dr. Forman recommended single embryo transfer and I'm thrilled we did. We have a healthy baby girl. I don't remember too many specifics at this point... But we did the injections every night (Follisitm, Menupor) for about a week. Did a retrieval and had PGD testing. The result of the first retrieval was disappointing with a low number and 2 embryos ( 1 clean and one a carrier for CF). Did another round which resulted in zero viable embryos. He was ready to start again but we went ahead with a FET  from the first cycle. After we had our initial meeting and tests, Dr.  Forman suggested we go right for IVF since our issue warranted that.   He didn't want us to do things that he didn't think would work.   
After I had a few embryos transferred and none of them made it to a full term baby, Dr. Forman suggested we do another egg retrieval and then test those fresh eggs instead of testing my eggs that were frozen from my first retrieval.  If we unfroze, tested,  and then refroze,  there was a chance some of the embryos wouldn't make it.  I had one egg retrieval, ICSI, one fresh and one frozen embryo transfers.  For me, the fresh transfer resulted in a positive pregnancy but the beta levels did not rise enough to maintain pregnancy so I needed methotrexate since it did not implant in uterus. For my frozen transfer (performed by Dr Forman), I received a positive result and everything progressed normally. I graduated the clinic at 8 weeks and I am currently 33 weeks pregnant.  It's so funny how quickly you forget which is why I would go and do it all again (and plan to). I do not recall exact protocols from the retrieval process but I do remember taking estrace, that lovely Progesterone in oil (intramuscular injection), and the vaginal inserts as I reached 10 weeks. The estrace helped get my lining ready and the PIO injection helped support my baby until placenta was there (about 10 weeks I stopped that and switched to vaginal insert). He ow;d not even put me on Clomid - the standard beginning drug of IVF.  (I later had good results with it)1 cycle on Clomid.  IUI w/ Ovidrel trigger.  3 mature follicles but thin-ish lining.  Negative pregnancy test.

3 cycles with Follistim injections (doses between 25 - 100 units; MOSTLY 75 units).  IUI w/ Ovidrel trigger.  Each cycle was 3 or 4 mature follicles.  Negative pregnancy test.

1 Fresh IVF cycle.  10 days BC pills.  Antagonist cycle began with Follistim 75 and 1 vial of Menopur for 9 days; On the 6th day added Ganirelix for 4 days.  The next day did 1/2 dose of Pregnyl at night and 40IU of Lupron.  12 hours later exactly, did another 40IU of Lupron.  Retrieval was timed for the following day and transfer was 6 days later.

On the IVF cycle we did ICSI with PGD so we could have the best possible outcomes.  My last monitoring ultrasound showed 25 follicles.  22 mature eggs were retrieved and 15 fertilized properly with ICSI.  By the day of our transfer - there were 9 blasts.  We transferred 1 blast and are currently pregnant with identical twins.

I did acupuncture throughout all cycles above.  Additionally, had laser acupuncture on the day of transfer immediately before and after the transfer.We used the Antagonist Protocol, although I don't really know his rationale for using them.  I pretty much put my faith in that he knew what he was doing.  Some of the injectables we used were ... Follistim AQ, Menopur, Ganirelix, Ovidrel.  I always produced a good amount of eggs, just not necessarily PGD normal ones.We used the Microdose Lupron Flare protocol with a high dosage of stimulation medication. At my first clinic they used a very standard protocol even though I had a low number of follicles. We only got 5 eggs and the quality wasn’t good. We were almost cancelled and had to have my meds upped 4-5 times. Dr. Shastri was aggressive right off the bat. She said she was going to get me 10 eggs and I told her there was no way. I got 11 eggs and 6 great quality embryos. We transferred two and both stuck. I lost one of them early on, but the other became my son. We had male factor infertility.  Due to no sperm count, my husband had surgery to extract the sperm.  Dr. Hong discussed our options and we agreed the best option would be to do IVF with ICSI. We transferred two embryos which resulted in the live birth of our beautiful twin daughters.I had 2 IUI's done first since egg quality was not of a concern. Both were unsuccessful. I then went trough an egg retrieval where we had the opportunity to freeze one embryo. We had icsi and pgd testing. The next month we transferred the embryo using a natural cycle and became pregnant. Unfortunately, at absolutely no fault of RMA I had a stillbirth at 37 weeks due to placenta and umbilical cord problems. About 6 months later I had another egg retrieval where I used a regiment of vitamins to help improve egg quality and hgh injections to increase egg quantity. I sucessfully had 14 eggs retrieved 13 embryos and 2 frozen blastocysts. We attempted one more retrieval as part of a banking package. My medications were slightly changed this time around. One more blastocyst was frozen from this retrieval. I then had an embryo transfer using a natural cycle and laser acupuncture, resulting in a pregnancy and live birth of a beautiful, healthy baby girl.Probably should have kept a log here but after an uninspiring first cycle, he recommended a down reg protocol and it was very successful. We needed to constantly monitor estrogen levels as they were getting very high but the end result was a safe extraction followed by PGD. The injections were menopur and gonal f between 100 and 150.We started with injectibles. He did recommend we go straight to IVF. I knew he was right because my husbands sperm count, mobility and morphology were all low. But my insurance covered IUIs so we did those until we maxed out (4 cycles). We then did a natural ivf cycle, it was all completely free. He said chances would work with a singleton pregnancy but it also had low chances of working because it wasn’t a medicated cycle. Unfortunately I didn’t have an egg in the one follicle I produced that cycle. After that we went straight to ivf. I remember worrying that I was getting enough follicles and dr Kim listened to my concerns looked at all the monitoring reports and in the end I had a great retrevial. 19 collected, 15 were mature, 14 fertilized and 8 in total after GENETIC testing. we did 3 IUI's and 2 rounds of IVF.  Initially, I was on clomid, but I got visual effects, so I was switched to Femara. We had a sperm issue, so the iui didnt work. 

The first IVF yielded 2 good embryos (I have pcos, so even w a lot of eggs, they weren't all mature).  We did a fresh transfer, but it didn't work. 

She changed the protocol to a feeeze all and added in HGH.  I ended up with 4 embryos. Two were transferred and two were kept frozen (one was a 6 day embryo). The changes to the protocol (HGH  and stimming for longer) yielded me more embryos. I did get some mild OHSS, but that was expected, hence we planned for a freeze all.  I don't remember my protocol but I remember she said slow and steady wins. I stimmed for a while to produce great mature eggs. I used bravelle menopur and ganierelix. I stimmed for about 10 days. She wanted to retrieve less eggs so I didn't get hyperstimulated too. She recommended a freeze all and a FET the next month after an endo scratch a few days after retrieval.We started with the micro dose lupron flare protocol.  It resulted in 3 embryos which was my only successful retrieval. Dr. Kim said he would not consider putting two embryos in me. Flat out told me I was little and I have had a previous fibroid removal sergury. I am glad he recommended this. He also recommended testing of the embryos since before I began with him I had 3 losses in a row. This was also awesome! Our transfer was successful using the tested embryos and we were able avoid possible implanting two translocation embryos that would have resulted in miscarriage.Dr. Morris prescribed high dosages of pills, extra supplements including prenatal and high dosages of follistem. She wanted to get my follicles grow faster. I was lucky to have ten growing but during retrievals, they were all zero eggs retrieved. It is rare they say. I hear this all the time....if you stimulate high dosage, risks are no eggs will be retrieved. I just found out lately. Honestly, it was years ago, and I've put it out of my mind. I can tell you that he changed what was not working from my previous clinic, and was able to lead me to successful pregnancies twice. He looks at the specifics of YOUR case. My meds and protocol won't be the same as yours, because we are different people will different issues, who react differently to different medications.I had a antagonist protocol but when implabtation didnt occur, she brought up the idea of an edometrial biopsy to make sure my lining was optimal. When antibiotics didnt work, we did a suction D&C and got a fresh lining. It became standard in my protocol. I asked about HUMAN GROWTH HORMONE to get my embryos to blasts. She said there was research that it worked in some, but no corrolation to those it did. It was costly, but if i wanted to try it, she was up for it. She was always open to my suggestions.- Weekly blood work
- Weekly ultrasound
- Daily email communication with the support staff including nurse and finance dept.
- 3x a day shots
-  prep for suggery
- Communication with doctor before surgery and communication with doctor afterI responded well to the lowest dose of clomid so we went that route along with an ovidrel trigger and double insemination. Was not as aggressive with the stims as our other doctor. Pushed us to do the ICSI but that turned out not to show anything. In my first ultrasound it was seen there was a tubal blockage and surgery was recommended. That’s now complete and I lost both tubes in the procedure so we are proceeding with IVF. I was on Leupron Microdose protocol! With 300 Gobal F and 150 MenopurI'm approaching the start of my first cycle. I've been in for several rounds of bloodwork and ultrasounds. My meds include estrace, follium, menopur, ganirelix, lupron. I was added to the Prov-et study. I will be starting my first IVF round next month.I am still a pretty new patient at the practice so far I have had an extensive bloodwork completed, an endometrial biopsy and a retrieval. So far my retrieval resulted in 18 eggs of which only 11 were fertilized. This has been my lowest number so far so I am a bit concerned about that. This has been my easiest recovery from the retrieval as I have hyperstimilated in the past.I did two back to back IUI cycles using Follistim to help. The first process resulted in a chemical pregnancy, but he discovered my thyroid was reacting to the medication. I took 1 month off to see an endocrinologist and get on medication to help stabilize. After my blood test showed it lowered, we tried another cycle of IUIs. I’m currently 13 weeks with a healthy pregnancy.Retrieval follistim, and menopur 150 II for egg stimulation every night for 8 days and Pregnyl 10,000 USA for trigger. Blood work and UA every other day. 8 eggs retrieved 4 to blastocyst and 1 genetically normal and frozen for reciprocal ivfFor retrieval, gonal f, cetrotide, low dose hcg
For transfer progesterone suppositories I used a few different injections to stimulate my ovaries as much as possible. Went in for morning monitoring very often. Waiting for this at the moment. So far I’ve had one cycle and there hasn’t been much to adjust.  We did have one setback with a cyst starting this transfer cycle but it was quickly taken care of. I had two surgical procedures (2 hysteroscopy), egg retrieval and one frozen day 5 transfer resulting in a successful pregnancy. It took a little longer because we had difficulty thickening my lining which resulted in Dr. Rauch trying some different protocols to get to the desired thickens so the embryo could implant. Gluten/dairy free diet; IVF protocol targeted for high ovarian reserve with risk of overstimming; probiotics, prebiotics, folate I don't remember the specifics of my protocol.I'm a healthy woman in my early 30s. Because of the cost of donor sperm we decided to do medicated cycles with back to back IUI. Clomid to grow more than 1 follicle. Ovidrel to more perfectly time ovulation. Back to back IUIs to more perfectly time ovulation.I would go in on day 3 of cycle for bloodwork and ultrasound.
I would start my follistum then. Normally 100 iu 
I would go for bloodwork ultrasound for a couple days until they told me to use my ovidril trigger shot. 
Then I would do 2 back to back days of iui.  
Would go back a couple days later to check levels. I would normally be put on progesterone since I seem to always have an issue w that. 
14 days after iui I would go in for pregnancy test.
Given my age, AMH, and TSH levels, we pursued an aggressive treatment plan. He helped me keep my expectations reasonable during the process. Based on the results of my first egg retrieval and his recommendations,  I am in the process of another cycle. We did a max dose for ivf#4 since I didn't have a good response my last cycle. We did a natural cycle to rule out some suspicions about drug interactions. Then we adjusted meds to do a low dose injectable with femera to avoid raising estrogen levels too high. That protocol did the trick for us. She did my last 2 FET's the same protocol using estrogen and progesterone with medrol and doxycycline. I have responded great both times. Though the last ended badly she did achieve pg with that protocol. Im currently awaiting beta from my last FET. we did 2 cycles together. they consisted of follistim and menopur. I was against the use of BC and dr scott allowed me not to use itIVF protocol with menopur and gonal-f, ganirellix. FET protocol with estrace and PIO. 6 embryos frozen as day 6 blasts. No fresh transferred. Currently in the beginning of FET protocol. To many to describe to be honest..but the best, although painful,  was the ERA test. It allows to determine the window of implantation for a personalized embryo transfer. Egg retrieval because of recurring endometriosis.  Frozen embryo transfer because we weren't ready to conceive at the time of the retrieval.We set up appointments to allow for a transfer of frozen embryo. There was a few preliminary appointments of blood work and other necessary testing to make sure the transfer would go smoothly. I had already had two successful ovulation induction cycles from when we lived in London, so Dr. Hock immediately went with the same approach. The first resulted in a chemical pregnancy. The second resulted in triplets who are five years old now! We were not prepared for the high chance of high order multiples from ovulation induction. It was the whole team that came up with the protocol, not just her. It was a short protocol, I stimmed for 9 days before the egg retrieval. I got 17 eggs, 10 fertilized, only two made it to day 5, transferred two, got pregnant with one, ended in 6.5 week miscarriage We used 2 egg stimulants for the retrieval then a drug to stop me from ovulating too early, then the trigger shot. Then once we transfered an egg i was to take progesterone shots to the butt. I don't recall specifics.  The egg donor cycle was successful, but my previous estrogen priming protocol had resulted in embryos that did not make it to transfer.We had to start with clomid as my insurance insisted on that. But, as soon as I failed that cycle, she moved on to the injectable medication as she feels that more effectiveI honestly don’t remember. Recommended medicated IUI due to progressing age, low AMH, and low morphologyWe did IVF with a more aggressive dosing strategy.  As our 5th round, Dr. M was a bit more forward with his approach.Antagonist my first cycle: 2 eggs retrieved. Did not make it to day 6 blastocyst. 
Micro flare the second cycle. 5 eggs retrieved. Three fertilized. All made it to do 5 blastocyst. All tested abnormal. We used an antagonist protocol. I was on 450 follistim with 20 hcg. Adding ganirelix. My trigger was 
.5 pregnyl and 40 lupron 12 hours apartWe will be using donor eggs, not sure what protocol she will use for that donor.Wanted us to start with IUI since we looked good on paper. I did have success with the first medicated one but miscarried. Did a few more and then moved on to ivf. First transfer failed and second ended in miscarriage. Currently awaiting results of 3rd transfer. I did IVF treatment with a egg donor (Spouse). I also did 5 IUI Cycles. which failed. i dont know them of hand  im soory I wish Dr Doherty was always the physician I would see. I did have an IUI with a trigger shot based on an ultrasound someone else did and he even said he would have maybe waited another day. I am doing IUI. First round was completely natural and that resulted in a negative test (although it was slightly elevated so egg may have implanted briefly). Second was with the lightest dose of clomid. I got pregnant but unfortunately had to have a D&C. We have not changed protocol and will be doing an IUI in the next two weeks. I am hopeful for success! Also taking DHEA and COQ10 for egg quality this round.I had 1egg retrieval  (4 eggs retrieved) resulted in 4 embryos. 1st was a fresh transfer resulted in a chemical pregnancy. 2nd was a frozen transfer resulted in a pregnancy. I do not recall those detailsToo much details to remember and write here.
Tried egg retrieval with hormone shots first time.
My choice was to try one more tome
Then on to using donor eggs.We underwent 2 IVF cycles using HGH and the standard fertility medications. In the first cycle we froze 1 day 5 embryo (because of travel) and from the second we transferred a fresh day 5 embryo and froze the remaining 2 day 5 embryos. The fresh transfer resulted in our beautiful son.He only tried two rounds of IUI because of my history. Moving to IVF a bit quicker than normal because he felt IUI may not work. He was right and I guess you could say didn't waist our time.It's been nine years, so I don't recall. Femara because body responded better to that in the past coupled with 2 back to back IUIsFollistim, ovidrel and endometrin suppositories. After a chemical pregnancy of two embryos, an ERA was performed which provided helpful data about the protocol. Double embryo transfer was done twice resulting in one healthy baby. I am currently on medication to level my insulin. I am undergoing letrizol treatment and ovidrel shots with two back to back IUI procedures.I don't remember specifics.Estrace prep, 300 follistim, 150 menopur, 3 days' omnitrope, ganirelexWe are going with embryo donation through RMA our cycle starts this monthIUIS which failed,
IVF which failed because of curved cervix and uterine polyps. I had 2 embryos left and after a hysterosopy and a trail transfer I got pregnant from a FET.We had male factor infertility, so with that she recommended an excellent urologist, who along with Dr. Constanini Ferrando really got us when we had to be I have PCOS so I overstimulate easily, Dr. Molinaro always monitored me closely and would adjust my dosage accordingly because of my situation. Dr. Molinaro had suggested that after several IUI's that never resulting pregnancies that I should try IVF. He said that it would be easier to control for me (IUI's are risky for multiples, especially with my tendency to overstimulate). I was afraid to do it, I also did not have the funds for it and he never pressured me. I would suggest we try another IUI and he would say ok. I finally did the IVF and had twins.  I remember a lot of tests. I took clomid even though it was male factor. They said it helped out chances of a successful IUI. IUI used a handful of times. Because of my age (45)  I did not produce many eggs & he suggested I consider egg donation. Sorry I can not be specific. Both cycles involved injections, donor eggs, and transfers... this was over 10 years agoSo far just clomid We tried to maximize egg quality and quantity. We tried hgh. Finally had success with donor eggs I don't remember lovenox, POI, estrogen...She did not describe my protocol in those terms to me which I did not find necessary at the time. Later as I learned more through research I could tell what my protocol was but I forget now. The protocol seemed to work well for my follicle growth and egg retrieval I did feel that I was sensitive to the hormones mood wise and she claimed it wouldn’t be the meds which I wasn’t convinced but the retrieval and transfer went well so I was pleased with that. Gonal-F, Ganirelix, Menopure. Then Ovidrell and Luprolide for trigger. I Stimmed for 10 nights first round
and 9 nights second round
same protocol just one day less
menopur 
Gonal F
Ganirelix
I can not recall thisWe have tried gonal f, menopur for Retrieval cycle 

Transfer we have tried stimulated cycle and natural cycle. Medrol Benadryl baby aspirin gonal f ovidril estradiol projesterone suppository and project in oil Don’t remember sorryEstrogen priming antagonist with HGH.  Freeze all with CCS testing. I only did an fet with her. For my second egg stimulation, Dr. Fischer changed the dose of Follistim which resulted in a significant higher number of eggs and consequently more fertilized eggs. For my second egg transfer, Dr. Fischer decided to do a synthetic cycle, opposed to a natural cycle, where she could control my ovulation period and resulted in my current pregnancy.Procedures included daily injections, oral medications as needed, and additional medications for specific timeframes. Gonal-F  and ovidrel for IUI’s, Gonal-F and 2 additional medications for retrieval preparation. One FET using progesterone injections and the second (successful) natural cycle with progesterone suppositories.My case was pretty straightforward- the biggest issue was the chromosomal abnormalities leading to my miscarriages. That said we did chromosome testing on the embryos before implanting. We only implanted one embryo at a time and had success. I saw Dr. M one-two times per week once my cycle started. Since I didn't have any hormone issues, Dr. Fischer did a moderate medicine protocol for the egg retrieval and found the perfect balance of quality and quantity. We had 13 eggs and were left with 5 embryos frozen. For the transfer, she decided not to put my body through more than necessary and went with a natural transfer. This followed my body's natural cycle. It can be frustrating when your body takes longer than expected to ovulate following a retrieval but I'm glad we did that because all I took was a trigger shot followed by progesterone suppositories. That transfer took and currently 14 weeks pregnant!I was on a very high dose of one medication for two egg retrievals in a previous office, with limited results. Dr. Molinaro put me on a lower dosage of a combination of medicines, and we saw much better results. We began with clomid and ovidrel for our first two IUI cycles, once the doctor realized that it was not working, she switched us to follistim injections which was showing better results, but still not successful. Endometrium was added and things looked better but still did not stick. I underwent a procedure for polyp removal, then re-tried the follistim, ovidrel, endometrium combination and the very next IUI was a success!We started with clomid, and IUI. It unfortunately did not work so we moved on to another hormone medication. She wanted me to do medicated IUIs because of my husband’s sperm quality. My fourth IUI worked, but unfortunately I miscarried several weeks later. They had me in every 2-3 days for ultrasounds to monitor the baby. From then we have had a few more medicated IUIs but none have worked, with my last cycle being an injectable. Bloodwork which determines egg reserve, estrogen, progesterone, overall health. Sonograms helped me to determine that I had a fibroid that needed to be removed. SA for my husband to determine the health of his semen and what protocol to use to inseminate our eggs. I did 4 IUI cycles in total.  3 were medicated orally coupled with a trigger shot; 3 were unsuccessful.  The fourth cycle we injected Follistim and GonalFD and it was a success!  She had me on follistim injections with an ovadrel trigger shot which worked in stimulating my overuse. I had 3 mature follicles for both IUIs At Rmanj they feel eSet is the way to go. For me it definitely is since I have an abnormal uterus The clinic only does single embryo transfers to keep down the risk of for mother and embryoHe suggested transferring two donor egg embryos but I insisted on eSet.single embryo transferVery high pregnancy rates with this clinic, so eSET seems to be a better option.He definitely prefers an eSETI have not had ivf or transfers yet, that is the next step if this current iui cycle fails.Dr. Hong and the rest of the RMA crew definitely have the mentality of one happy baby at a time.  While she respected my desire for transferring two embryos, she absolutely vocalized that she would prefer one at a time.I believe Dr. Foreman is highly learned in the benefits of single embryo vs multiple embryo transfers. I was and am confident in his method. By getting CCS testing, you pick the healthiest embryo which lowers your chance of a miscarriage and the need to transfer more than one. This is also beneficial since carrying multiples comes with high risks. Dr Molinaro is definitely an advocate of eSET. My last transfer I transferred 2 untested donor embryos as we both knew this was most likely my last transfer attempt, and because I had had so many failures. Also we had a long discussion of the possibility of multiples and I was ok if that happened. I never ever thought it would happen but alas, my one and only successful transfer resulted in twins. My doctor performed single embryo transfers and I agreed with this decision.He advised against multiple embryo transfer saying that it could harm the chances of a successful transfer. Didn’t discuss this The decision was left largely up to my husband and me, but with only two viable embryos left, there was little to consider. We went for both, hoping for at least one positive result, but instead got two incredibly healthy results! My doctor was fairly adamant about transferring two embryos to increase the chances of a baby for the parents. She did not really discuss the risks with me, but the risks were in my records. I am very happy I followed his suggestion of a single transfer. We have gone back and forth between whether we should transfer 1 or 2.
He Didnt Like Multiple Transfers Said It Was High Risk.Dr. Scott prefers to use single embryo transfer.NoneHe recommended a single transfer for me so that i won't have twinsDr. Werner strongly advised eSET becuase multiple embroy transter will increase the risk for both baby and the mother which I agreed.Strong preference for single embryo transfer. I have not done IVF yet, but from my understanding RMA will only transfer 1 embryo.We did single embryo transfer Bc my embryos were tested. I very much admire the fact that she prefers eSET. I understand the risks of multiples and the strain it could have on my body and trust her completely. I feel that all doctors at RMA that I have met with are strongly against multiple embryo transfers.  Yet Ive had 3 failed transfere with pgs tested embryos.  We may consider putting in 2 if my 4th transfer fails. If the doctor says single embryo transfer is what's best, I would follow her protocol. I did not get this far, but she told me she does eSET.No as much as a I wanted multiples transferred at once he reassured me it was not safe due to my age and my body structure.My understanding was the SET was a bit more effective, and that is all my insurance would cover, so a multiple embryo transfer was never really discussed.  Also, given my age, I don't think I would have elected for a multiple embryo transfer.Dr. Hong was very clear from the beginning that we would do a single embryo transfer. I didn't challenge it.No experience hereWith PGS/CCS euploid embryos our clinic transfers one embryo Dr. Drew’s was very strong about transferring only 1 embryo at a time. We went with his recommendation. We are not sure as to what he will do for the next transfer. Even though we only had one embryo to use anyways, I would only choose to do single embryo transfer, but that is my personal opinion.Dr. Yih did discuss the eSET with us but didn't really comment if it was the best solution or not.  I did a lot of research and found that the eSET was actually healthier for the mother not having the stress of carrying multiples and especially because my husband does not want twins. She has a strong preference of single embryo transfer. She will only do multiples in rare cases. My doctor felt that I am young (under 35) and have no fertility issues he felt safe allowing for one egg at a time. I believe at this point we are doing the eighth strategy He recommended a single embryo transfer given my health and age. He told me it was my decision but advised against multiple. He said that would be very risky for me. He said if the single didn’t work, we could reevaluate. Dr. Doherty said he would support our decision either way but said that he would recommend a single embryo transfer. He showed me some research regarding the risks of a single vs multiple embryo transfer. But let me make the ultimate decision and we did decide to go with a single embryo transfer. I think they only trasnfer one embryo at a time.Dr.Morris was pro single embryo transfer. We discussed the pros and cons of single vs transferring two embryos since RMA only transfer at the most two embryos. We decided that single was a better option.I was sure that transferring two embryos would give us the best odds. Dr. Doherty explained in detail the benefits of eSET with my age and BT. We are so glad we took his advice and transferred one embryo. We haven't actually done IVF yet, but we have discussed our approach should we have to move into that.  He is convinced by the studies that show that a single embryo transfers has resulted in more healthy births, so as a general rule he does single transfers, although if there were a reason to do multiple, I don't think there's a hard and fast policy against that.  We had already decided we were only going to do one embryo at a time and did not want to chance twins.  Also out of four attempts of IVF cycles we only ended up with two embryos and decided to transfer them separately anyway. If we had ended up with more embryos I still don't think we would have done multiple transfersDr. Foreman preferred single transfer due to the fact that with multiples it's a higher risk on the babies and the mom. From my own research I agreed to his approach. As an individual with a large fibroid uterus, Dr Forman advised me against have multiple embryos transferred. I had to have an open myomectomy prior to my transfer and all physicians involved did not think it would be wise to carry more than one child. I was well educated on the benefits of eSET and that is for the most part recommended at RMA. However, with my negative results in the past plus my age and diagnosis, Dr. Shastri felt comfortable allowing me to transfer two embryos. Dr. Hong recommended single embryo, however, we decided to transfer two at the same time.  We were comfortable with our decision.Because of my low quality eggs, I only had 1 embryo to transfer my 1st round with Dr. Scott. My second round, I had 2 remaining, and as it was likely our last shot at it, we decided to transfer both. Dr. Scott was supportive. Only one survived, and I now have 2 beautiful sons.We have not discussed yet The clinic would only transfer one embryo due to the completion of PGD testing RMA in general prefers frozen, single embryo transfers and cites this as best practice. Everyone prefers single. We had only wanted a single embryo transfer due to a twin miscarriage in 2011 ( resulting in a singleton). Getting pregnant was not as big of an issue for me as it was staying pregnant. He felt that 1 embryo was all he would ever transfer to put me at less of a risk during pregnancy. Not there quite yet.He did not push single versus multiple (we did not have any make it through genetic testing).  I think he was open to either options but we did not quite get that far.Prefers setDoing eSET. I had requested to go straight to IVF because of an unfortunate circumstance from a previous IUI. She listened to my reasons and was completely supportive. We will be doing eSet, based on past twin loss.Dr. Doherty refuses to allow me to transfer two embryos on my first IVF attempt. Even though I very much want to, he explained the risks of transferring two and the evidence surrounding eSET. I know that his decision is with my safety in mind.N/aHe encouraged me to only transfer one embryo. We talked about it in detailed and agreed it was the best decision for my first transfer.I was 27 at the time and a great candidate for IVF, she was open to transferring 2 eybros ( which is what we wanted) but did warn us that it could result in a high risk pregnancy of multiples   At the time, it was recommended that 3 embryos be transfer. I believe new testing techniques have improved chances of success of just one embryo transfer. N/aTotally agree with esetDr. Fischer's standard is single embryo transfer unless certain circumstances are better suited to multiple.NoneDr. Franasiak explained to us what the pros and cons were of single vs. multiple embryo transfers, and recommended doing a single. We were comfortable with this, and are very happy with the outcome. The doctors at this office only do single embryo transfers to reduce the likelihood of a high risk multiples pregnancy. I would have liked the option to transfer multiples but I trusted that the doctors had my best interest at heart with their policy. It was not a deal breaker for us. RMA will only transfer a single embryo.Chu doesn't like transfering multiple embryos, at least for my age group. She said there is more risk.I haven’t gotten to transfer yet bur I know she favors one embryo due to possible complications with multiple Initially, I wanted to transfer 2 embryos at a time. Dr. Chu talked us out of this because of all the potential complications. I’m very young and healthy so it’s not worth the risk. I was told they only transfer one embryo at a time because its safer and less risks.They strongly encourage genetic testing and single embryo transfer.  Of our three embryos all fertilized and 2 made it to day six blastocyst and then were sent to testing; both were found to be abnormal.  So we never moved onto transfer. RMA does single embryo transfer for younger patients who have not undergone a cycle beforeMy doctor prefers single embryo transfers due to evidence indicating it is equally successful and less harmful to the baby and the mother.He recommended single embryo transfer - which I agree with 100%. We were only ever interested in a single embryo transfer, so this worked well with Dr. Hong's and RMA's preferences. Recommened eSET as we had 7 genetically normal embryos though several were lower graded.  Said grades didn't matter due to testing normalDr. Bergh encouraged one embryo though he allowed me two in my first transfer.  He said he would pick the best embryo from those available to make it most likely to succeed.Very thankful that he advised only a single embryo transfer given the higher risk for complications for multiple embryo transfers.Since this was my first embryo transfer, she strongly advised against a multiple embryos. The risk to mom and babies if both took wasn't one she wanted to put me in. I agreed. IF the first failed (and it didn't) my husband and I might have considered pushing for two the second round. She promotes eSET.  I don't have strong feelings on that either way. I only wanted eSET so it was never even a discussion we ever hadWe inquired about transferring multiple embryos and he was not in favor.  He informed us of the increased chance of the eggs splitting in such a scenario.RMA will only do 1 embryo transfer I believe (with the exception of rare cases) on the first transfer. My lining wasnt thick enough to transfer two. I am hoping the next one the lining will get thicker and we can transfer two. Dr. Shastri is okay with this.They always recommend single embryo transfer unless the women is older. They always stress the how high risk multiple pregnancies can be and try to avoid that.Dr. Hock feels very strongly for eSET to reduce the risk with multiples.she did, and I agreed with her. His approach was single transfer which we agreed upon and was so happy he encouraged thatMy doctor selected the highest grade embryo each time. Makes sense.Dr. Kaser insisted it was best to transfer a single embryo even though I was unsure and thought maybe it would give me better chances to transfer 2.  He said that multiples create more risk and woman are really meant to have 1 at a time.  I am glad he insisted and I trusted him so much that I agreed.  If I had more than 2 embryos I would have pushed for 2 to transfer.  I was good with transferring one since I only had 2.  Dr. Treiser and I discussed MY research on transfering embryos and what I thought was best (freeze all, multiple cycles, then transfer one at a time) and she agreed with my sense of where to go.No comments. I believe he chose the right path for us. My doctor suggested single embryo transfer, and from what I had read I strongly agreed with this approach. We weighed the risks of multiple pregnancies with the costs of performing procedures (ICSI, embryo freezing, genetic testing) that would help us ensure our single embryo was genetically normal. Ultimately we decided the costs were worth the benefits of an increased likelihood of a normal embryo and healthy pregnancy. He was very supportive of only one embryo transfer at a time. Especially due to my age, that worked best for us and got us our miracle baby. He only wanted to transfer PGD tested embryos
RMA strongly prefers eSET, frozen. Especially if you PGS test. I wasn’t given an option to transfer multiples, especially given my age and the fact that I have no miscarriage history. I’m happy with that decision as I am not sure I could handle twins. She prefers eSET and I agree with her approach.  We don't know if we'll have any normal embryos. But if we do, we will definitely only be transferring one at a time.Definitely eSET. Dr. Forman explained that with PGS tested embryos the success rate is very high and therefore not worth the risk of carrying multiples. Dr. Forman encouraged us to do a single embryo transfer during both of our transfers. He provided us with information on the pros and cons of both, and we agreed that single embryo transfer was right for us and our future family. It should be noted that we did CCS testing on our embryos so we had an extra level of confidence making this decision.I was nervous only transferring one embryo because many of my acquaintances and friends had had at least two transferred.  Dr. Forman was pretty adament in recommending I transfer only one because of my age and the risks of multiple pregnancies.  He said the testing has come such a long was that it allows him to choose only healthy embryos to transfer and the rate of success was high with a normal, healthy embryo as ours.  So I trusted him and went with one embryo.  I am pregnant and he was right and I was able to avoid twin pregnancy with all its risks. RMANJ believes strongly in single embryo transfer. There have been studies that show that the success rate is higher when only one embryo is transferred. Their theory is that the embryos compete for resources, so it's better to transfer one embryo at a time.We had 3 embryos which made it to blast, and our first transfer was an eSET and was unsuccessful.   Our second transfer was our choice, and we chose to do a multiple embryo transfer which resulted in a singleton birth. Dr. Drews opinion was that if I wanted 2 babies to put in 2 embryos.  It was the recommendation of Maternal Fetal Medicine dr. to start to put 2 in to net 1.  Dr. Shastri recommended a single embryo transfer to avoid an ""at risk"" pregnancy. She felt there were better chances for success with transfering one embryo.Well we only had 1 to transfer but I like the rationale as the risks for me would have been much higher with a multiple birth (small body frame)They recommended eSET, and did not feel multiple transfer would be as safe.Not much to say..I trust their approach.Dr. Forman always outlined our options.  After several failures, he suggested transferring 2 embryos.  I was uncomfortable and so we proceeded with 1.  The final cycle, my husband and I decided to go for 2 embryos and 1 stuck!Dr. Forman strongly recommended a single embryo transfer stating that there were less chances of complications. I felt very comfortable with that and I really appreciated his honesty.My doctor prefers single embryo transfer but would discuss multiple if I am lucky enough to have multiple embryos to transfer.  At this point, I will be happy with 1.My husband and I agree with Dr. Forman's philosophy of aiming for one healthy baby at a time. A singleton birth typically has less complications and less time (if any) in the NICU. We were fully on board with this.Dr Ryback strongly believes in eSET.  His motto is ""One healthy mother; One healthy baby.""  He explained that multiple embryo transfer does not guarantee multiple live births.  Additionally, multiple embryo's can cause more complications and risks later on.  Even twins pose more risks to each other and to the mother.  He felt that the healthiest option was a single embryo transferred and I completely agreed with him.I was all for transferring two embryos but Dr Morris was really against it.  Ultimately, she told me the decision was mine, but she really did not recommend transferring ore than one.My goal was to have 1 embryo transferred.  Dr. Forman did have a preference on a single embryo transfer and very clearly discussed the pros and cons of each to us.  He said in the future we could revisit it with future embryos, but for our first, our highest success rate for a  healthy pregnancy would be a single embryo transfer.After the loss of my twins at close to 22 weeks, I did not want to risk multiples.  So it was pretty much eSET or nothing, after that.  Dr. Kim agreed.Rmanj really try to keep your transfer to a minimum of 1 because it is safer on the mother and the babies. However the study I was a part of I had to transfer 2 embryos. We transferred 2 each time. My first transfer did not implant, and I'm not sure why. With the second transfer, it was a frozen cycle and I also added in Accupuncture. Initially, I was pregnant with twins, but we lost one at 8 weeks. I would have been very happy with twins, but I do have a healthy almost 20 month old.My doctor advised that we could try one embryo but given our history she was more confident with two. She made sure we were okay with the possibility of twins. She said two was her Max because a uterus is a home not a condominium.He was definitely for SET with testing. He emphasized safety and health for the children and mother I did not get this far when I was under the care of Dr. Morris.I wanted multiple, I was insistant on it, so she listened.N/aI had some complications with my first pregnancy so he would only implant one as it was safest for me and babyHe likes to only transfer one if possible. If the eggs are good quality and there is no reason for the uterus to not take the implantation then he will only want to transfer one. Single embryo transfer since we had PGS normal embryos Dr. Drews is a proponent for eSET. dr scott firmly believes in a SET. he states the goal is to bring a healthy child home from the hospital. not 2 or 3 or 6. however, he can be persuaded under certain conditions to alter his approach.They left it up to us, but encouraged transferring twi because of the grade of the embryos and that I have stage 4 endo. yes we had long conversation about it we decided at 1 but the Dr. gave me the freedom to decide My doctor told me during my initial consultation that single transfer is safer for the health of the baby. When it was time for transfer he gave me a choice of 1 or 2 to transfer. Both transfer I chose 1. Single embryo transfer are safer and recent studies have shown higher success rate. N/aDoherty was very confident and explained why it is better to transfer one embryoI was fully educated to the risks of multiples but was allowed to transfer 2 embryos at my request. She was a strong proponent of a single transfer with a pgs tested embryo which I felt comfortable with.She prefers to do single transfer. I have read enough about the complications with multiple transfers and didn't question it.Dr. Fischer had my health as a priority, she was not concerned about numbers. She decided to transfer one embryo to avoid preterm labor and other complications and I think that was the best call.Dr. M encouraged a single embryo transfer for my case and I 100% agreed with his plan. She is very open to discussing our needs with our age and what our wants are compared to what is realistic for us. ",9.10000000000001,9.10000000000001,"Antagonist protocol with a Lupron trigger as I was at risk for OHSSFemara days 3-7, IUI after a positive OPK and ultrasound to confirm mature folliclesWe did one IUI, and then we went straight to IVF. Positive thing about the clinic is that they do back-to-back iui's which increases the chances...
I was at the beginning of my journey so she told me the treatment was conservative and we would see how i responded. I was on 40 units of lupron daily with 450 gonal F. I was a poor responder and only retrieved one egg. We did indeed switch donors, and did an antagonist protocol (instead of MDLF); the rationale was that I’m not a poor responder, but we had a mysteriously awful blastocyst rate — she thought the Lupron and/or long stim time could be compromising egg quality. Then he put me on injectable hormones for the egg retrieval. Dr. Hock was willing to consider IVF without doing endless cycles of IVF. She recommended implantation of 1 embryo only to reduce the risk with multiples. I ended up having 9 unsuccessful IUIs with and without medication. Luckily both were PGS normal but Dr. Treiser encouraged us to let her try another cycle to see if we could get better results and bank more, higher quality embryos since we do want more than one child. Dr. Forman felt like I was a good candidate for this option that isn't always the first line of treatment. We were discussing the use of progesterone suppositories, but in the end, Dr Ryback wanted me to use the injections since we had not determined my ovulation cycle or if I was ovulating at all. We discovered in our in take testing that our primary issue was male factor (Varicocele) that resulted in us going directly to IVF. In all but one cycle, the menopur worked to grow follicle(s).We did a frozen embryo cycle from a donor cycle, so I was on whatever protocol that would be. I received injections of Follistim, Menopur, Lupron and I'm not sure what the other drugs were without going back to my records. He also recommended testing of the embryos since before I began with him I had 3 losses in a row. So far my retrieval resulted in 18 eggs of which only 11 were fertilized. 8 eggs retrieved 4 to blastocyst and 1 genetically normal and frozen for reciprocal ivfFor retrieval, gonal f, cetrotide, low dose hcg
For transfer progesterone suppositories I used a few different injections to stimulate my ovaries as much as possible. I did not get this far, but she told me she does eSET.No as much as a I wanted multiples transferred at once he reassured me it was not safe due to my age and my body structure. We are not sure as to what he will do for the next transfer. Chu doesn't like transfering multiple embryos, at least for my age group. Dr. Treiser and I discussed MY research on transfering embryos and what I thought was best (freeze all, multiple cycles, then transfer one at a time) and she agreed with my sense of where to go. They left it up to us, but encouraged transferring twi because of the grade of the embryos and that I have stage 4 endo."
61,RMA of New Jersey,cost,"My insurance covered most of my treatments, I was responsible for copays and 20% of insurance. $3000 for IUI~$12,000 (one cycle of IVF with ICSI and one FET)My insurance had a lifetime cap for procedures and prescriptions.  I maxed out my prescriptions and the genetic testing before and of the embryos were not covered. I would estimate we spent $6k out of pocket for 1 IUI and 1 IVF procedure. We paid for pretty much everything out of pocket but there were no surprises. The costs were what they said they would be at the outset. Not cheap--that's for sure but worth it for the level of care they provide. So far around 25k
Everything is out of pocket for me I didn't pay much for my treatment. Insurance covered most of it. $25024k due to double pgdI paid out of pocket so it cost me 3,000 for  Monitoring cycle and about $800 for injectable medication
My insurance pretty good we pay our copays and as far as pricing we were told around $3600 IUI and &gt;$20k for IVF. Finance did call and go over everything with us We received a complete itemized sheets from PGS testing, injectables and medications, processes and co-pays.  They went through our insurance info with us and weeded through everything we'd have to pay out of pocket.  I am lucky with my husband's insurance that we were basically covered so I don't remember the detailed $s.The majority of our costs were covered by insurance except for the genetic counseling and genetic testing. We visited the dietian (covered), a genetic counselor ($100ish?), did laser accupuncture before/after a transfer ($200), and did the genetic testing ($2000ish?)$30,000I was very lucky in that majority of my infertility treatments were covered by my insurance. I opted to pay for genetic testing of the embryos out of pocket.For IVF including 1 egg retrieval and 2 transfers plus all the meds, cost was about $25000Procedures were covered except for 20% deductible and meds we opted for out of pocket.  About $8K for all that so far . I believe it was around $10,000. We ended up not freezing any embryos so the cost was less. RMA has you pay upfront, and then you receive money back if you don't end up using services--it's definitely a plus to receive money back.Our financial coordinator is Suzanne. She is so helpful!! She helped us work out a payment plan when I lost my insurance coverage and worked with us and out team to make sure we would be able to finished the round of treatment we were in middle of!! We love you, Suzanne!!!My insurance company doesn't cover IUI. This office does 2 IUI'S per cycle and each one costs 325 dollars. You have option to only go 1 but we did 2. Also hcg injection is around 200.  IUI was fully covered by insurance, and our IVF was covered by a clinical study. We only paid for medications, which was incredibly reasonable. We have a lifetime max on our insurance. After one cycle, it is exhausted. 20,000~$9,000 for stim and egg retrieval, ~$1,000 for medications, ~$5,000 for genetic testing package (multi-cycle).  Because I am not in New Jersey, monitoring was done by a separate clinic with separate chargesMostly covered by insurance.
IUI - $2400
IVF - $4500My insurance covered all tests, medications, and care. My out of pocket expense was for the donor sperm and IUI procedure. IVF is pricey.  Hard to say whether it's too expensive or not.  This is important.35,000 for one cycle
17,000 for another, but shared cycleI only went for a consultation, and paid the entire thing out of pocket. 
That's $450 for the consultation and over $100 for bloodwork.My IVF treatments were not covered by my insurance.  Our plan covers diagnosis only.My husband and I have been very lucky to have fertility benefits for our cycles that covered a large portion of our costs.  I didn't research the costs before I went but I have great insurance so my out of pocket costs were minimal.  Almost 24 000 not included medication cost15 000 egg retrieval and 4000 each transferMy costs were mostly covered by insurance.Nothing was covered for fertility from my insurance and so far we have spent around $2500 for one IUI and $20000 for IVF stimulation and egg retrieval. Our insurance does not cover infertility. Our consultation was approximately $200 and our initial testing (blood/saline sonogram) was approximately $1,000. I was lucky to have insurance cover all my IUIs, monitoring, HSG test, and endometrial biopsy. I had $50 copays for each visit. Mental counseling there was $175 fee paid directly to the Psychologist. This counseling session was required when using anonymous donor sperm. I believe it’s a higher cost when dealing with a known sperm donor. I had to pay $350 for genetic screening which RMA required I complete prior to starting the cycle. And then for each new donor sperm, I was required to do genetic counseling that fee was $75 each counseling session. And had to pay for donor sperm out of pocket. For my 6 IUIs, I calculated that we’ve spent a little over $10,000. My insurance covers IVF, but there’s a fertility mandate in NJ. This mandate requires me to complete a total of 12 failed IUIs before being required to cover IVF. Hopefully the law will be changed soon. My wife and I decided to do IVF at a different fertility clinic. They have a more affordable price for IVF. Just waiting for this Coronavirus shut down to end to start my cycle.10k. My insurance covered up to 20k lifetime fertility coverage. But I paid co-insurance and the meds out of pocket so I could preserve some of the 20k max. So far, everything has been covered. IUI and IVF are not though and it will be about $4,000 for IUI and $28,000 for IVFFull price of ivf My husband and I have very good insurance. Although our specialist copay is $5, when reviewing the EOBs/claims, RMA had comparable charges to the previous clinic we went to.unknownWith just Dr Kaser about 15,000For our iui cycles, insursance covered most of the cost. We just had to pay co-pays for each visit and medication costs. Our upcoming ivf cycle is going to cost us around $7300.Unfortunately they do not offer any discount or deal for people like myself who have  no infertility coverage. They connect you with a pharmacy that offers a discount but the price of meds is still great. I am just starting IVF and expect to pay around 30, 000 which is more than my yearly salary as a teachers assistant!I had very good health insurance and my entire IVF cycle was 100% covered, the only thing I paid for were my co-pays for medications which in total I paid approximately $200.00. I also chose to do genetic embryo testing which was not covered by insurance and I paid $5,000.00 out of pocket for that. There was no fee for the consultation. I paid several hundred dollars for the HSG procedure to evaluate for tubal blockage (which indeed there was). The bloodwork was covered by insurance so I only paid the co-pay for that part.It was affordable our insurance covered mostly everything needed. My insurance covered the majority of treatment.  I had to pay for PGS testing out of pocket.  It was mostly co-pays with some additional costs for the HSG.  Around $2,000 total.I have insurance coverage for unlimited IUIs and diagnostics and just had to pay co-pays for my visits. We received financial counseling from the first consultation. The ballpark cost that we were originally expecting for thawing/refreezing/CCS testing of embryos (none of which would be covered by insurance) would be approx. $6550. In addition, we would be paying for the courier to move our embryos from Boston to NJ = approximately $800.

The FET cycle itself was expected to cost $4,475 + upwards of $1600 for medication. My insurance would offset some of this cost. 
My husband dealt with the financial aspect of the care. The billing department was easy to deal with from what I recall. Insurance covered some, but I did hit my deductibles.  I also suspect I will hit my next year deductible as well.It cost us a little over $12,000 after insurance. $6,000 was for genetic testing, freezing the embryos, and fees associated with retrieval and fertilization. $1,000 was for Lupron and Low Dose HCG because they needed to be compounded and came from a different pharmacy.All covered by insurance. So far no treatments have not been covered. my insurance at the time only paid for diagnostic tests and not the actual ivf or iui but it did cover the meds like cholmid.  although the first initial visit was about $300 that I didn't have the money to pay for and my fiancée had to pay for it until I could reimburse him (we were not married yet) and now that I have a better job with better insurance it covers most of the office visits and meds but because of the age limit on the mandate it will not pay for the IVF.egg retrieval cycle with ICSI was 13k + drug costs (2.5k) including genetic testing with insurance covering 50%. I had insurance coverage, so not sure of all the costs but I payed approx $4000 on CCD of up to 10 embryos over multiple retrievals and approx $4000 on testing and procedures before my insurance covered at 100%
I had a health care cost and billing explanation consultation with a team member before we bagan any treatments to explain my personal health benefits, what my personal responsibilities would include, what my deductible would be, and what treatments my insurance covers before we ever began diagnostics and treatments.  Everything has been exactly as described at that meeting so I knew going into this treatment what to expect and was financially prepared for the costs associated with my treatment plan.My husband and I paid for all costs out of pocket, this has been a very expensive process so far. We had some testing done in NYC prior to visiting RMA, but the RMA doctors asked that we re-do our testing in their offices, which has made this process very expensive for us. I believe we have spent somewhere around $5k-$7k out of pocket already, and might be looking at up to $32k in additional costs if we proceed with IVF. Our insurance covered a lot of the cost, so we were very fortunate.  Additionally, we opted to pay out of pocket for genetic testing, which was our personal decision. About 15,000 for egg retrieval, and a FET is approximately 4,500I had to pay copays for office visits. I had to pay for the meds for the iui out of pocket (clomid and ovidrel).  My finance contact was able to submit the ultrasounds and blood work separately to my insurance carrier and they paid for that. I will have to pay for the iui procedures out of pocket by all in all, the process has been less costly than I anticipated so far. Thankfully my insurance covers most of my treatment. 
I did have to pay for my blood work that was sent to the foundation and for my medication. Since insurance did not cover those it was over 10,000I had to go thru egg donor and embryo transfer - the total cost was about 25K or more. Please see my previous commens about the billing department for more detail. The billing department was thorough in going through a screen process where they evaluated what your health insurance covered. However they have an outrageous admin fee for donor embryo.$$$$$ we were completely out of pocketco-pays, testing fees, embryo freezing feesWe were extremely lucky to have mostly everything covered by insurance. We only paid out of pocket for ultrasound co-pays, cryopreservation, PGD/CCS testing, and acupuncture before and after transfer. My initial consult with testing will be $450.  I was given a complete breakdown including an estimate for retrieval $11,275, plus meds $5k+, anesthesia $600-1200, biopsy $1,700, PGS up to ten $2500, FET cycle approximately $5k.My insurance covered meds and IUI treatments and bloodwork, so I paid a $40 copay for each visit where I had an ultrasound.  I did have some out-of-pocket costs associated with my hysteroscopy, of course, but that was my insurance deductible.  I know they have a 6-cycle money-back-guarantee IVF program, but my husband and I haven't decided if we want to go that route. My insurance covered the retrieval and transfer. Had to pay a bunch for meds that were not completely covered and for the freezing and genetic testing of the embryos.Our insurance has covered most costs. For monitoring, I have a co-pay only for ultrasounds, not bloodwork. We will have some out-of-pocket costs for IVF beyond what insurance will cover.I had excellent insurance coverage, which covered most of treatment cost. I was responsible for co-pays, deductible, co-insurances.One month and 2 IUI procedures out of pocket costs were $650, with ultrasounds, bloodwork, tests, etc being covered by insurance. The finance team made sure to explain all costs and what I should expect. They were very helpful and well-informed on my insurance provider Too many to remember but I think each IVF retrieval cycle cost about $6000 and medication cost another $4000. The frozen transfer cost about  $3000 and the medications about $1500 I have wonderful insurance, but because we used an egg-donor, there was a substantial fee to her.  We also had to pay out-of-pocket for some other services that we chose (i.e. chromosomal testing of embryos). My insurance covered almost everything except for the occasional $10 copay and the cost for embryo cryopreservation and storage (explicitly excluded as part of the NJ state mandate).EVERYTHING WAS COVERED UNDER INSURANCE
AND I DIDNT INQUIRE, BUT THEY WERE OFFERING NICE IVF PACKAGES..I don't remember exactly, but I had a $30 copay for each time I went in for morning monitoring (which ended up being anywhere from 1-6 times each week). My insurance paid for a lot of the IVF cycle but we paid about $3,000 for PGD and misc expenses.Covered by insurance. Co-pay was our only out of pocket outside of medication.We had insurance coverage and only had to pay co-pays and for CCS.who knows?  we were always paying even after cancelled cycles.  over 18 months later, they sent a mystery bill for 4k.  no one there knows why but we called for months to resolve.The IVF procedure cost approximately $10,000 plus $2,500 for ICSII don't remember but it was worth every penny.Most of it was covered by insurance, but if I didn't have insurance it would have been around $20,000.My IUIs were covered so I only had co-pays of $25I do have insurance coverage for IVF and they’ve been great about communicating the costs. I do feel like the more expensive route is always recommended (ie ICSI, genetic screening) but that may just be normal course of action. Not sure where it's all going to land. Between $15,000 -- $20,000 since insurance isn't covering it. I am not covered at all for fertility. And the ivf costs were to much for my husband and I. Dr. Werner fought to get me added to a clinical trial to help pay for a ivf round, minus the cost of anesthesia, meds and sperm freezing.I had excellent insurance throughout my treatment. My IVF cost use about 2,000. dollars. My insurance covered most except genetic testing for my husband.A lot of money!!!!! Total paid to RMA was approximately 16000 with insurance coverage for certain medical procedures Not sure yet... there are a couple variables in play. Most likely between $20,000 - $40,000.Insurance covered my costs. We have very good insurance. Once I hit my deductible it was 80/20. For 2 cycles of IUI, monitoring, HSG, saline sonogram, cd3 bloodwork, etc  maybe $3500My iui were covered by insurance once I met my 1800 deductible.  Had some coverage for the meds. 
No ivf coverage.  Discussed and it was roughly around 30k that we don't have.Under 10k for monitoring and EREach retrieval cycle would be about $13 k.We have been out of pocket 100% for each cycle. 2008, 2011... 2016 in addition to cost of termination and then ccs testing, and another cycle in 2017. 
2008- aprox 30k with meds Retrival fresh transfer
2011- Fet transfer aprox 15k
2016-$3875
Abortion $600
CCS testing $4500
2017- Fet aprox 2k IVF total out of pocket: around $7000 (rest covered by insurance)Very high but fortunately had insurance..but out of pocket was still very high...It was all billed through my insurance so I just paid my portion through coinsurance for my treatments. We did have to pay out of pocket for the genetic testing of our embryos which was approximately $5000I don't recall. Fortunately, I had great health insurance.  I was responsible for the fee for the donor, medications and copays.  Copays for all doctor related visits including ultrasound. Medications. Purchasing spermI don’t recall. Overall I’d say it cost me about 12,000 $50 copays each visit and OOP expenses for medications. $18K for the round of IVFWe used Attain for outside prepay financing Expensive because our insurance had a lifetime max of 5k. The retrieval our of pocket was 16k and meds for retrieval 4.5kThere was an out of network fertility deductible but it cost around 8,000Our insurance will cover some of our donor egg process but we will still have to manage a good deal of out of pocket expenses.IVF was 30,000 IUI was 4,000IUI mostly covered by insuranceThus far a few thousand Our surrogate's health insurance covered many of the costs. But it's been too long to remember the exact amounts required. $6000 a cycle for IUISo far, all costs have been covered by insurance. Mostly covered by insurance. i don't want to share costsCCS testing. $4500

Sperm freeze $1000It was 100% covered by insurance I'm paying approximately $14000 for the embryo adoption A lot was cover under our insurance A lot!  Approx $25k in total. Expensive but worth it .  Insurance was great but copays suckInsurance covered a lot thankfully but we have spent thousands out of pocket $20,000 for one round of IVF and $4000 for one round of IUI. Retrieval probably $15,000; transfer $4000Luckily my insurance covered my fet 100%Our total IVF cycle cost was about $26K plus meds and luckily I had good insurance coverage and paid $300 for meds and $3200 for the entire cycle.I have great insurance but we had to pay for freezing and genetic testing.  Fees were aligned with other office prices. I had to pay out of pocket for a lot in order to reach my deductible, but the team was willing to work with me to pay what I could each monthMost of my care was covered through my insurance by 80%. Insurance covered everything except medication. It was about $1000 per cycle for the medications We are very fortunate in that my health insurance covered the cost of diagnosis, IVF, and related care. I only paid the co-pay and a percentage of the medication costs. We have great insurance and most what what we had done was covered. The PSG testing was not covered but was mandatory from the clinic and cost us about 2,000 dollars. We had to pay about 275 for genetic counseling and then with meds and co-pays we paid approx. an additional 1,000-2,000 for IVF. I can covered by insurance. My OPCs are related to acupuncture, medication copays, embryo genetic testing, cryopreservationVery expensive. Our cycles were covered by our Insurance however we had to pay a very large sum for our genetic testing. 
The day before we started our second cycle at about 2:30 in the afternoon we received a call from Jenna in finance telling me that we had no IVF coverage which was not true. We spoke with our insurance provider who also assured us our insurance was in place. My husband and I both had to leave our work early to spend over three hours on the phone with Jenna and our insurance yo convince them that we have coverage. The insurance agent even put us on a three way call to tell her we have been approved for the cycle. The insurance agent was even irritated by their issues. The mistake in the end was on their part. Surprise surprise. They tell you don’t be stressed and then tell you the day before a cycle you have no insurance. Absolutely incompetent. I paid cash and it's not cheap.I am not entirely sure because I have insurance. First cycle was covered by insurance aside from deductible. Our insurance changed and they did not cover our second egg retrieval cycle. It was around $20,000 out of pocket for everything. Transfer will be around $5,000. We have insurance coverage and have already met our OOP maximum, but I believe our insurance cost is about 10kOur insurance covered $15,000 but on top of that we paid $15,300 out of pocket including medicines (over $8,000 one time and the rest was split up) up front before we could continue. $15,300 for retrieval ICSI and genetic testing, for their agreement with Aetna which does not cover IVF. 
Transfer would have been $4,500 more.
My medications were covered, minimal copay.  Insurance covered most of my treatment. Embro cryopreservation and genetic testing were not covered ($5k). And probably another $1-2k for copays, medication, etc.My fertility preservation was largely covered by a grant for cancer patients. PGS testing, Embyro storage fees. All the rest was charged and covered by insurance
Egg donor/retrieval cost approximately $25,000. Embryo transfer was approximately $5000. All appointments with ultrasounds were $500 and doctor's consult was $250 each time.For embryo freezing, it was about $18,000 including ICSI and CCS. Then I paid another $4,000 for meds, but that turned out to be covered by insurance.Treatment was covered by insurance which was billed about 17K per stimulation cycle (including PGT and ICSI) and 5K for FET transfer. 
 Medications were about 6K per stimulation cycle. 
Shotty insurance coverage for IUIs left us with owing around 3k. Neither one of us have IVF coverage, so we had to take out a loan via lending club for the cycle, and paid for meds out of pocket. I was very fortunate that my costs were almost entirely covered by insurance. Insurance paid for some of our care and we had a family friend help with the remaining amountOver $5,000 out of pocketAt the beginning of my first IVF cycle, I signed up a special program through ARK, where I paid roughly $21,000 for 2 fresh and 2 frozen cycles until I conceived.  It was so relieving to know that if one didn't work, I wouldn't have to shell out tons more to try again.  In the end, we used one fresh and one frozen cycle for my son.  I think we spent another $4500 for PGD, which was fortuitous because of my 15 embryos, 5 were abnormal and I am so relieved I didn't have to live through a miscarriage from transferring an abnormal embryo.I do not recall; it was a lot.approximately $2,500 out of pocket and well worth every penny!!!!IVF with meds was about 18k+. IUI with injectible meds was 4k+Everything was paid for out of pocket. With meds, IVF, PGS, we spent about $25,000 for one round. They do not offer IVF packages for multiple rounds for those paying out of pocket, or at least none were offered to us at the time.35KThe 3 rounds of iui and 4 rounds of Ivf were covered under my insurance.  The donor egg cycle was $48,000.  It was about $2400 for genetic testing on the embryos which I did twice.14,000 for Egg retrieval, Icsi, Genetic testing for couple and genetic testing of embryo, embryo and egg freezing. (Not including medication)We have a High Deductible plan as well as a $15,000 life time max for fertility.  We also had to have a genetic probe created which was not covered by insurance.  Total out of pocket $15,000We had to pay for each vial of sperm though that is not associated with the clinic at all.  To date we have spent nearly $10,000 to that end.  Because my wife and I have good insurance, RMA collected copays from us until our deductible was reached and then they collected nothing from us when monitoring.  Because we ran out of money for fertility treatments under my wife’s insurance we were responsible for paying approximately $9000 for the remaining cost of our first retrieval which included ICSI and the testing of embryos.  We decided to pay the cash rate for meds so to not take even more money out of that bucket; this cost us approximately $3500.  We are still waiting to see how much my transfers will cost us as it’s possible her insurance will cover some of those expenses.  If not each transfer will cost us about $4500.Medications were almost fully covered for all cycles during co-IVF, IUIs, retrieval and upcoming transfer.  I paid my copays for medications with the exception of Low dose HCG that was not covered and Endometrium.  In total, I have paid around $1000.00 in copays.  For our first retrieval and first two FET, we paid out of pocket as we were not covered under the NJ state mandate.  We paid approximately $22,000.  This year, the IUIs were covered under my insurance and we were only responsible for copays and coinsurance.  Since we have now reached our lifetime fertility max, we paid $4.475 for the upcoming transfer cycle and about $3,800 for the retrieval.  We are waiting for the claims to be processed by the insurance company to determine if we are still responsible for more.  In addition to the costs of treatment, we have paid storage fees as well as donor sperm (totaling over $6,000).I was covered by my insurance for my first 3 transfers. I will be doing another one soon and I was informed the cost would be $6k.My insurance covers most everything. Have a small copay for some meds. A couple compounded meds I had to pay out of pocket for but could get reimbursement. When I had IUIs only my ultrasound days required a co pay, in IVF cycle I only paid a co pay one time. Nurses do complementary education for PIO shots the first time. CCS testing was out of pocket and included 10
Embryos. More than ten was $125 each to test and then none of the cryo was covered. $1000 to freeze embryos, $300 every time a sprem sample was frozen.We did owe co-pays during certain visits, but I was very lucky that insurance covered most of our treatment and medicine.35k for retrievals 
40k for donor eggs+ transfers Payment of deductibles or any outstanding balances must be paid in full before a cycle is started. The billing team is willing to work with a patient to create a payment plan but then a cycle cannot be started until it is completed. They are readily available to speak to and check your benefits.I had insurance coverage so had a $2500 annual out of pocket and then minimal costs. meds were a few hundred $ only for each cycle, also thanks to my insurance coverage. 60000-75000For an IVF cycle, insurance was charged $9500. I paid approximately $3000 out-of-pocket which covered the cryopreservation and the coinsurance portion.A full cycle from retrieval to transfer is approx 20k and meds 4KMy insurance covered the IUIs and regular appointments, monitoring, and lab work.  I had a $40 copay.  When I switched to IVF my insurance did not cover it and I paid a lump sum for all associated visits and the procedure itself.  It was around $20,000 I think.  Then I paid an additional lump sum for the FET cycle of around $4,000 which again included monitoring.  I also had to pay for the medications during the IVF cycle.  I am not sure what the total cost was but it was more than $2000.  Retrieval was about $15k including icsi and pgs testing.  Frozen transfer was about $4K. We got some package for our second retrieval so it was about 8k. IVF with ICSI at RMA is normally roughly 20000 a cycle without insurance.   I got a package with ARC (financing that RMA offers) for 3 cycles with ICSI and 6 transfers, for roughly 40000 financed.
They also have an interesting setup for PGS testing where you pay to ""buy in"" to a package of 10 embryos tested for roughly $4000 where those 10 embryos can be all in one cycle or if not used, spills over to subsequent cycles.   They provided me with a program called “helping heros” and since we were a military family they completely paid for my retrieval and transfer and all Monitoring in full. In addition, they coveted the costs of cryopreservation of my embryos for 2 years after treatment. They also stored my husbands sperm for 1 year at no cost to us. The only costs we had were to the pharmacy for our medications, and even then dr Franasiak provided some samples at no cost to help with the expense. Initially my insurance fully covered IUI but not IVF, so for my two IUI cycles I paid about $650 for initial diagnostic blood work, an HSG, and co-pays for two visits and medications. All my monitoring visits and the IUI procedure itself were fully covered. For my IVF cycle I had a $10,000 lifetime maximum. Total costs from RMA for the cycle were: $7,977 for the egg retrieval procedure; $1,963 for ICSI; $700 for anesthesia; $1,000 for embryo freezing for up to one year; $1,700 for embryo biopsy; $2,500 for genetic testing;  and $4,475 for the embryo transfer. So I paid about $10,315 out of pocket for those expenses. I also paid about $5,500 out of pocket for medications for both the egg retrieval and transfer cycles. And I paid about $400 in co-pays for monitoring visits during both cycles.

I ended up receiving a $4,300 reimbursement from RMA and about $5,000 in reimbursements for medications from my insurance company, so total out of pocket costs were ~$7,000.Luckily my insurance covered portions of the IVF costs but there are other components that aren't covered. They would be the genetic testing which was $4,000, the medications which totaled $4000 and the acupuncture which was $200. The out of pocket costs are quite extreme especially since even with insurance coverage, there are many parts which aren't covered. My insurance only covers one procedure every 24 months, so if a cycle fails, then everything will then be out of pocket. There is also the storage fee for sperm and embryos which is $1,200 per year for each. My insurance covered most of it. Also with my insurance medications were discounted. Laser acupuncture they provided was not covered although acupuncture is covered by my insurance.My insurance covered IVF luckily, but PGS was out of pocket. We paid $2500 for up to 10 embryos, and then $125 per additional embryo (total $3250). We also had co-pays for visits and meds. 20k out of pocketHa! Expensive. Luckily we had some insurance coverage. But that quickly runs out and also our insurance didn't cover thinks like genetic testing and embryo freezing. Blocked out how much out of pocket expenses we had - but definitely worth it. I'm fortunate that I had coverage with my health insurance.  I hadn't met my deductibles for the year so the price I paid RMA for 2 retrieval cycles along with egg freezing (after insurance coverage) was $4,200; EXCLUDING medication.Because we paid out of pocket we purchased a ""package"" from a third party finance company that works directly with RMANJ that covered the egg retrieval, two transfers, and morning monitoring. This package cost around $16,000. We also paid for genetic testing which cost around $500 and opted for CCS testing which was $2,500.I was fortunate to have great fertility coverage until BCBS PPO  but even so I met my max before the end of the year for meds and had to pay couple thousand for that (had two IUI, two egg retrievals in one year)We had general copays. We also had to pay embryo cryo and storage fees. I have great insurance, so I had a copay at consult, at start of cycle and the pregnancy monitoring.   I am VERY lucky.  My insurance has covered every single IVF bill except for the genetic testing of my embryo's, which was $5,000 out of pocket (plus my deductible of course).  We decided to do a 2nd screening of my embryo's to take advantage of next generation technology and RMA comped this test - free of charge!  Insurance covered all infertility treatments in full with an unlimited lifetime maximum. Only had to pay office copay $35 and prescription drug copays.
CCS testing for up to 10 embryos over multiple cycles $6,500.I did the careshare program and we spent 32,000, 600 for anesthesia, 1,500 for meds.  Then copays leading up to treatment $60 each time I went.IUI's: around 8K total
IVF with medication: 28KRoughly about 6-7KThe health insurance company covered most costs, with the exception of our deductible, co-insurance and embryo testing/freezing.Somewhere around $15,000My treatments were covered by insurance.  For the IUIs I paid a co-pay for each office visit and for the treatments.  For IVF, I paid a per cycle one-time co-pay and took out a personal loan for costs not covered by insurance.I believe all said and done it was about $20-25K; however, insurance paid for a good portion. We were able to freeze embryos if we decided to have more children. The cost for FET for subsequent pregnancies was very reasonable.We were lucky enough to have insurance cover much of our cycle, including PGS testing.I was lucky enough to have fantastic medical coverage.  We paid out of pocket for freezing embryos, acupuncture and PGD testing.  We roughly paid about $6,000 in out of pocket expenses.Everything was in-network with my insurance plan, so I just had to pay co-pays for a couple non-monitoring/cycle-related appointments. Additional costs that were optional and not covered by insurance were for CCS, cryopreservation, and biopsy of the day-6 embryos for $4,000; an extra sperm sample that had to be frozen for about $300 I think; and we spent $200 twice for laser acupuncture on the days of my 2 transfers. Since we had already done genetic testing and counseling at the previous clinic, we were able to bypass that at RMA, so I'm not sure if there would've been a cost associated with that.We were lucky to have insurance cover majority of the costs. We only had to pay a small co pay for each medication, PGD testing and the costs to freeze and store extra embryos. I don't remember the exact amount we spent, but between 3 IUIs, 1 IVF, and medications, we spent close to $30,000, all out of pocket.  When 2 IUI cycles were not completed fully (we missed one out of 2 days for Christmas and another day bc of a snowstorm), I asked Dr. Molinaro if we could catch a little break on them.  He didn't hesitate to answer, ""of course"" and he told our finance coordinator (who we had to switch) to take off 10% from our IUI bill.  Since we also had an issue with our first finance coordinator, when I told Dr. Molinaro, he immediately took action to switch her for us and a new woman called us the next day.I was very lucky to have IVF covered under my insurance. Out of pocket, I paid for my medicines, and for costs associated with PGD testing and embryo freezing. Insurance covered up to $10,000. I paid out of pocket, approximately $940 for egg retrieval, $4,300 for PGD testing, and $3,875 for FET. Costs are reasonable for the service and atmosphere they provide. Honestly...would have to look at all my 100 pages of receipts for OOO expenses. Overal  i was lucky to be covered by insurance but after trying for so many years I exhauste it and also we did PGD testing which is very expensive. In total I'm  about not at a total of aprox $40,000. A LOT!! Unfortunately, our insurance did not cover much of our care, but we were aware of typically how much we were going to spend at RMA.It was quite expensive, but worth very penny. We had 3 failed IUIs and 2 failed IVFs before this clinic. The prices at the other clinic were much cheaper, BUT with all the failed attempts, we ended up spending a lot more. So RMA was worth every penny because we got pregnant! Around $18k for one frozen cycle not including meds We are completely paying OOP for everything. Dr. Drews helped us with a discount when we did our second FET after the clinical trial we were in was over. About 95-99% of my bills were covered through insurance, (roughly $15,000+ for the injections, monitoring, and egg retreival.)  I don't remember how much the transfer was (maybe $5,000-$10,000 but I honestly don't remember.)

There is a $1200/year embryo storage fee which was also not covered by insurance.

My insurance did not cover the PGD testing.  I paid out of pocket for testing the chromosomes of the embryos, which costed $4500 for up to 12 embryos.  (I had 5 embryos, still the same $4500)I don't remember the actual breakdowns of everything, but the IUi's cost about $3,000 each (not covered by insurance) and the IVF (covered by insurance) still cost me $10,000.I was fortunate in that insurance paid for my treatment.  I paid approximately $1200 for freezing the extra embryos.  I also paid $300 for genetic screening. I would have to look back and see what each costed, but we were fortunate to have good insurance coverage. Overall I would say we've spent about $10,000-$12,000 in a year and a half including 2 egg retrievals, medications, appointments, 1 hysteroscopy, 1 d&c, and three embryo transfersWe were paying for the ivf procedures out-of-pocket but testing and consults were covered. We spent a lot of money there.I blocked it out :-) but it was in the average range for fertility care 15-20K.Maxed out my $30,000 lifetime infertility benefits after one retrieval cycle. Spent over $10,000 out of pocket.About $12k for egg retrieval and FET.I do not remember all the costs but my insurance covered most.  A few hundred dollars in co pays for the appointments and medicine.  We paid a couple hundred for the freezing of my husbands sperm and genetic counseling.  

We also are paying $1000 annually to freeze the embryos.  We met with an RMA financial consultant who thoroughly explained all the fees involved.  We were well informed and have no complaints. We paid out of pocket for retrieval first transfer, meds, pgd, and 2nd transfer.  3rd and fourth transfer were completely covered.  In our out of pocket retrieval, they worked with certain companiessothat US, blood, and diagnostics were all covered.I do not remember the specifics. I believe my health insurance covered some of the costs.The PGD testing we opted for was $7,000 out-of-pocket, but all other costs were covered by my insurance.  IVF fee was around $18,000 with meds costing about $5,000. Freezing embryos yearly is $1,000 and transfer is $2,500 plus meds. Acupuncture was $200. 
Did not have insurance coverage. 
Similar rates to local clinic in another state. Very expensive obviously... But the financial department was very helpful and did what they could to push things through insurance.My insurance covered everything but a co pay for appointments, freezing my embryos, testing me embryos, and some medications.  My insurance covered my retrieval and we paid out of pocket for the transfers and cryopreservation of our frozen embryos (yearly storage fee). My medicine was 90% covered with my insurance so I only had small payments out of pocket for my cycles ($25-$200). I also used my company's FSA account to cover most of the out of pocket expenses. I truly don't remember exact costs. I do know I was one of the lucky ones who's  insurance covered most of our treatment except for genetic counseling and freezing. I am lucky in that a lot was covered by insurance.  We paid $1200 to freeze our embryos and $3500 for ICSI and PGD.  Our initial genetic testing (prior to any cycles) was $300.  Plus co-pays for each visit.With my insurance, my costs were minimal.  The largest cost was PGD/CCS.  Other payments were co-pays and some lab fees and minor medication supplies and supplement costs.$40,000+Monitoring days/bloodwork days, I had no copay. They performed double IUIs for the cost of one. IVF cost was 10,500 ICSI AND genetic testing was included (part of study) My insurance covered most things. I did have some bigger costs with meds, but overall it wasn't bad.  When they merged with RMA, costs drastically went up. My storage fee when from $400 a year to $1,200 a year! Also, costs for every visit went up. RMA charges a co-pay for literally everything. Consult was $300
Everything else totaled about 30k. I had monitoring, retrieval, freezing, PGD, laser acupuncture, frozen transfer, also pregnancy ultrasounds. It cost around 20k.I don't remember, but I was fortunate to have my insurance cover a great deal of it. Oh boy! So, we took out a loan for medical loan that they have at that clinic. So, we never saw the money, it was sent straight to the clinic. All I remembered, if we needed to speak with Dr. Morris, it will cost us each time $300 for 15 minutes of her time. I had insurance but still needed to pay some deductibles with medicine and other issues. $7,000 PGS banking and such.including insurance coverage 8k Costs were definitely much higher than at our other clinic.20 k in total with all pretesting  About $5000 for genetic testing and $1200/year for frozen embroyo Storage of frozen embryos and anything related to genetic testing as well as medication copays1 cycle for a frozen embryo retreival cost around 5200 including genetic testing. Most covered under insurance I was a part of their refund guarantee plan which was about $30k for up to six cycles.My egg freezing cycle was $8150 and my meds were $300 (covered by insurance). The second round will be $5000 because I hit my deductible. I recall it was more expensive then treatment in NYInsurance covers monitoring, testing, etc., but I have no coverage for treatment. The fresh cycle including ICSI was about $11,000 plus almost $5000 for medications. Insurance covered most of this, and Dr. Forman and the finance team was extremely helpful in getting it covered since I had a preexisting condition.Our insurance covered 100%I paid normal copays. Our insurance covered everything except egg freezing and storage. We pay appx $1k/yr for that.i hed a Charity org‎ help me so i dont real konw I was in a study so my costs were not too extreme. $15,000.00Some general things covered by insurance

23,000 for 2 donor egg cycles under program My entire cycle was about $20,000 I thinkJust medication, which was through CVS Caremark - about $350. Fertility treatment is not cheap, but we were confident we were under the best care we could get and that justified all the cost. We had two IUI and two IVF round, that all cost us around $65,000.00 including medication.

63,RMA of Philadelphia,doctor,"Dr. Allison Lange was very knowledgeable and thorough when she created our treatment plan. She was able to walk us through the plan and answer any questions regarding our specific case. When I had blood work or ultrasounds done, if she was not the doctor on call, she still reviewed all of the results and made the final decisions. When we went through our unfortunate ectopic pregnancy, she was there to tell me the next steps. Dr. Lange went out of her way to personally make arrangements for me and made sure that I understood everything fully. She was very compassionate and made me feel like I was important. After, she personally called to check in on how I was doing physically and emotionally. She set up another appointment to review our treatment plan and answer any questions we may have had. Dr. Gutman is very patient, caring and experienced.  While you can tell she is very busy with many patients, the appointments never felt rushed.  If questions aren't asked, she won't got into much detail. However when questions are asked, she will tell you what she is was thinking.  Overall I would say her methods are on the traditional/conservative side. While I appreciate her not pushing any products or treatments that don't have proven success rates, I do wish we would explore more out of the box options. Overall, I feel a sense of trust working with Dr. Gutman and feel like she truly cares about my outcome.  Strengths and weaknesses

Dr. Schlaff was knowledgeable, compassionate, warm, and direct. He made several small adjustments during my cycle that I truly believe made a difference in our outcome, such as delaying our retrieval by two days to allow for more follicles to mature (resulting in a couple more eggs being retrieved than would have otherwise) and also delaying our FET because I had fluid in my uterus. He adjusted medications to reduce the fluid down to almost none by transfer day. I found him to be an excellent communicator and felt from the beginning that no matter the outcome, we would have been satisfied that we gave it one last try under his care. I would wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Schlaff to anyone and can think of no weaknesses whatsoever. Dr. Gutman is brusk and and no-nonsense, but she is also incredibly intelligent and honest, which makes her very trustworthy. The way she casually talks about the procedure puts you at ease and makes you realize that she has done this a hundred times and knows what she is doing. Her treatments are kind of drawn out, however that's because she requires constant consultations and re-evaluations to make sure that you are completely safe and avoid any potential risks during the treatment. She's funny and I never once felt judged or uncomfortable with her. Once visit, I told her I was on my way to a baby shower and she said, ""Well, if you need me to write you a doctor's note, I will absolutely do that."" She understands how hard the journey is but doesn't dwell on it and always pushes forward.  Dr. Castelbaum is a very smart man. He is not an alarmist - he only gives you the information you need, and I think that’s to keep you for over analyzing or overthinking. I do, though, prefer to have more knowledge than I may need, so this has bothered me from time to time. When in his care, you need to have the mindset that he’s a professional and you need to trust him. Sometimes this can be hard for me, but I have seen many people have great success with him, so I do trust him. Dr. Guttman has been a perfect balance of no-nonsense and compassion.  She doesn't sugar coat and gets right to the point (which I greatly appreciate), but when I had my miscarriage she was gentle, compassionate, and sympathetic.  She has always answered and addressed my questions (even the crazier ones),  and I feel very comfortable and confident continuing treatment with her.He put on a great show for my initial consult but after that was a train wreck. I had nothing but un-monitored cycles. I had an adverse reaction to a fertility medication that I was prescribed and was told to go see my ob/gyn..theres nothing that they can do for me. He never wanted to increase my dosage nor did he want to do a monitored cycle out of the four cycles that I did with him. At my last visit he decided to put me on a different medication and suggested that I not do IUI and go straight to IVF but that I would need to find a new job that covers IVF. As I was leaving he loudly said now go make us look good and get pregnant. WHO SAYS THAT?!I saw Dr. Gutmann 4-5 times initially, during the various exploratory & diagnostic phases (consultation, a monitored clomid cycle, HSG, blood and semen tests, etc.) that led to unexplained fertility diagnosis.

While not stereotypically warm and fuzzy, she has a great style that really clicked for us: remembering personal details and preferences/goals, informed by the latest science, with a bit of dry humor thrown in there.Dr Castelbaum is amazing! I thought I would never have children of my own and now I have a daughter and another little one on the way! He gave me the family I was dreamed of! I HIGHLY recommend Dr Castelbaum and RMA!When i first met with dr Lange she thoroughly reviewed my records from previous doctors and cycles and explained how we would approach treatment with her and what to expect. Once I went through an egg retrieval and then frozen transfer which resulted in a chemical, she recommended further testing as far as a miscarriage panel and ERA biopsy. I also recommended some further tests like natural killer cells and she agreed and wrote for it. Once we reviewed all results she took a different approach this time around which i am currently in the process of getting ready for a transfer. We made adjustments like synthroid for my borderline tsh, also started me on letrozole for a month to suppress my system for my endometriosis, along with testing my pituitary by ct scan due to elevated prolactin levels and started me on a medication for hyperprolactinemia, and I will get intralipid infusions for elevated NO cells . And will adjust my progesterone injections from the results of my era. To say the least I think that is very thorough and shows she is trying to everything she can to make this cycle work.Dr. Gutman is very knowledgeable, compassionate and has a great sense of humor.  During our first consultation and workup she was completely upfront and honest with what my test results revealed and the potential difficulties that could lie ahead.  However, she was always very empathetic and made it known that she was confident in her abilities and was going to work very hard to achieve my desired results.  I felt very comfortable in her presence and confident in the treatment decisions that she made throughout my care.  She understood how crazy the back and forth almost daily visits at times for monitoring could be and did her best to take my life/work schedule into consideration.  I don't know that I could have had a better experience.  She truly made this very stressful process go much smoother than I ever anticipated.  I am blessed to have found such an amazing fertility Dr.Dr. Gutman seems to be a no-nonsense doctor. While my partner and I have been having fertility problems she said our outlook is optimistic. I don’t think she would have said this if she didn’t believe it. We went to her for a second opinion and she discussed different ways she would change our current fertility regimen. This was helpful in that we were able to discuss these suggestions with our primary fertility doctor. 

Dr. Gutman also offered us the single best piece of advice we have received in our fertility journey. After 2 years, multiple IUIs, a cycle of IVF we were unsure of how to proceed on this journey. Dr. Gutman stated that whatever we decide we should be able to look back and be comfortable with the decisions we made.  In this painstaking, emotional journey those words ring very true as we proceed in trying to make our family. I felt like Dr Castelbaum has a very high opinion of himself and his clinic. He spent a lot of time talking about how his clinic did well when inspected by the FDA. This seemed like a strange thing to talk about during our consult with some difficult news. I felt like he was pressuring us to use a donor egg without asking how we felt about it. He really dumped a lot of difficult information on us at once without much compassion. He suggested we have a cry and beer at home before coming back and talking with him again. If felt very strange and like we were taking up space in his office is we weren’t totally on board with his plan after 5 minutes of discussion. He was very blunt and said “you’re a complicated case” immediately after we entered the room. He prescribed Clomid and did not offer to monitor or follow up with me. I had a very bad drug reaction and spoke with a nurse who said she spoke with the doctor and told me there was nothing they could do and I should see my general doctor. When I called a week later seeking guidance after I got my period, I spoke with a nurse who said she would talk to the doctor and get bs m to me and they never did. I’m so glad we went elsewhere! Dr. Castelbaum genuinely cares about the patients he works with.  He was warm, friendly, and funny when appropriate.  He treated me and my partner with the utmost respect and dignity.  He worked extensively to help us with the situation we had, and constantly expressed empathy and compassion for our specific case.  I absolutely love being a patient of his and wish all doctors had the knowledge and kindness he freely displays.Dr. Gutman’s balance of bedside manner and intellectual prowess were so good that, as dreaded as the process could be (and it was since I had a miscarriage at first), We still always looked forward to seeing her.I honestly can't think of a single weakness when it comes to Dr. Castelbaum. He is knowledgeable, compassionate, thorough, and kind. No two people are the same and he knows that and it shows in how he interacts with each of his patients. My husband and I brought embryos with us to Dr. Castelbaum from another facility. He was up front in telling us that he wanted his embryologist to review them because every clinic has their own guidelines for freezing and storing embryos and he wouldn't know what we had until they could look at them for themselves.  After the first transfer with him from those embryos it resulted in a successful pregnancy where I gave birth to a healthy baby girl.  Upon returning to the office two years later we did 4 additional transfers. The first 2 were with our remaining embryos we had brought with us from the other facility. From those, we had 1 early miscarriage (blighted ovum) and 1 chemical pregnancy.  We then did another round of injections for egg retrieval.  First transfer from this round was a chemical pregnancy. Second transfer was successful and I'm currently 10 weeks, 3 days pregnant and was discharged to my OB a week ago.  It's so easy to blame doctors for a failed embryo transfer. My failed transfers were devastating to me; but I also remember how shocked and upset Dr. Castelbaum was for us.  We did not do genetic testing although it was recommended to us to reduce the risk of miscarriage. Even though we chose not to, we were never judged for it. I almost gave up after the third failed transfer. Emotionally, I didn't know if I could keep going.  Mentally, I knew I wasn't ready to give up.  I'll never forget what Dr. Castelbaum said to me on my last appointment: ""I know you were ready to jump ship and I understand why. But I'm so glad you didn't. It takes a lot of courage to do what you did. I'm glad I got to be a part of this and am so happy for you.""  These words will stick with me the rest of my life and I still tear up thinking about it.  I could never thank him enough for all he's done for me and my husband. Dr. Freedman did exactly what he set out to do. His role was to help me get pregnant with a healthy baby. We got pregnant with our first transfer (under his care) with a PGS normal Male embryo.  He followed our progress daily and called personally to congratulate us!  He made sure our questions were answered the same day we asked. You can't ask for much more.I saw Dr. Gutmann primarily for our diagnostic work up as we then moved out of state.  The clinic has you complete a through form outlining your medical history and history trying to conceive.  During my initial appointment with her, Dr. Gutmann reviewed my answers with me and asked follow up questions when needed.  My husband had to participate by phone and she answered his questions as well as mine. She explained the benefit of getting a HSG completed.  I ended up getting my HSG done by her a few weeks later.  I was very nervous and found the procedure to be painful   She was kind and compassionate throughout.     Dr. Castelbaum was very positive and kept my spirits up during the low points of fertility treatments. He seemed confident that he would help get me pregnant and he did. There were some roadblocks that we had to get through but he always found the solution. He misdiagnosed me with unexplained infertility at first. During IVF, hydrosalpinx was found on my one fallopian tube. He quickly set up surgery to remove the tube and assured me that my chances of IVF success would be the same after my unilateral salpingectomy.  Even though the diagnostic test missed the hydrosalpinx, I still felt confident with his care. It took longer than anticipated but the end result was a pregnancy. I'm currently 31 weeks and am forever grateful for his care.We went to Dr. Freedman based on a recommendation.  However, we barely saw him or spoke to him.  He put us on some medications and supplements and then we had a retrieval 2 weeks later.  Both our retrievals resulted in eggs but they didn't fertilize.  However, after the second he said there is nothing he can do for us and we should look at adoption and/or donor eggs.  I spoke with other doctors who said that it would take a minimum of three months for the metphormin and supplements to fully make an effect on my body which he didn't give a chance.  When we went through the percentages in the beginning it wasn't until the third chance where we would reach a higher percentage chance.  We weren't given a proper explanation when we were told this almost a week after our retrieval (the week was the worst).  I believe the clinic is more concerned with their national success rates.Dr. Gutmann is very candid and thorough.  She is very blunt and straightforward, but underneath there is a wicked sense of humor, which both my husband and I appreciate.  Her personality fits well with us and we appreciate her ongoing collaboration in our treatment.  None supportive, None caring. She sent most of her messages through her nurse. Spoke to me via phone one time because it was protocol. If the process was successful or unsuccessful. You still expect your doctor to show some tact and not be so cold. Dr. Gutman was very knowledgeable but very, very cold in her delivery of any news. I guess it makes it easier to give people info. that way, but it's very weird none the less. Poor bedside manner overall. I feel like I did this a few questions ago... I like her, she answers questions, treats me as an individual, good sense of humor, seems to know what she's talking about, etc. I wish I could see her for all of my appointments for continuity, but I usually end up seeing a different Dr due to my cycle and the schedules of the Drs on call.Dr. Gutmann is a wonderful physician. She is knowledgeable, compassionate, understanding and patient. She is very empathic. She always explained what to expect. If there were any complications or concerns, she would explain what they were and the best course of action. She didn't hesitate to ask her colleagues for their opinion in my care, when needed which I respect and consider a sign of confidence in her abilities. She doesn't allow pride to keep her from getting answers for her patients to obtain the best care possible for them. As stated before,  RMA is fine if you have an easily fixable problem.  Otherwise,  RMA, and especially Castlebaum are content to just go through the motions and then immediately move to IVF when the typical treatments don't work.  Our least personal experience was with Castlebaum. Dr. Gutmann was very clear, thorough, and extremely knowledgeable. She was instantly able to answer every question we asked with specifics. Was is a bit blunt and will absolutely ""tell it like it is"" but I felt complete trust in her and felt very respected and 100% included as the non-gestational partner (my wife carried our child). Dr. Gutmann made herself very available to us over email at any time. We had a difficult situation regarding a non-viable pregnancy through the course of our journey, and though Dr. Gutmann was aware early on that it would almost certainly end up as non-viable, she gave us the information but didn't pressure us at all in making our own decision as to how to proceed. She is very, very queer-competent, and was super respectful in her language. I could not be happier in our choice to work with her, and hope to do so again when the time is right to try for a sibling!Dr. Guttman is very knowledgeable and up to date on latest research. I trust her medical advice but her communication is not good. She does not explain things in detail. For example, she just says ""looks good"". Other REs that I have seen in the same practice actually explain to you the ultrasound, what they see on the screen, not just ""looks good"". It is important to know for yourself what is going on because how else will you be able to make a decision. Dr. Gutmann is clearly very knowledgeable and skilled in this area.  She helped us make a plan that fit our lives and was very honest with us.  I appreciated this because I just wanted to know what to expect.  I was really thankful for her honesty when we hit an unexpected delay with our sperm donor.  She let us know what to expect, and then gave us space to make some decisions.  At times, her blunt responses were initially shocking, but it doesn't take you long to realize that she truly cares and also is quite funny!Dr. Gutman has a dry sense of humor and can be very brusque. I found this to be a positive about her personality - she never made the fertility treatments feel precious. Her personality demystified treatments and made the whole fertility process seem more ""normal."" She's honest about what to expect and what statistics around pregnancy are for each treatment type. When planning your treatment she takes multiple factors into consideration including your fertility Heath, of course, but also your finances, your reaction to drugs, and your access to sperm, for example. I've always felt very taken care of by the doctor. I have no complaints - I wish she were my primary physician, too.Dr. Castelbaum is a very experienced, knowledgeable, caring, and personable doctor. He is straightforward about his decisions and doesn't shy away from giving bad news when he needs to. He takes the time to answer questions during appointments and will schedule consults as needed. He is very responsive by email, as are the nurses who work at RMA.My wife and I originally went for me to get inseminated and after many heartbreaks we turned to Dr. Castlebaum for my wife's insemination. After two iui procedures she became pregnant with our son. After the nurse called with the results he followed up with my wife to express his excitement. After Tatum was born we sent Dr. Castlebaum a birth announcement he again called us to express his delight and tell us how adorable our son is. To him it is not a job he genuinely wants you to have a baby and just wants to help you along your journey. We had been to another place where all I can describe it as is being cattle herded we were literally just a number and a paycheck and with no fertility coverage that's not what you want. Dr. Castlebaum makes you feel like part of his family and when you're struggling to have a baby that is so important. Please visit question number one about being treated as human. My experience as a patient of hers was amazing.  When she noticed my health taking a turn for the worse, she asked me to come in for  weekly checkups, consulted with an oncologist, and worked with another clinical team to figure out how to help me get better. In person, Dr. Freedman is great, answers your questions, and is very calming. However, as questions started to arise, it began to feel as though more information should have been shared and more options discussed. The communication was really our biggest issue, as we never really understood why certain treatments were being administered or what more could have been done. We met wth Dr. Gutmann on a handful of occasions, although we rarely saw her for monitoring appointments or heard from her otherwise (all communication is through the nursing staff). Dr. Gutmann is an intelligent physician with exceptional training and expertise in the field. Unfortunately, she lacks a warm bedside manner. Her reaction to our miscarriages at the practices was robotic and jarring. Ultimately, we decided to switch practices because of this. As our case became more complicated, we needed someone with a more gentle touch and we wanted to have more contact with a single physician. My husband and I went through over two years of fertility treatment before welcoming our daughter. This included an IUI cycle that resulted in the premature birth and loss of a son at 22 weeks of pregnancy, three ectopic pregnancies during subsequent monitored and/or IUI cycles, removal of my Fallopian tubes, and one cycle of IVF. Through it all, Dr. Gutmann was patient, caring, compassionate, and encouraging. Her wet sense of humor helped us through even the darkest of days, and her clear and concise communication style helped us understand our current plan. There aren't words to express how thankful we are to have had her guidance and expertise as we worked through each failure and ultimately found success. We have been through a lot of ups and downs in Dr. Nguyen's care. On the compassion scale she gets a 10 out of 10 every time. I have needed to seek outside resources to better explain protocols at times, but she does a great job of explaining the basics and nurse consults have always filled in the gaps. She is not one to push for excessive testing when not called for, but does listen and supports patients needs. She is a very scrupulous and skilled provider.   Dr. Nguyen is a very sweet and kind person.  I felt like she was a friend throughout the process and not just my doctor.  At my first ultrasound where we saw I was pregnant with twins, she gave me a big hug.  I could tell she was genuinely excited for my husband and me. Dr. Gutman was fantastic. She was very direct, which I appreciated, and she did a great job of managing my expectations. She also managed to explain complicated things clearly and in non-medical terms. I truly felt like I was in the best hands.Dr. Gutman was compassionate, but realistic, which we appreciated. In a good way, there was no sugarcoating. She was patient with us as we slowly accepted our need for more aggressive fertility treatments in order to have the family we imagined. All the while, she provided clear explanations about procedures and helped us understand our options.Dr. Gutmann has a matter-of-fact manner, which is not quite warm, but conveys her impressive intelligence and experience.  She was always upfront and honest with us.  She explained everything we needed to do clearly, and was always on top of our care.  She was also completely willing to help us conceive in the manner we desired; we wanted to use my partner's eggs and donor sperm and I wanted to carry out the pregnancy.  She was completely supportive of our wishes and was able to help us conceive as we planned.Dr. Castelbaum is an incredibly intelligent, capable and appreciative doctor. I want to start with that when I came back to visit with both my boys he was so genuinely touched, held each kid and truly appreciates the miracles he brings into the world.
He is very straight forward with his information and also doesn't make assumption or judgments. I came from another clinic with unsuccessful IVF cycles and was referred to egg donation. I switched clinics for a 2nd opinion and Dr. Castelbaum was shocked that my previous doctor hadn't don't any type of testing on me to determine why my cycles weren't producing many eggs and why the ones retrieved were abnormal. He immediately ran some testing and did ultimately agree that egg donation was my best bet at having children while being able to experience pregnancy. He's very fact based and delivers matter-of-factly so you have to be okay with that but he also has a warm bedside manner. I loved him and would refer anyone to him. . She is a competent physician. She is well read, very thorough and doesn't rush. Her wait time is minimal. She explained everything thoroughly. She is good with procedures. You want 200 characters but I can't think of anything else Doctor Freedman is one of the kindest and most empathetic doctors I have ever had.  It was a long process, however from my first consult I knew I was in the right hands.  Every set back we had, I never doubted my doctor and knew we would have the end result we had been waiting for. I can't recommend him enough. I generally had good interactions with Dr. Freedman. I rarely saw or spoke to him during my cycles, but I saw him each time at pregnancy ultrasounds. During ultrasound appointments it often seemed like he was busy, which I am sure he was.I wish I would see Dr. Freedman more often as well as hear from him throughout a cycle. I know he is making decisions behind the scenes, but I usually only hear about them through the nursing team. He makes small adjustments as needed, but I'm not always aware of what those changes are expected to accomplish.Dr. Castelbaum is great. I can not think of a negative even when I probably should be contacting the nurse, if I contact Dr. he always answer my question without hesitation. I have had no disappointments and I have always been treated with respect. Dr. Castelbaum makes me feel very comfortable in not so comfortable situations.Dr. Castelbaum has a wonderful personality that matched my wife and I so well. He is clearly knowledgeable and was honest with us about his recommendations. He was willing to hear our concerns and seemed to genuinely care about us during the process. The infertility process is hard. We went through it for many years and had to adjust course a number of times. Dr. G was a huge asset to our care. If we had a doctor that we liked less, we might have been tempted to change, but she was kind and realistic. She was clear and accessible. She is extremely knowledgable and is an expert in the field.She's just the best!
Really knows her stuff, explains it well, doesn't sugar coat, but isn't harsh. Personable without being unprofessional. I was at RMA 219 times in my time there and everytime i knew she was in the office I felt relived and happy to know i was under her care and that I got the chance to talk with her. Dr. Freedman was totally invested in our success. He seemed to want things to go as well as we did at every stage of the process.  He was always professional, super caring, knowledgeable, and always made sure we understood what was going on.Dr. Freedman was thorough with our first meeting about how the process worked, etc.  He was kind and comforting and if we visited another doctor and he was unsure with the results or response he would reach out immediately and make any necessary changes.  After our last failed transfer, he reached out to me with a plan for going forward that we could discuss when we were ready.  Not ever pushy. She is a good advocate, competent with both medical and procedural aspects of infertility medicine. My success was limited in part to the fact that my insurance coverage was limited and affordable injection medicine was not available to me Dr. Gutmann is straightforward and honest. She doesn’t sugar coat. She’s clinical and factual. She has a great balance of compassion and empathy. She’s trustworthy and knowledgeable. She advocates for the LGBTQ community. She is present in groups outside of RMA to help educate the community. We have been seeing Dr. Gutmann for almost a year. She is extremely knowledgeable and I trust her with my care. We have had a couple different procedures with her and she is always very professional. She is a little blunt and to the point but is compassionate as well, which I have found is a great mix for a doctor to have. She also took the time to call me personally after my failed cycles and to provide feedback on next steps. She came up with a new protocol for us which we were so thankful for. Overall, I would highly recommend her to anyone seeking help in conceiving. He made my husband & I feel comfortable right from the beginning. Unfortunately our insurance didn’t cover fertility and he was amazing every step of the way to help us and keep it as reasonable as possible. She was very pleasant and compassionate each time, however she didn't communicate well and never explained each step well or as to why we were doing it. I did like the fact that I saw her each visit and for my procedure. After my failed IUI she didn't seem bothered and basically said let's do it again. We didn't like that approach at all. He was thorough and very experienced. He was patient and considerate. He had a great bedside manner. He never made me feel bad about my infertility and always stayed positive and hopeful. He communicated regularly and always told my husband and I to reach out if we needed anything. Dr castelbaum is extremely empathetic and caring. He explained thoroughly his concerns with my pcos and extreme follicle growths and the chance of many multiples. He gave me choices and his input which I appreciated I enjoyed working with him in the mid 2000s, unfortunately I feel as though the merger of the practice decreased the quality of care.  Dr. Freedman seemed uninteresting in trying to continue to do iui with me and my inability to afford ivf caused a lack of care in my treatment.He was very compassionate to our struggle conceiving. When my insurance made it difficult to get the medications I needed they worked with me and gave me samples as they were able. My only qualm was having to travel around to many different offices between working full time.Dr. Guttman is extremely informed of current research and trends. 
She provides as much information as you ask her for--ask lots of questions if you want more info. She tends to regulate the information she gives on the patient's needs. And doesn't get tired on answering questions, ever. I'm glad that Dr. Freedman was my fertility Dr. He was understanding, informative, attentive and  punctual.  He spent adequate time with me during each visit .  He tailored a plan that  was  great for my condition (PCOS).Dr Guzman was great, very candid and to the point, I just felt like a number and our situation was not paid any attention. I had to call to check on the status of our charts, whether plans with our other doctors were communicated and the status of results and file updates. I want a doctor to dig deeper and I feel like he did not. He was helpful in getting us a reason for pregnancy not to be occurring and I feel he took the perfect first steps but as it didn’t work I think we should have been more aggressive in next steps. He was super compassionate as I was scared about all the firsts and he did a good job at explaining everything. Dr castlebaum is a great doctor. It’s too early in my treatment to really know what’s going on. I think he’s done a good job so far. I’m a little disappointed with how my last appointment went, only because there was information I’ve given him from the beginning and it felt like he never addressed it beforeSo far it has been an excellent experience. She has been very thoughtful and has been ordering tests for issues that were not previously followed up on by my prior doctor. She has been excellent with communicating with me and her office always follows up within 24 hoursAs I said, I am confident in her skills as a doctor, but her lack of empathy is very problematic.  She also doesn't seem to understand how expensive treatment is, and how stressful that can be.  She has clearly done this a lot knows her stuff.  She responds to emails in 1-2 days.Great doctor! Very compassionate and caring! Worked hard to achieve a pregnancy and was willing to try anything. Great bedside manner. Took the time to find out different treatment plans and ultimately wanted to help us achieve a pregnancy by any means. He explains everything the first visit, gives you options, and if things don’t work he reevaluates. Very kind and was just as happy that we were pregnant as we were! His office was awesome and the nurses were great. I loved everyone there. When I had to see other doctors or the nurse practitioner for procedures, they had the same bedside manner and were great She really listened to our struggles and wanted to make a realistic plan for us, not for her or the clinic. She was encouraging each step of the way and even encouraged us to apply for a grant (which we received!).Dr. Gutmann is stats driven; she sticks to what has shown to be probable to work and explains things on what is probable to be happening. In the end, it was effective and worked. I definitely felt empathy and appreciated her style. Dr Kallen does allow you to email and he will often return messages directly by phone if it is something pressing or important. He is very much a scientist and thinks about things in terms of percentages. Sometimes I think he knows what we should do next, but almost involves us too much in the decisions, but I am not sure if that is because both my fiancé and I are also doctors! Very good bedside manner and patience. Did not personalize my treatment or change protocol after multiple losses. Was willing to discuss other treatment options but would not prescribe himself. Referred to different doctors and forced to jump through hoops. I completely trust him and know that he is doing everything he possibly can to help me. He is extremely intelligent and experienced. I appreciate his bedside manner and also his sense of humor. Plus he is very gentle and patient He had great bedside manor. He explained everything very well and answered all of questions well. He called with lab results and recommendations. He was very personable. He talked to us like a human and not just another case.  He was great! I thought we had a great experience together, if i ever needed to discuss things he was always available. He always went over the procedures and what was at risk. He was also kind and caring. When i became pregnant he was so happy as was I! He told me to come back and visit before and after I have the baby.He was an incredible doctor and empathetic human being. I could not say enough wonderful things about him.We feel really lucky we found this place, we wish we would have sooner! When I first saw Dr Freedman, I thought he was very nice and I felt comfortable trusting him with my pregnancy. Maybe if you don’t know him too well you will think he doesn’t talk too much but when you know him more after a while, he is very kind and really cares about the patient. I always like to make him smile and laugh haha. Sometimes becoming pregnant is very hard, but when you trust the doctor and believe in yourself, it becomes easier. Now I’m 3 months pregnant, but I had some spotting around 9 weeks and pain 10 weeks and I sent a message to Dr Freedman and he responded very quickly each time, one time he called me on Christmas morning to say I can come to the office for an ultrasound, but everything was fine. I really appreciate that he was worried about me as much as the health of the pregnancy. I hope I can come back for my second pregnancy!I wish all I had to say was, schedule your appointment. But because of the struggle you and your partner have recently been faced with, I know how serious of a decision this is for you. While choosing a practice to help you start a family, ask yourself the following questions. Is it important that you be treated as a real person and receive personal care? Do you need flexibility when it comes to making appointments to work around your families busy schedule? Do you want updates and phone calls the same day as your office visits? Do you need to know that someone will ALWAYS be there to answer any question you have, no matter how major or minor? If you answered yes, then please, schedule your appointment today. My husband, my newborn son and I wish you and your partner the same experience we had. I have been a patient of Dr. Castelbaum for over 6 years.  My experiences with him have always been positive throughout those 6 years even if we received bad news.  I was never discouraged because he always has a Plan B!  He is patient and kind and willing to chat with me even if he has an office full of patients.  I have terrible eggs and he helped me conceive my 5 year old son and I am now pregnant again because of him.  When my daughter passed away from an umbilical cord accident very late in my pregnancy, he met with me ASAP just to talk to me.  I needed his advice and he made time and was there for me even though I wasn't a patient at the time.  He really is a wonderful doctor and we all consider him a part of our family.Between his amazingly prompt replies to questions by email/phone, his phenomenal breadth of knowledge and careful explanations, his sense of humor and warmth, and his gentle reassurance, I was so blessed to meet a Dr like Dr Freedman. I felt like he was a friend personally guiding me every step of the way.Dr. Castelbaum was confident, reassuring and diligent in my treatment plan. His optimism was contagious. I came to his office afraid and frustrated. I left feeling hopeful and inspired. When I saw  Dr. Castelbaum at the hospital for my HSG, I instantly felt relieved. She is no nonsense with a huge heart. I went in for
My 6 failed round of clomid and one failed IUI and she looked at me and asked what I wanted to do. I started to cry and said I needed a break and she gave me a hug and told me that was a good idea. She cares about her patients and she doesn’t waste your time. Dr. Guttman is very knowledgeable, responsive and caring. If you ask her a question she not only has an answer but will often relate it to what study the information is from. Her knowledge is very comforting in a scary process. She's done a fantastic job and as a result we're currently 9 weeks pregnant. We would absolutely recommend her to any friends or family.I felt very welcomed and cared for while there. She gave her diagnosis and treatment plan with a very direct answer. She was veery compassionate and understanding to our needs. If a treatment did not work, she would have a back up plan or offer to try again. She does not give up. Dr Freedman was very nice. He explained everything as it was going to happen. He was very thorough. He was also always on time. It was a nice clean facility and always had follow up calls. Great time. At first I was frustrated with communication, then we all realized they'd just switched over to a new email system. Dr. Castelbaum will answer emails the same day, often within a couple of hours, and once I could reach out that way I became very comfortable with care at RMA. Our situation was a really difficult and emotional one, but Dr. Castelbaum was really wonderful about being compassionate and giving us all the information and time we needed to make a decision we were comfortable with but that also gave us the best chance of having a child. Using an egg donor was a huge step, but once I was used to the idea, I was really glad we decided to do so. We got pregnant on our first cycle, currently 12 weeks.Dr. Casselbaum was very personable during our consult and at each ultrasound appointment that we had.  He explained the steps and how the process would work.  He answered all of my questions and dealt with my anxiety of being nervous over everything.  When he had to tell us that there was not a heartbeat, he was sensitive and used his experience to basically tell us that it would not work out, which I appreciated.  In terms of anxiety, I felt like he gave a lot of information - sometimes I do not need to know everything!  However, that is just me and others may feel differently.  The only time I got frustrated was waiting for my period to come after the loss.  After a month and a half, I called the office to advocate for myself and they adjusted the treatment right away.  I was also monitored very closely after the loss, which I appreciated.  I am currently pregnant now and was able to stay with Dr. Casselbaum for 9 weeks.  He continued to let me come for the ultrasound even though he was confident I could go back to my gyn at 7 weeks.  He knew I needed that weekly reassurance for as long as possible.I didn’t always see Dr Freedman in person because the Center City office was more convenient for me (he worked out of the suburban offices). Occasionally it seemed like I had to be in charge of knowing what cycle I was on and what the plan was next. However, after several cycles without result I made a consult appointment, and he did take the time to sit down with my husband and I for half an hour to discuss our treatment plan, after which I felt much better. He was also very responsive via phone when on call. We've been using RMA and Dr. C since 2014 and if you are seeking fertility treatments, you are also seeking expertise, compassion, and facts.  In total, we've completed one IUI, one egg retrieval procedure, and five frozen embryo transfers.  We had two births, one miscarriage, one unsuccessful transfer, and are currently expecting our third.  It's a rollercoaster and Dr. C has always been informative and never gives false hope.  Our first transfer was successful, but after a failed transfer and a miscarriage, we regrouped with Dr. C to discuss options for the remaining embryos because it was getting expensive and emotionally taxing.  Dr. C provided us with the research, facts, and risks with genetic testing the remaining embryos and ultimately left the decision up to us.  After we decided to move forward with testing, Dr. C supported it and it resulted in another birth and we are currently pregnant.  He often talks about how enjoys his ongoing relationships with his patients, we are repeat customers over five years and despite our various journey with each transfer, Dr. C has guided us with the information we needed to make the best choice for us.  He might appear too direct for some, but when you are making life decisions that are emotionally and financially taxing, you want truth, not someone pushing you in one direction or another, or providing a false sense of what might be.I really cannot thank Dr. Castelbaum enough for his help. Each failed IUI was very difficult, but it helped to know he was just as invested in the process. I think his genuine joy when we confirmed my pregnancy made a huge difference; healthy babies and families really matter to him. 

I also can't express how excellent his bedside manner is. He has a way of being extremely professional yet warm and supportive. I am typically not comfortable with male doctors, and this type of care can be especially uncomfortable with a man, but he couldn't have made me feel more comfortable throughout the process. Dr. Castelbaum takes the time and effort to connect with each couple. Our insurance did not cover fertility. We started with 3 months of Clomid and no luck. We had become pregnant 1 month after having HSG but lost baby due to Turners Syndrome. After taking a few month break we tried 2 cycles of Clomid and on 3rd cycle paired it with an IUI. At this time Dr. C revisited the conversation of IVF. During that visit I had him that my husband and I have never considered. We’ve had more conversations based around adoption prior to this visit. Thankfully my husband and I decided to move forward with IVF and Dr. C was very informative and the staff as well. Both my retrieval and transfer fell on days where Dr. C was in KOP surgical center. We were fortunate to retrieve a lot of eggs and create 12 embryos. Our first transfer stuck and we are blessed with the happiest three month old baby boy! I would recommend him to friends, families and strangers.. he is THE BEST at what he does! And his offices are full of great people/nurses. Thank you Dr. C!Dr Castelbaum is extremely knowledgeable in this field and is able to explain everything to us ""newbies"" in a way that we would understand. Every visit felt like a meeting with a friend, not just a doctor who was treating a patient. I felt like he CARED about my success not just for office numbers but for my own future and well being. I trusted every decision he suggested during my care and truly believed that he wanted to see me with a healthy pregnancy. I was so upset to leave the practice after my ""safe mark"" to join my OB as I loved everything about RMA Langhorne. Dr. Castelbaum was really easy for my husband and I to connect with. His humor and energy around the ""science"" aligned with how we work. This isn't for everyone, but it worked really well for us. He answered my questions before I asked them, and he was genuinely happy for us when we ""graduated.""Overall it was very good, even during the first visit they did an ultra sound and bloodwork right away, he also told us of the entire plan during our first visit which I liked. He was very friendly and made each visit easier then I expected. He was also very positive which was good. I found out 14 years ago that I have PCOS and from then worried I may never carry my own child. My husband and I spent a few years trying on our own until we finally asked for a recommendation to a fertility specialist and were sent to Dr. Castelbaum. From the first meeting I was instantly comfortable. Before seeing bloodwork, medical records or doing any type of exam, he knew right away how to help and was so confident. He was kind, gentle in telling me the things I knew I needed to hear and told me he was going to help me reach my goal. For the first time I felt it was possible and my dream of becoming a mother was going to happen. 
Through all of the treatment, which was an emotional rollercoaster I could have never prepared for, he and his staff were beyond amazing. They explained every step of the way, comforted me when I cried, greeted me with a huge smile every visit like I was their only patient and kept me going. And I can now say I am almost three months pregnant!! The only downside is that I don’t get to go to his office anymore as I have now “graduated” as Dr. Castelbaum puts it. I cannot say enough wonderful things about he and his staff and my husband and I will forever be so grateful for them. Again, Dr. Freedman was compassionate and caring! He gave me hope during times that I wanted to give up. When I felt nervous about a few things during the course of treatments, he eased my fears and helped me feel comfortable as possible. Trustworthy and doesn’t give up.  Always has answers and is up front and honest.  Doesn’t treat you like a statistic and has a an made just for you.   I wouldn’t trust any other doctor as much as a trust him.  He also allows you to be your own advocate and takes your computer ferns seriously Every visit with Dr Castelbaum was very personal. He greeted me by name and referred back to prior conversations had in previous appointments. He is very knowledgable and has a great bedside manner. I felt that he answered every question how he would want to hear it and not as a doctors answer. I VERY HIGHLY recommend Dr Castelbaum! Dr. Gutmann's style is not stereotypically warm and fuzzy, but it really clicked for me. She was willing to explain anything and make a recommendation but left the decisions up to us, with no pressure. She has a great dry humor, remembered some details about my personal life, and mainly showed she cared through a detailed treatment plan, and being super responsive with constant monitoring/adjustments in the lead-up to retrieval.

Monitoring visits & even transfer day were provided by a rotating team of doctors and NPs. I saw at least 5 in a single, well-monitored IVF cycle. Initially I was disappointed that Dr. Gutmann didn't personally, but I ended up feeling more knowledgeable thru the mix of different styles. Some talked millimeters and probability, others were great at giving a sneak peek at next few steps, everyone was 100% dialed on my records. Emails were returned very quickly, sometimes within the hour. Dr. Nguyen made sure to address all of my concerns without making me feel stupid for asking. She seemed genuinely interested in my feelings throughout the entire process. The staff, including Dr. Castelbaum always made me feel like a priority. They always welcomed my son in the office during my 2nd cycle, even helping to watch him while I was being seen. They always knew me, my background, my family and the current status of my cycle. They worked around my schedule and always fit me in. They tried their best to make my cycles the most cost effective they could and I honestly couldn't say enough good things about any of them from reception, nurses, billing, and of course, Dr. Castelbaum. I remember being especially stressed and crying, and he sat with me.She spent almost an hour going over our previous treatments. She answered our questions throughly and never once rushed us through any of our appointments The whole staff was really great made feel not so nervous as I started the process. I wished Dr. Fossum was still my RE. Dr. Guttman clearly cared about my wife and helping us succeed in becoming parents.The staff were really nice. During our visits Dr. Lange was very welcoming and talked to us about our specific case. Our second IUI ended in an ectopic pregnancy. Dr. Lange sat with us and explained everything that was happening and comforted us. She also called after to check in on us following the procedure and creating a new plan. I felt treated like a human. She took time to explain the plan and seemed to truly care about our results.Prior to being treated by Dr. Schlaff, I was seen at a different clinic where I rarely saw or spoke with my main physician and was seen by different doctors, nurses, and ultrasound techs at each visit. I was seen at this prior clinic over the course of two years for 4 IUIs and 2 IVF cycles (none successful) and saw my original doctor a total of 3 times. This was my baseline experience with infertility treatment prior to deciding to switch clinics. From the very first time I met Dr. Schlaff, I knew my experience would be different. Dr Schlaff took the time to get to know my partner and me and our long history with secondary infertility. He was able to provide insight into many of our unanswered questions from our prior IVF clinic and recommended we see his staff clinical psychologist prior to deciding if and how to proceed with treatment. The emotional and mental aspect of our treatment was never addressed or considered at the prior clinic. Throughout my time with Dr. Schlaff, he called me personally multiple times to discuss results, provide updates, and offer support. He was always available to answer questions we had and was warm while also being direct. I felt that he and everyone else in the clinic got to know us throughout our treatment and were all in our corner the whole time.Not only Dr. Gutman, but her entire staff were gentle, but not so gentle that I felt they were incompetent. Dr. Gutman is so incredibly passionate about endocrinology and you can tell when you talk to her that she genuinely wants to see you succeed. I never once had to wait long for results and all of my questions were answered - they even didn't mind corresponding via email, which is my preferred method. They made sure I completely understood the entire process and the 'why' behind each step. They also were up front about the odds - no false promises about whether or not it would work. They have an entire financial team dedicated to finding the best options for you and take care when selecting medication, since we are paying 100% out of pocket.It was kind of neutral. Some days I felt unimportant because he never elaborates, but when I have needed answers and pushed for me, he has provided that for me.While I've seen other doctors for monitoring and gotten test results from nurses, Dr. Guttman herself has always checked in with me regularly to explain next steps and answer any questions. Even though I dont get to see her in person often due to my schedule, I've never felt like she didn't know who I was or what was going on.I could never get in contact with him when it came to important results from diagnostic test nor with figuring out my medication dosages and whether my upcoming cycle would be monitored/un-monitored.At every visit I was greeted by my first name as soon as I walked in the door. Dr Castelbaum always made me feel important during every appointment. I never felt rushed during any visit and always took the time to answer any questions or concerns I had.I felt like a human because every time I had questions or concerns Dr Lange would personally reach out to me via phone or in person and explain in detail what was going on. She did not push the work off to a nurse or anyone else. I would ask her what she would do in certain circumstances and she would be honest and tell me what she felt she would do and why. She is very compassionate and recommended different tests that she thought we help me during my treatment. I feel like she didn’t jump into doing anything until we had all our ducks in a row. She truly is one of the nicest doctors I have dealt with over the past 3 years and an overall genuine and kind person.Dr. Gutmann was always very warm and determined to help me achieve my dreams of becoming a mother.  She is very straight forward and honest when answering questions, but always was there responding to my anxieties and helping me through this often stressful process.  She always communicated with me and made sure I was aware of the next steps and had all of the support I needed through each IUI process.  She also went above and beyond helping me fight some insurance issues that started midway through my treatments. Her bedside manner is amazing.At first, I felt like a human as Dr. Guttman greeted us in the waiting room. After taking us into her office she mostly went through her computer and reviewed the information we had already submitted online. She listened to our questions but I got the impression from her that “she’s heard it all”. I felt like she treated us somewhere between a number and a human. I felt like I was in a processing plant. At first I thought I liked Dr Castelbaum, but then I realized I didn’t feel comfortable with his demeanor. I felt like the office staff and nurses were often upset about something and our presence or questions were annoying them. Dr. Castelbaum is one of the warmest, most caring doctors I have ever met.  He was extremely compassionate and empathetic to the situation happening with me and my partner.  He explained everything clearly, has an incredible bedside manner, and genuinely cares about his patients.  He is a wonderful man and doctor to work with.Dr. G struck the perfect balance of warm yet clearly well researched. She always started with a check in and often a joke, then dove into the science of what she was seeing.I have been to two different facilities. The first one was like a meat market; standing room only and unless you had some news worthy fertility problem, you never saw the physicians, you always saw a nurse or a PA. At RMA I saw a Physician every time I went, and I was made to feel important. If I had to wait, I never minded because I knew the wait was due to them wanting to give every patient the same respect, time, and quality appointment.I felt like a human. He is very down to earth and goes out of his way to speak directly with his patients, even on a a weekend.Dr. Gutmann answered all of my questions thoroughly.  She is rather clinical about the diagnostic process as well as when she explained various intervention options.  However, she clearly is competent and passionate. Dr. Castelbaum seemed to genuinely care  and was always optimistic. He took the time to answer any questions me or my husband had. He thoroughly explained every step of the treatments he performed. we were in and out and although dr freedman and guttman knew us, the rest were nice but were like an assembly line. Dr. Gutmann and the staff have been great in communicating and answering questions.  For our current treatment cycle she has agreed to do a mock Natural FET which is something she normally doesn't do but has agreed to let us try.  She is willing to collaborate with us while giving us her professional recommendation.  For such a personal process I consider Dr. Gutman and her team very impersonal and not very caring. When you first go to RMA the entire team, from the receptionist to the doctors to the finance team advises you, ""We will take care of you"".""Once you pay, you can come through anytime you want"" However, it seems that as soon as you hand over your money, they forget you literally. A nurse is assigned to you when you go to RMA who is supposed to provide info. to Dr. Gutman about your case. However, everytime except for once when I have called I have spoken to a different nurse and every time they seem to somehow kinda conveniently forget that you are a patient. Dr. Gutman may know her medical stuff but, she seems to only want to deal one on one with patients when a check is involved. When there is not there is no follow-up, no explanation, and no support. I really like Dr Gutmann. She's present when I'm with her, I think she definitely considers me as an individual in my treatment, she answers my questions, she has a sense of humor, and she's empathetic. 
My only issue is it's hard to actually see her. An appointment takes a while to get if I want to talk to her/reassess. I usually end up seeing one of the other Drs on call when I go due to my cycle and the Drs schedules. Dr. Gutmann has been very invested in giving me the best possible chance of success. She has always gone the extra mile to respond to my questions and anxieties. She has called and emailed me directly, and she has helped me when I miscarried. She's been encouraging without sugar coating the odds. She's always been honest. Dr. Castlebaum immediately suggested IVF after we had gotten pregnant with our most recent IVF. The manner in which he discussed it was very cavalier and detached. When we finally asked about IVF packages and what he suggested for our situation, his response was ""I always like a money back plan, "" as if we were purchasing material goods. This was a huge turnoff and a big reason for leaving RMA altogether.  Dr. Gutmann was a godsend. She did a fantastic job of communicating with us throughout a very long and draining process. She was extremely responsive, including replying to emails outside of business hours, and answered all of our many detailed questions.Each person reacts differently to the medication and there are things that should change after reflecting or taking into account what worked and didn't work last cycle. Unfortunately, I didn't feel that this was being done. It felt like a one size fits all kind of approach.Dr. Gutmann remembers details about your life and is very personable.  She's blunt, but very caring. While going through a procedure, I was visibly uncomfortable, and she had amazing bedside manners.  She ensured I was ok, and definitely tended to me until she knew I was comfortable again.Dr. Gutman was always clear about what to expect from the fertility treatments - she has a positive outlook without ever giving me false hope. She also had an air of authority while still making me feel comfortable to ask questions. At my last consultation I asked her what I felt was a stupid question about cervical mucus and she answered me without a hint of condescension and said, ""Don't hold back your questions until a consultation. If there is something worrying you, you can call anytime."" Her dry sense of humor makes me laugh every time I see her, but I never feel like she is holding something back that I need to know. Most importantly​, I always feel like she is tailoring my treatment to my specific fertility and financial needs. This has never felt like a one-size-fits-all process with Dr. Gutman.Dr. Castelbaum and the RMA staff are busy, but take the time to greet and talk with everyone. This is especially true in the surgery center--the nurses there are truly kind and caring. The office usually runs on time and seems to prioritize getting patients in and out of the office within a reasonable amount of time. If there is something you need, they will put you in touch with the right person to get your questions answered.I am in a same sex marriage and he listens to everything we have said along the way we even went to another doctor for Ivf and when we returned to him for my wife to get iui all he wanted to know was if we were successful at the other office. He's amazing and we will never seek care from anyone else again!I work in the clinical field. Therefore, I expect doctors to be upfront about test results and expectations. Initially, Dr. Gutmann was upfront about expectations, especially after receiving previous my test results, and OP results. As time progressed, she soften, and became very encouraging. When she noticed my health taking a turn for the worse, she asked me to come in for  weekly checkups, consulted with an oncologist, and worked with another clinical team to figure out how to help me get better. At RMA, you are not always treated by the same doctor,  although Freedman generally ""oversaw"" each cycle. Still, he often forgot how many cycles we'd done or which procedures we'd done. We never discussed IUI in detail at first  but got the call to ""come in for insemination."" It felt like there was a lot missing in terms of communication. The way that RMA of Philadelphia works is that, while you have one doctor overseeing your care, you are part of a practice with five locations in the area. The doctors switch locations every day. When I first I went to RMA at the beginning of 2016, there were 7 doctors. By the time we finally decided to switch practices 13 months later, 3 had left and there were only 4. Suffice it to say, 4 doctors cannot cover all 5 practice locations. As a result, you are seen by different doctors at each appointment, rarely see ""your"" doctor, often see a sonographer, and (in addition) you don't have an assigned nurse. I would receive updates on pregnancy monitoring and next steps by personnel I had never met at locations I had never been to. As a result, you feel like you are part of a machine instead of like a human being.Dr. Gutmann individualized treatment each cycle. Each time we failed, she would call - no matter the time of day or the day of the week - to review what had happened and plan next steps. She was sympathetic and helped us maintain a positive attitude through some very difficult losses. She never once made us think she she didn't believe we'd ultimately find success. My ""chemical pregnancy"" during IUI was actually presumed ectopic and my ""miscarriage"" from a PGS IVF fresh cycle was unfortunately a termination for medical reason at 21weeks. We received a non-compatible with life fetal diagnosis at our 19 week anatomy scan. I wasn't sure how best to mark this loss on the survey.... My daughter could have survived to full term, but had a prognosis of living for only a few minutes to days at most after birth. 

Even though I was no longer in Dr. Nguyen's care at the time in my pregnancy, she called me the day after diagnosis as soon as she was informed by Maternal Fetal medicine. My regular OB has not demonstrated the same level of compassion and care that Dr. Nguyen has consistently given me and my husband as we have struggled with infertility and pregnancy loss. It is a small office. Dr. Nguyen is efficient, but always makes sure if she does not have the time to answer your questions at a monitoring appointment, a nurse will follow up before you leave. She has gone out of her way to schedule consults for us when needed and they have always been within a week of our initial request. She and her staff are a big reason my husband and I felt comfortable continuing with FET cycles after the devastating loss of our daughter and why we have not given up on having a biological child altogether.  Dr Gutmann was always realistic but hopeful. She was empathetic when we were sad and frustrated but also helped us to set realistic expectations. There was conversation between Dr. Gutmann and us, not just dry clinical conversation. She also genuinely seemed to be on the ride with us, wanting us to succeed. When our first cycle failed, she called with condolences and I believe she truly was heartbroken for us. She knows what her science can do for families, bringing love into this world, and I felt she was honestly disappointed when things didn't go the way we all wanted them to.I am part of a same-sex couple, and my spouse and I wanted to use her eggs and donor sperm to conceive, and then transfer to me to carry out the pregnancy.  Dr. Gutmann was open, informative, welcoming, and non-judgmental throughout this process.  She understood our situation and worked with us to achieve the family we wanted.At first, I felt that she really wanted to help me. After I didn't get results and my lack of insurance to cover injections, I felt like I was a less interesting patient. Also, one time she said it was because I waited too long. That was a very unfair statement. I didn't wait too long to try infertility treatment on purpose. I didn't have insurance and I had other personal issues that interfered with pursuing fertility. I still believe I can get pregnant. I am also disappointed that she didn't recommend acupuncture early on or start me on metforminDoctor Freedman was empathetic the entire process, and explained every step of the way with us. We had a few setbacks and he was always optimistic our end result would be pregnancy. You often see different nurses and doctors at your appointments. Dr. Freeman returned my direct messages, but nurses communicated the majority of the time. Several times Dr. Freedman has called late at night to discuss results and discuss next steps.Dr. Castelbaum has all my information ready for me. Anytime I ask a question he has an answer for me and does not go looking through notes he knows my situation and I by face.Dr. Castelbaum has been warm, friendly, kind, and funny. He made a point to ask about what my wife and I did for living and seemed to recognize us and remember us during our meetings. He was also very affirming of us as a same-sex couple. She was very kind and understanding about our frustrations during the fertility process. We were frustrated at our lack of success, but we stuck it out and she never gave up on us. Ultimately, we were successful and we loved having Dr. G as our physician the entire time.Dr. Gutmann is amazing. Personal, but straight forward and no nonsense. we also discussed personal lives and she got to know usDr Freedman took the time to get to know us personally.  He made personal phone calls to us at home, he was always a pleasure to interact with even when the news wasn't good.  We were so inspired we went back with our blessing and a gift for him. The news we received after the transfer was not what we wanted. However, he was positive, optimistic and comforting. She was very determined and committed to helping me get pregnant Treated like a human.
Treated with respect and compassion. Questioned answered promptly. Nurses are amazing. I can’t say enough good about Gutmann and RMA phila Dr Castelbaum was truly amazing. He made my husband & I feel as comfortable as possible.He always stressed the positives and placed no blame on me or my husband. He was thorough and explained everything in a way that was easy to understand.Extremely compassionate. Took time to go over results and the effects of my PCOSIn the beginning, I felt like a human and had my son in 2006.  The office merged and when I returned for a second child, I felt unheard and more like a numberDr. Guttman was very attentive, and adapted to my needs in how she treated me. She was especially supportive and empathetic if I was ever in pain during a test or procedure, she checked in on me regularly and didn't rush when I asked additional information about further research and context. Dr Freedman was attentive, informative and honest. He made me feel as if my care was a priority and that i mattered.The office was always packed, and I frequently waited more than an hour. I felt like we had to describe our situation in detail every time, which was painful.He is very kind and supportive. Definitely on the side of his patients but also factual and realistic. So as much as he wanted it for us, he could not control the outcome. I felt comfortable and like he understoodDr. Guttman is very smart and very thorough but she is not very warm or empathetic and seems to lack an appreciation for how emotionally challenging this process can be.Very good Bed side manner. Caring and compassionate He was kind and explained everything thoroughly. I wasn’t another number. Dr. Nguyen was very personable and made plans with me, for my situation, not just regular IVF.Whenever we had the opportunity to speak with Dr. Gutmann, she always took the time to answer our questions and encouraged us to ask even the questions that felt most absurd. I appreciated the time she took to help us feel informed. However, common practice was for a nurse to be the one calling us with important test results or treatment instructions, and oftentimes they were not able to answer basic questions or, sometimes, we were given incorrect information. Good bedside manner. Did not personalize my care or protocol. He took the time to review everything about my husband and me thoroughly They knew who I was when I was calling. The greeted me by my first name when entering the office. They new my case well.I felt like a human, because they always greeted me by my nameI was very likely one of many, many patients he saw on a regular basis but with each encounter he made me feel like he knew me and he had a personal stake in our dream and our success. He was rooting for me. He personally called me at home the night I finally found out I was pregnant. Sometimes he was quick to go to the next patient, but he always stayed and answered my questions and even set aside over an hour for consultations several times. He always answered my emails very quickly and even called to make sure I was doing ok.I could go on and on. Once you meet her, you’ll understand. I was SO nervous at our first appointment in April of 2019, but the second I sat in her office and she never lost eye contact with me and was clear and calm, I was hooked. The connection was REAL. Dr. Castelbaum is the best doctor I have ever had.  He and his staff are ALWAYS warm and kind.  I always felt comfortable and at home in his office even though I was going through some of the hardest days of my life.  Dr Freedman is the single greatest dr I’ve ever met. He treated me like more than human- I couldn’t imagine one treating one’s own daughter with more genuine kindness, compassion, and warmth. He answered every question patiently and made me feel so personally cared for! He called me at home, responded to emails almost instantly, reassured me when things were rough, calmed my fears,  and was there for me in every way conceivable. He personally called to share the news with so much joy in his voice when we got pregnant! I cried on the day we were discharged and my OB doesn’t hold a candle to Dr Freedman.From the receptionist to the nurses to Dr. Castlebaum, everyone made you feel like you were their only patient.  Dr. guttman explained everything so i would understand without making it seem “dumbed down”. She listened to my concerns and did whatever i wanted to try.She was very understanding and caring. Any time I had a concern or question, it was always answered within minutes, even when they were busy with morning testing. Everyone knew me by name and made sure I was comfortable. The front desk and nursing staff always made a point of making sure I didn't have to wait too long, and the doctors were great about answering questions and making me feel comfortable. I was never rushed into a decision. Dr. Casselbaum took the time to answer all of my questions.  He remembered where I worked and he remembered our previous loss.  I did not feel like I was refreshing his memory at every appointment.The office staff were always kind and remembered you personally (especially RMA Center City office where I went most often). Even though I saw multiple doctors through RMA, they were all kind and took the time to talk with you.All the doctors at RMA have their own way of showing compassion while also being realistic.  I never felt like a number.Dr. Castelbaum cared. I was not just rushed through appointments, it was not all just about numbers on a chart. He genuinely wants to help people grow their families and have healthy, successful pregnancies. He made me feel comfortable in an otherwise uncomfortable situation. Dr. C is extremely effective with his communication skills and a very compassionate person/doctor.Dr Castelbaum was an amazing doctor to work  WITH. I never felt like he knew more than me or treated me like I was less than. I came in extremely anxious after a recent miscarriage and he reassured me the entire duration of my care that he would do everything to give me a healthy happy pregnancy and baby. I never felt like a number, I felt like a friend.Always knew who I was at every appointment, including my name, my husband's name, our history, and what stage we were at. He anticipated my questions before i asked them because he knew how i was thinking throughout the process.He was always very pleasant, made small jokes to make us feel more comfortable, spent enough time with us, answered all our questions and listened to what we wanted to do. Every single time my husband and I walked in we were greeted with huge smiles from Dr. Castelbaum and the staff. They always knew our names and treated us like family. Dr. Freedman was great! He was the doctor who helped me achieve both pregnancies. He treated me so compassionately and always cares about my well being. He always remembered my history and made me feel so at ease throughout the whole process. I actually went back to him to pursue a third pregnancy. Before I started treatment for that, I ended up miraculously getting pregnant in my own! He wa so caring that he still have me blood tests and early ultrasounds before discharging me to by OB, just to make sure everything was still okay! I recommend him to family and friends!You have to learn to trust your doctor.  Dr. Castelbaum does not treat you like a number, but at times I have found him to be so serious, when I really wanted a doctor who would just tell me it would be ok reassure me.  Ultimately his bed side manner is what every woman needs going through fertility.  I want facts and I want answers.  I want to know that he has a plan and won’t give up.  He never did Every visit i had with Dr. Casselbaum was very personal. He addressed me by my name and referred back to conversations we had in previous appointments. ",8.5,8.5,"Dr. Allison Lange was very knowledgeable and thorough when she created our treatment plan. She understood how crazy the back and forth almost daily visits at times for monitoring could be and did her best to take my life/work schedule into consideration. We went to her for a second opinion and she discussed different ways she would change our current fertility regimen. I found this to be a positive about her personality - she never made the fertility treatments feel precious. I could tell she was genuinely excited for my husband and me. I switched clinics for a 2nd opinion and Dr. Castelbaum was shocked that my previous doctor hadn't don't any type of testing on me to determine why my cycles weren't producing many eggs and why the ones retrieved were abnormal. He tailored a plan that  was  great for my condition (PCOS).Dr Guzman was great, very candid and to the point, I just felt like a number and our situation was not paid any attention. He has a way of being extremely professional yet warm and supportive. Thank you Dr. C!Dr Castelbaum is extremely knowledgeable in this field and is able to explain everything to us ""newbies"" in a way that we would understand. The staff, including Dr. Castelbaum always made me feel like a priority. Dr. Guttman clearly cared about my wife and helping us succeed in becoming parents. Dr. Gutman is so incredibly passionate about endocrinology and you can tell when you talk to her that she genuinely wants to see you succeed. She did not push the work off to a nurse or anyone else. For our current treatment cycle she has agreed to do a mock Natural FET which is something she normally doesn't do but has agreed to let us try. She also had an air of authority while still making me feel comfortable to ask questions."
64,RMA of Philadelphia,advice,"Well he moved on to surgical and high risk patients.One piece of advice would be to go in with an open mind. She will take the time to review your case and create a plan for you based on your specific needs or goals. If you have a question, ask it. Don't assume. She doesn't give much detail if you don't ask for it.  If you want to try something new, you need to start that conversation as well.  Do not hesitate to meet with him if you are thinking about undergoing fertility treatment.Trust the process. She is not a terribly warm individual, especially when you first meet her, but that's because she is still evaluating what the absolute best options are for you. Every time you talk to her, you will be reminded as to why you are in her care. She's great if you like someone who is straight and to the point - no sugarcoating bad news. It might be a long treatment, but she will be invested the entire time and is open to suggestions if you feel as though you'd like to try a different treatment which I appreciated! Ask for more information when you need it.See her.Don't waste your time and do not fall for the caring doctor that he acts like he is during your consultation. If your having trouble conceiving, see Dr Castelbaum. You won’t regret it!You are in good hands with a genuine and kind hearted physician that truly cares about her patients and developes a plan that works for you and if you have any questions or recommendations in your care she will take it into consideration and help as much as possible. Dr. Gutmann is straight forward when it comes to describing your care, potential issues, all of your potential options.  She doesn't sugar coat the facts, but she also lets you know she is here to help and fight with you through the entire process.  My percentages for a successful pregnancy were extremely low and she was up front with that, but also had a thorough game plan in place to beat those odds.  She is determined and very skilled at what she does.  No non-sense, not the warmest person but very knowledgeable and willing to try different regimens. Don’t expect a great deal of compassion. He is very blunt. Take him over any other doctor, he is truly one of a kind.Prepare questions. She will answer them, but as others have said, your time is limited. She will always answer questions though. I read these docs often do over 50 monitoring appointments from 7-9, for context. So she wouldn’t go into a monologue about my treatment plan, but always more than happy to explain my treatment plan.Please realize Doctors are human.  They can't give guaranteed results and they aren't perfect. Dr. Castelbaum loves what he does and it shows. If you want someone that will give you the brutal truth, yet deliver it in a compassionate way and someone who will truly fight for you Dr. Castelbaum is the guy to see.Trust in what he believes...his experience in this process speaks volumes.She will be direct and very scientific about what your chances are of conceiving.   Ask a lot of questions! He doesn't mind answering themIf you prescribe and recommend medication and supplements, give the patients a fair chance in allowing them to work.  Also, provide better communication methods if you are not available have another doctor call.  Do not leave hopeful patients waiting for over a week to get any answers. She is very thorough and knowledgeable.  She is a straightshooter and is very clinical in her assessments.  Some people not like or appreciate that, but I do.  Don't let them(the RMA Team) push you into purchasing medication right away so that you still have the option of getting out of there and finding another Doctor.  That FYI, you won't be dealing with just her, you get whichever Dr is in. Which isn't bad, they're all good. It would just be nice for continuity and questions.Understanding that she may be a bit conservative in her approach.Expect blunt information and insensitive jokes if you are sensitive . Do your research beforehand and have questions prepared. Question the statistics of treatments. I would strongly advise people to work with her, particularly if you are queer or trans!If you need hand holding find another doctor. If you go, you'll need to be a very strong advocate of your options.Be prepared to be told the absolute truth.  If you're somebody that needs any potentially tough information given ""sugar-coated,"" you may be surprised by Dr. Gutmann's blunt repsonses; just remember it comes from a caring and knowledgeable place.Don't be turned off by her brusque-ness! She's actually a really warm and caring person.Don't shy away from asking questions, even if you are bumping up against the limits of knowledge in the field of Reproductive Endocrinology. If he doesn't know the answer, he will tell you. He is a great doctor with a great deal of experience, but there are a lot of unknowns in this field, and being a well-educated patient is so important.Ask him anything he loves questions and he loves to hatch the plan with you. He doesn't tell you what ""his plan"" is for you instead it's your collaboration.Trying to understand that during the initial steps, Dr. Gutmann is very candid about the process and expectations of treatment. She will soften during the process. If you would to like to only see Dr. Gutmann, request appointments with Dr. Gutmann only when scheduling. Do your research beforehand and have questions prepared. Dr. Guttman is a highly trained and experienced physician. She would be a good fit for couples or individuals trying to conceive who are interested in simply receiving clinical care and who do not need additional support. Don't be afraid to take notes. You will have questions, and Dr. Gutmann will have a lot of answers and information...sometimes all at once, and it won't always be easy to remember everything that was said. That's ok. She's also open to your suggestions and will guide you...don't be afraid to advocate for yourself! In a best-case scenario, you'll feel an active part of the ""team"" at RMA. Don't hesitate to ask questions. They will get answered one way or another in her office. You're in good hands so relax:) Trust her. She is extremely thorough but if you have questions that are unanswered, ask! We thought Dr. Gutman was terrific, and she will always hold a special place in our hearts for bringing us to a place where we now have the family we desired. Along the way, we appreciated her no-nonsense, upfront explanations of the way things were, step by step, good or bad. That might not work for everyone.Don't expect someone who is touchy-feely.  Dr. Gutmann is matter-of-fact, but she will be honest with you, will always take the time needed to explain your treatment, and is excellent at what she does.Be a young patient with financial resources IVF is a long and sometimes confusing process, Doctor Freedman is at the top of his field. Trust the information he’s providing, but remember to ask plenty of questions. Be willing to do most of your interactions with the nurses at this practice. Come with lots of questions and don't be afraid to advocate for yourself.Ask questions if you do not understand. Dr. Castelbaum has patience and will go over anything you need so do not be scared to ask if you don’t know.He has been very affirming of LGBTQ+ identified patients and has a great sense of humor. If she got us pregnant, she can get you pregnant.If you want someone with the education and experience of a true fertility leader, she's your doc. She tells it like it is..never ambiguous, never harsh, but doesn't sugar coat either. She is so intelligent without making her patients seem dumb. Always has your best interest in mind and I'm pretty sure sheworks 23/7 Never be afraid to ask absolutely any questions! Do research before going in to the first appointment.  Have questions prepared. Be aware there is no guarantee and that they are providing the best care they can.  Ask as many questions as possible whenever feeling uncertain.  Start your infertility journey early and don’t mess around with IUI. Go straight to IVF, donor eggs, whatever.
I personally believe that if you cannot get pregnant naturally IUI is not enough to get you pregnant. Be more aggressive in pursuing pregnancy If you want someone who knows what they are doing and is honest and clinical then Dr. Gutmann is for you! You will not be disappointed.Ask questions and ask why she is doing thingsJust to be patient and to listen to him. He will lead you in the right direction.Believe in him. As scary as it is, he wants the best for you and to do everybody he can for you he successfulListen to your heart.  If you feel unheard go elsewhere.  But, RMA gave me my only miracle and I am forever gratefulAsk lots of questions, you'll find a wealth of information. Check test results before your insemination, too. Don't hesitate make an appointment TODAY!Ask questions, do your research, come win questions and be prepared to be the facilitator with any other doctors esp urologistsBe your own best advocate. Make sure you give all informationIf you need someone warm and empathetic she is not the right person.Stay positive. Ask questions. Ask questions and be open minded. Less time with other providers in the office. I wish she did the egg retrieval, I didn't care for that physician's personality and approach.Always have a list of questions prepared and bombard Dr. Gutmann with them whenever given the opportunity to see her. The way the practice is run, oftentimes patients see other doctors or only nurses, and they are not as well informed.Be very very direct with your questions and most important ask at every step how you are expected to feel. Also, ask what is the ""usual"" experience for a woman with a similar health profile. I was surprised by how I felt after egg retrieval and also how many embryos actually are mature, fertilize, and then grow! There is a drop off at every step and no one explained that to us! We will know better now if we have to do more rounds! Do not use if you have a history of miscarriages Relax and trust him Ask all the questions because he will answer every single one and explain them well.If you want the truth go see him
Trust him. Ask any question you have to put your mind at ease, but he will provide the best care.Don’t be afraid to ask questions, and do research online to ask more questions! The more you know the more comfortable you will feel.Take a breath, you’re in good, no great hands. I have recommended Dr. Castelbaum to many people.  I'm not sure exactly what piece of advice I would give but when I do recommend him, I always say the same thing... ""He's the best!  Don't waste your time anywhere else.""Be prepared with questions and come ready for every appt.Don’t worry you’re in good hands. Dr. Castelbaum’s optimism and confidence are contagious. It’s hard not to believe in him and the plan you agree on. She comes off as a no-nonsense, hands off kind of person, but she genuinely cares and treats each of of her patients and staff so well. She never makes you wait. I even left my headphones in her office and she brought them to
My IUI which was at KOP. She is very compassionate and understanding. Never be afraid to ask questions of Dr. C or of the nurses. They are happy to answer and you will feel more comfortable. They are all there to guide you through this process, and understanding what is going on and why helps a lot. There were many times when Dr. C supplied answers to questions I didn't even know to ask or before I could ask them. I would say to advocate for yourself if you feel like you are waiting and do not know the next steps.  That only happened to me once.  Make sure you are knowledgeable and on top of your treatment plan and goals so you don’t waste any cycles. Dr Freedman is very experienced and respectful of individualized treatment goals/plan but has many patients to manage so you must be your own advocate.Dr. C is a mix of kindness, quirky, and direct.  Don't be put off by his directness and appreciate the quirky.Tell him all of your concerns and ask him all your questions. He cares, he wants to make you feel at ease and he wants you to have all the information you need.Be “all in” when you go to see Dr. Castelbaum and follow his professional opinion and advice because he has mastered his job. Exhaust every avenue to make it happen because he will too!SEE HIM!!! Do not wait. Ask for Dr Castelbaum and trust him. He is such a caring, honest, and sweet gentleman who truly made my experience what it was.Just remember that you are one of many cases and patients he has seen. He's been through almost every situation, but you have not. Don't be shy to ask him to slow down or explain things further. It can be overwhelming, but remember that he is an expert. He genuinely loves his profession and wants to see you with a healthy baby and a happy future.He does like to joke around which he thinks helps patients relax more. I was fine with them and they did make me feel at easy since I was very nervous.  I think some people may not find this as comforting as I did. Relax and trust that Dr. Castelbaum will do everything he can to get you your healthy baby. Ask him as many questions as you need to. He always answered my questions and allowed me to feel supported and cared for. Be prepared to hear things in a blunt manner but accept that you’re being told the truth.  You have to trust your doctor He has a dry sense of humor, he is funny and is very genuine all at the same time. You will never be disappointed in any way! ",8.5,8.5,Well he moved on to surgical and high risk patients. Ask him anything he loves questions and he loves to hatch the plan with you. Be more aggressive in pursuing pregnancy If you want someone who knows what they are doing and is honest and clinical then Dr. Gutmann is for you!
65,RMA of Philadelphia,nurse,"She was so nice and understanding, she took her time with me with blood work as I hate needles. She would call me back quickly with any answers I needed when I called and leave a message with some one and what I want to ask or know. Overall she a genuine nice person I primarily interacted with two NPs in the clinic who were both outstanding. They were excellent communicators via phone and email- I would often get a response immediately if I emailed during the day. They were extremely helpful in guiding me with where to get the medications at the best prices, were always on top of prescribing what I needed well ahead of time, and helped me anticipate what I would need for each upcoming step. It was always a pleasure seeing them in the office and I felt that I could reach out to them for anything I needed.My nurse was very interested and seemed caring when it came to making sure t the paperwork was signed by me for the procedure. However, after that, I was bounced around from nurse to nurse which made the whole process seem to be very unorganized because I would have to explain myself over and over again to the new nurse. Landi made it super easy to get updates during my stimulation phase. She emailed me my status along with any medication changes.  She was always available to answer my questions and she was always so upbeat and welcoming during my appointments.  The day I went to get my beta test (I had already told her that I got a positive home pregnancy test), she ran out into the waiting room and gave me the biggest hug. When explaining the injections she rushed through the directions and when I asked her to repeat, she was quite rude and confused why I didn't get it. Very bad experience. Loved Kelly, I was excited everytime I saw her, extremely warm, compassionate, and professional, too.The information and test results i received were always available at the time that was communicated to me at my visit.  I received an explanation of all my levels and next course of action so that i was never left in the dark. Every time that i sent an email the nurse Ceil responded within the hour.All of the nurses were fantastic. They were knowledgeable, friendly and compassionate. You could palpate their passion throughout the clinic.Denise and Leanna were the main nurses that cared for me and I can genuinely say they were placed on this earth to do what they do. They are professional, compassionate, and personable. Truly the best people/nurses.The nursing staff has been fantastic.  If I had questions or concerns that they were not able to address immediately, I always got a follow up from them within a few hours. Melissa and Lindsay are top notch. If you call and they aren't available, you WILL get a call back on the same day. If you email, you WILL get a reply. They are super compassionate and are very invested in the care of their patients. Such sweet ladies!Melissa is the glue that holds the Mechanicsburg office together.  She is extremely knowledgeable, compassionate, and caring.  The nurse staff was awesome. They called with my results with 4-6 hours. They were able to answer any questions that may have had. They even made small talk and made jokes to keep my spirits up during trying visits. Melissa, Stephanie and the other staff at RMA Central PA (Landy, Jamie and new hire Kristy) are very professional and compassionate. Melissa is the only other staff member who will perform ultrasounds. She handles medication protocols and will go the extra mile to make sure you understand medication changes and administration. Steph is extremely organized, knowledgeable and a calm reassuring presence. They have helped me tremendously through two terminations, and are always improving customer care so that visits are efficient but I never leave without feeling that my needs and concerns have been met. It was good to have one point of contact for questions about the various injections, the drugs we needed, the timings, etc.  She provided us both with calendars to track our drug regimen and did demonstrations of the various products we needed to use.  We also were provided with comprehensive, well organized paperwork describing all the drugs and procedures in detail, so we knew what to expect and could reference them during treatment. Everyone was on time, focused on my protocol and comfort, as well as communicated in a timely fashion.Melissa is the person we saw most often and I cannot say enough about her intelligence, compassion, and care. She’s the best!Excellent nurses overall. Knowledgable and friendly. Very sensitive.I loved the personable nursing staff as much as I loved Dr. Freedman! After starting most of my days early in the morning in their office, I really appreciated how friendly and kind the nursing staff was.I loved the nursing staff! The main nurse I saw was amazing she showed me how to administer what I needed, she was awesome if I called and had a question, they just made a scary experience so comforting. All are amazing. Especially during this time of a pandemic Sometimes phone calls weren't well timed or communicated. Super friendly and gentle The staff was warm, friendly, and knowledgeable.She was knowledgeable, and could always find an answer for me if she didn't know right away. She was also kind and compassionate. The nurses were amazing.  Very friendly, informative, and reassuring.They were all AMAZING..SO caring, so sweet and so genuine. I felt like they were cheering me on every step of the wayI can’t even put into words how wonderful the nursing and admin staff at the Langhorne office are. They made a very emotional journey bearable. I dealt with Tina during both pregnancies. She was amazing, knowledgeable and really got to know me. She made
me feel comfortable.",8.5,8.5,"She was so nice and understanding, she took her time with me with blood work as I hate needles. She was knowledgeable, and could always find an answer for me if she didn't know right away."
66,RMA of Philadelphia,clinic,"Overall the nursing staff is pleasant to work with. There are a few nurses that I see more than others since I go to the same RMA location. They remember me and are professional and attentive. Always knew me and my situation and current status. Very compassionate to what we were going through as patients. I wish I could remember some of their names because they were fabulous. We have been pleased with RMA’s clinic and surgery center. Appointment times are generally on time. Location in King if Prussia is great for us and they have lots of other convenient locations in the area. I have not been with this clinic long but the nurses have been great at following up so far. The staff has been organized and they have done an excellent job in scheduling. The one thing that has so far not been a problem but I am aware of is that often times I get duplicate calls from the nursing staff regarding the same test results etcThey are just very good and are very supportive. They call when they are supposed to and email you if you don't pick up. RMA always treated my wife and me well. They're finance department will advocate for you to your insurance company on your behalf. The nursing staff made my wife feel at ease during her visits. The equipment and technology they use is astonishing. They're very responsive to phone calls and emails with questions.They need to learn to communicate a little better with appointments. They seem rushed at times. They were great getting you in the morning but I feel like I was always being dug at with the needle for blood work. It made me nervous. Every single nurse (of the 4-5 I saw regularly) was amazing with one exception. She was very nice, but seemed to want to reassure me rather than educate me, and in 1 case had a small miscommunication about where to phone in an updated prescription. She was fine, just a 4/5 instead of 5.These nurses cried with me during my losses, encouraged me to hold on to hope, and embraced me with my successes.  I can't say enough positive things about them.  No matter how many times I emailed or had questions, they always answered me as soon as possible and assured me I wasn't a bother and that this is what they were there for.  I felt cared for with them.All the nurses were extremely compassionate and helpful. They always called when they said they would. They relayed any information from the doctor and if I had questions, they would get the answer from the doctor and call back. They would call to remind me of medicines I needed to take and explained every step of the process. They made the process more bearable.Most nurses are great and feel for you. Some prefer to give you their advice instead of having the doctor call you about your concerns but if you ask to speak with the doctor they will do that. As with everything, make sure to stay on top of your treatment, ask questions and be clear about your steps because they will miss things and forget to tell you things. I just really didn't appreciate all the traveling that I had to do. I chose the location in Langhorne but had to travel to King of Prussia for any procedures. My boss was very supportive of my journey and allowed me to flex my schedule accordingly. However it was just added stress for me.The nursing staff was wonderful The were kind and respectful. Always called with the next step and explained it well. They were there for my husband when he fainted which he doesn’t like to talk about.I thought they were great and very understanding! Never been around a great group of peopleThe nurses were wonderful. You received a personal call after all labs and provided with the specifics - whether you understood what it meant or not - that was above and beyond. They were compassionate and friendly.Very compassionate always felt welcomed They were very niceVery organized and were able to communicate by email which helped since I can’t always call and talk on my phone during work.  Very quick to schedule appointments and answer calls.  Any time I had a concern I received a call back right away The nurses were very compassionate, professional and willing to help. They  called the same day with test results when applicable. If I sent an email via the secure portal, I always received an answer promptly. The RMA Nursing staff is amazing. They know their patients, listen, and really care. They are always available for questions and quick with responses.Strengths: small number of doctors at each practice location, so you see the same couple of doctors every time; monitoring ultrasounds are all performed by the physicians; continuity of care with both doctors and nurses; friendly and professional office staff; knowledgable financial coordinator

Weaknesses: weekend monitoring at a different office was less convenient for me than the weekday office location

I believe that the attentiveness of Dr. Schlaff and the other practitioners at the clinic made the all the difference in our successful outcome, especially since I went to his clinic years later than my prior clinic where I had multiple failed IUIs and IVF cycles.I was legitimately shocked at how well the nurses knew what was gong on, even if it was their first time meeting me. They were all funny and down to earth, which made the experience so much more managable. Every time they sent results, it felt as though they were experiencing the same emotions as you, whether it was excitement or disappointment. None of the emails they send were carbon copied - they were all completely individualized and answered very quickly. I think the only weakness would be that they sometimes assume that patients have a lot of prior knowledge, so when we had our first IUI, I was not sure exactly what all the terms and medications they were talking about. Now I understand them though.My only complaint is that there were a few times (twice maybe?) they forgot to call in my medication. This problem was easily rectified by calling the after hours service. The on call doctor would call my prescriptions in for me. Aside from that, the nursing team was my rock. They encouraged me, cheered me on, and always took the extra time to explain everything to me. They have been phenomenal.The nursing staff was the only good part of this experience with RMAFairly big team, so it should have felt impersonal but didn't. Supervising doc is always on top of the plan, and everyone made a personal connection.

Monitoring appointments in Center City were very convenient. Usually waited 5 minutes, with 1-2 exceptions. 8am seems to be busiest, so before or after is faster. Weekends in the Valley Forge local were an annoying haul, but worth it in the end.

Financially the jury's still out. My insurance had limited coverage for IVF, so they submitted various components of my testing and care separately. Some have been reimbursed and is still pending. RMA said they would bill us for anything not covered, up to the cost of their out-of-pocket plan ($14k excluding medication).

Overall I felt like I was in great, responsive, competent hands.The nursing staff at RMA is wonderful! Everyone knew me by name and made me feel so comfortable every time I went for an appointment. They were also always helpful with any questions or concerns I had.The nursing staff at RMA is wonderful, they are very kind and compassionate individuals and if I have any questions they respond back very quickly via phone or emailThe nursing staff was incredible.  They were all very knowledgeable about the entire process.  They returned phone calls and emails promptly and were always following up to ensure that you had all medications needed and thoroughly understood your next steps.  The team there works amazingly well together.  I am sad to leave and transition back to my OBGYN for monitoring. 
Before my appointment I was told I would need to fill out history in an electronic form. I never received this and had to call the office multiple times to receive this form. Other than that, I really did not have much interaction with the nursing staff. The nurses lost the bloodwork results I provided twice. They then tried to redo some of the blood tests. I had to come back the next day because they wouldn’t look at the results I previously provided while I was there. They didn’t return am important call on one occasion.  In general, I didn’t feel like they cared. The nurses always greeted me with such warmth and kindness.  My husband was undergoing cancer treatment while I was going through IVF-FET and they always made sure to check in to see how he was doing.  I loved everyone on the staff.There are a ton of nurses. I probably worked with at least 5 different nurses, all extremely warm and thorough. I was always surprised how patient and detailed they were with all my questions because I was admittedly high strung/anxious and had soooo many questions.The clinic is a reflection of those who work there.  If you read my full review of the Doctors and staff, you'll agree this clinic is fantastic.  I did have a few issues with billing, but that wasn't their fault.  My insurance is tricky and certain parts are carved out.  Even through those issues, the billing staff were cooperative and willing to work with me to get this all straightened out.As I saw this clinic for diagnostic, I didn't interact with the nurses very much nor was I in a position to be assigned a nurse.  I recall the first nurse who explained to me the blood tests that would be ordered was very kind and did a good job of explaining things. The strengths are the doctors and nursing staff. The weakness is the billing department. They incorrectly billed several times.  When I called to explain that they incorrectly billed, they weren't very pleasant to deal with.Most of the nurses were nice.  Jen though was only nice sometimes and not too personable.The Hematologist at RMA Center City are fantastic. Caring, let you know exactly what was going to happen step by step. The Hematologist at RMA King of Prussia are dry and seem not to be that interested in their patients.  Really like the nursing staff here, they're all sweet. In the beginning I had some confusion- I guess they're used to people coming in for multiple cycles and knowing the routine, but at first I didn't know what the steps were and not everything was fully explained. Once I got used to the basic routine, it was fine.There were two primary nurse practitioners who worked with me since I was using donors. They were both very responsive to my questions. The other nurses were also responsive to my questions. I felt confident in their knowledge. They were all very compassionate and also invested in the success of their patients. Nurses provided basic information but didn't offer helpful suggestions or further explanation. Really just felt as though they read from a script. The nursing staff was so supportive and seemed very up to date on our specific needs and situation each visit.They are very organized, follow the rules and try to have a good system in place. The rooms are always clean and waiting rooms are quiet. 
As a new patient, if you need hand holding see Dr. Freedman, he has great empathy and explains things well. If you want someone direct, data driven, and up to date on research see Dr. Castelbaum. Unfortunately, they work out of the other locations not center city.The nurses were all very efficient during appointments, which was appreciated when rushing to get bloodwork done in the morning before work!  The nurses remember the patients and are usually very warm.  When calling to talk to a nurse, they always respond quickly and have thorough answers.The RMA nurses in Center City are warm and inviting. They are good at every part of their job - from taking blood to showing compassion when you have a negative test. I love seeing the nurses when I arrive at the clinic. I was on a first-name basis with many of them after only a few appointments. I have felt less warmth from the nurses in King of Prussia, but that is not my normal clinic, so I don't feel like I can really speak to the atmosphere there.The RMA nurses are excellent and very communicative. They are also very compassionate and take the time to get to know you as a patient. They are quick to respond to email and phone calls. In any case, it is still important to take the time to keep yourself organized when it comes to your medication supply and dates for upcoming cycles, and notify them quickly if you notice any problems or discrepancies.From start to finish they were incredible with the loss and the BFP they were a great source of comfort and compassion I cannot say enough about the staff.Nurses were average. They didn't really provide any extra information and at times were even too sympathetic. By this I mean that they made us feel terrible coming in after our miscarriage because their demeanor was a little too ""sad"" rather than helping us to be optimistic (making sad faces, saying ""I'm so sorry"" repeatedly). The nursing staff at RMA of Philadelphia are the glue that holds the practice together. The nurses work very hard to answer your questions and address any concerns. Unfortunately, however, you are not assigned a primary nurse at this practice, so every phone call come be from a different person - often someone with no knowledge of your case and someone you have never met. This lack of continuity can be challenging as you relay your story and details over and over to new people. In our case, multiple clerical errors occurred, such as a blood test once being ""lost."" I don't blame the nurses, as I believe they are working very hard. But there is clearly a lack of cohesion at this practice that I believe would be improved by assigning patients to a single nurse or team who can keep track of details in a single place.The nurses at RMA are excellent! They respond to emails and phone calls in a timely manner, explain bloodwork results fully, and provide emotional support like no other medical practice. They literally and figuratively held my hand through every setback, and even came in early one Saturday morning to administer methotrexate so that I could spend the rest of that weekend regrouping and trying to stay positive after being diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy. I wouldn't have made it through treatment without their excellent support. I felt very comfortable and confident in this office's ability to get me pregnant.  I never felt stressed or rushed while I was at the office for my exams.  I had seen another doctor prior to this office and it was a huge difference on the good end of the spectrum.  I could not have been happier with Dr. Nguyen's office and this includes their staff in King of Prussia.  The doctors that did my egg retrieval and transfer were very nice with good bedside manners.  The one doctor had me laughing so hard after the retrieval.  I'll never forget the wonderful experience I had compared to the other clinic I had gone to. THe nurses were phenomenal. They really got to know me and were extremely supportive. They were all very friendly, professional, and sensitive. We always felt welcomed, warmly received, and like they were interested where we were on our journey. (Part of the reason we left the first clinic we tried was because of the nursing staff. Indifference and insensitivity come to mind in thinking about them.)RMA really knows what they're doing, and I never felt like I was a number.  Information was always relayed to me the same day from the nurses, and if I had any specific questions my doctor would respond to me directly via email as well.  All scheduling was always simple, and financing explained all the information for my insurance and then self pay options clearly.  I had brief experiences with nurses at this practice during blood work, ultrasounds, IUIs and calls with results. They were fine. The clinic has flexible scheduling and is great about getting you in when you need to get there. Even my consultation appointment was made earlier because they called with a cancellation. They usually run on time and are always quick to respond to questions.The nurse and office staff are ok but at times they can be rude and very unprofessional at times. They do not always provide the information you need and when you ask they make it seem as if you are getting on their nerves.RMA is always open...holidays and weekends. they are very responsive, helpful, and the staff is greatPretty knowledgeable and thoroughThe nursing staff was amazing as well. You spend a lot of time in the office when going through fertility and you build friendships with them. They always made me feel comfortable.It's a small office and I was seen super quickly and by my doctor- this I loved! 
But the receptionist was not pleasant or friendly to me at all  which made it a little awkward. They always took me on time though which was another plus  They were all very freindly. I could trust them. They began to feel like family.Hardworking, helpful, compsssionate. always smiling The nurses were friendly and good at drawing blood, but phone calls wereally not returned.Strengths: they are extremely organized, give timely call-backs, and are super-clean, and super friendly. June always said hi warmly when I arrived and remembered me offering comfort. As a single woman in this process, the warmth of the clinic substantially helped my sense of loneliness at being in this journey. The staff became my community I could count on for a smile everytime.
weaknesses: only thing on my last insemination, didn't give me thyroid blood tests back before the insemination.The clinic staff were inviting  and friendly. They knew my  name when i walked in and immediately checked  me in  with  ease.  I never waited more than 10 minutes to be seen. The clinic was clean and organized.The nurses were very kind, but they did seem to be managing a lotVery nice and good at their jobs. The nursing staff is lovely. They’re helpful and understanding. Lovely, supportive, attentive and empathetic.  They also are excellent at returning phone calls.Great great nursing staff! Everyone was compassionate and caring. They were right there every step of the way offering encouragement, etc. They were sad when I miscarried and treated me so kindly. They also cheered when I took a test and was pregnant. Poor scheduling. Not willing to work around your schedule. Will only seem patients between 7-10 am no matter the circumstances Always on time. Friendly and clean environment. Comfortable waiting area. I thought the clinic was greatTina was very nice and she was always very reassuring and showed a lot of patience It’s as simple as this, I cried at my last appointment. The clinic was always very busy but very well organized. One day I came in for an 8am appointment at 7am. They were able to squeeze me in like it was no problem at all. They always called promptly with my test results and answered all of my questions. They were more than flexible with appointment times and always there to answer my questions. They are all amazing, they remember you each time and are quick to respond on the
Portal so you don’t have to
Call each time you have a question The staff leaves all the patients feel very welcomed. They are willing to take time to answer any questions that you may have. They do not rush you out. They are very compassionate and understanding to what we are going through. Kind, responsive and rooting for the patients to have success!The nurses are who see prior to the doctor and they always were kind and efficient.  Any time I called with a question, the nursing staff would be quick with a reply after they consulted with my doctor (depending on the issue).I met a lot of nurses over the different offices I visited with RMA, and I found every one to be kind, attentive, great at their job, and compassionate. Clinic’s strength would be time management. I never had to wait to be seen. They schedule perfectly to have patients flow through seamlessly. They have early morning hours so that you do not have to miss work for frequent appointments. I also loved that you could be seen at any office. I was regularly a patient at Langhorne but upon accepting a new job I would be seen at Willow Grove location as well. Flexibility was extremely helpful with a work schedule.100% human and maternal. I felt like I was dealing with mothers and friends. Many of the nurses were new moms or expecting and truly felt connected to me. The clinic is very nice, large and clear.  They have everything at the Langhorne office, but you have to go to KOP and St. Mary's hospital for certain proceedures and tests.  Only thing that really bothered me is that you can't call your office directly, like ever, they just have an answering service and take messages. I think this clinic was great to work with. They were easy to make appointments and easy to reach someone on the phone to speak with. I always received a call back at the time I was told. And every time i called, everyone was very polite. The clinic starts you off with a visit with the doctor of your choice to discuss a potential treatment plan. They discuss any procedures or bloodwork you may need to get done to start the process. The clinic is made up of multiple offices so some doctors do travel between clinics. Therefore, you may not always get to meet with your specific doctor if you go in for bloodwork, ultrasounds, etc. If visits are not time sensitive, such as baseline, you can try to schedule with your specific doctor. You also have the option of scheduling appointments at different offices if you they are closer to you. The King of Prussia office is open 7 days a week. I live a distance away from my clinic so they work with me to get bloodwork done local to my house to try to help with travel. While you may not see your specific doctor, the other doctors are equally qualified and willing to help. My IUI procedures were done by a different doctor and I still felt as if I was treated as a person and they were still invested in my case. Strengths: RMA truly wants the best for their patients. They are experienced and make you feel like a human, not a number.  Weaknesses: They are busy, so if you don't have questions, they won't get into details.  If you are questioning anything or everything, don't be afraid to ask and don't feel bad about it. It is their job to explain what is going on.  One major downside to the clinic is the price.  They don't offer any bundled packages and they need everything up front. IVF is EXPENSIVE and usually takes more than one try- it all adds up very quickly.They have fantastic hours and multiple locations that all work together, so you can go to whichever one they have an appointment at. The one thing to be prepared for is that the nursing and patient services staff have absolutely nothing to do with finances or insurance. They don't know how much medications will be, they don't know what your insurance company will cover - that is completely handled by the finance department, so they will often suggest procedures to you without mentioning the price. 

The staff is amazing otherwise and the clinic is clean and welcoming. It might be a while to get an initial consult but it is worth it!It’s very difficult to get in touch with the person you’re looking to talk to. You can’t call directly through to an office - you speak to someone who puts a message in to your office and then they call you back when they can. This isn’t convenient for my line of work because I can’t talk at certain times throughout the day. I can't say enough good things about RMA.  Because of my work schedule I am in different parts of the metro area every day,  and have been able to schedule treatments and appointments different offices (Philly, Willow Grove, and KOP) to fit my needs.  Despite my jumping around, every doctor and nurse I've seen has had full knowledge of my file and treatment plan, and my primary Dr. has always followed up with me directly. The nurses are the only strength for this facility.  The nurses showed that they cared about you unlike the doctor. There was a lack of communication within the call center and the doctor was just lazy. RMA has knowledgeable, friendly medical professionals working there. They make you feel comfortable every time your there.  They never rush you and spend as much time as needed to answer any questions.  They always get back to you in a timely manner. Strengths are communication and compassion by each individual, weakness would be the distance because I travel 100 miles and price because they are more expensive than other clinics I have looked at or went to.All of the staff at RMA is warm, friendly, and thorough.  Even the financial coordinator was amazing and helped me through some very difficult insurance changes that occurred at the beginning of the year in the middle of my treatments.  There was an occasional time or two where my monitoring was completed by another Dr. and they were all very friendly and knowledgeable.  Everything was very organized and clean on each visit.  The waiting room was always full when I arrived, but your wait times were minimal.  This office does run like a well oiled machine.   RMA is a large clinic with multiple sites so they have a lot of the kinks worked out. It also did not take that long to get in to see Dr. Gutman. 



Her demeanor is not warm and fuzzy but she did give us a good second opinion. I mentioned during my appointment that I had spoken with a clinical coordinator and was told I would be eligible to do a clinical trial for IVF. She told me I would not be eligible and her dismissal of it was a little brusk. 

As for the second opinion she told us what she would do differently in our IVF treatment. Specifically, she would start me on a higher dose or follistim and would add Menopur. Additionally, because I have had one chemical pregnancy in the past she suggested doing a hysteroscopy and possibly an ERA biopsy. She also stated that my partner and I should definitely do PGS testing with our next cycle. 

I did not get the warmest feeling from
her but do feel as though she gave us a sound, honest opinion. 
It felt like a factory- being moved through. The staff often seemed annoyed. They lost test results and did not provide results from a test they performed despite three requests. I’m not sure if the issue was just being disorganized or the personalities of the staff, but we had issues on so many occasions, we moved on to another clinic. The atmosphere was not warm or inviting. I don't see any weaknesses.  It is an exemplary clinic and others should take note of how well it is run not only with efficiency but compassion and kindness as well.  I would recommend RMA King of Prussia to anyone seeking ART.Awesome practice. I worked with many different docs here. Sort of like the 3 little bears, some of these docs were too optimistic, some too dry, but Dr. Gutman was the perfect balance for me. She never offered false hope or vague statements the other doctors sometimes made, like “it is what it is” or “we don’t know yet so we’re just going to assume it will all work out.” Instead, she’d joke with us, empathize with our losses, but report only in terms of science, e.g. baby is x% of growth margin or whatever. This was perfect for us...we wanted the facts, and her warmth made the delivery of these more tolerable. Mostly strengths with this clinic....i have never really had an issue that wasn't addressed immediately.
They communicate well and make you feel important. 
The only major weakness is that all surgical and transfer procedures are done in King of Prussia, almost 2 hours away.Again, I did not receive any intervention through this clinic.  You were able to do lab work through the clinic which was convenient. They told me someone would call to talk about finances, which was followed through on.  I never had to wait long.          Communication is not the greatest of strengths which I think is needed when dealing with patients who are going through such a difficult time.  The ones who drew blood were nice but I feel that only 1 out of the 5-6 I saw actually knew how to do it without being painful...the rest hurt quite bad each time.  the nurse staff with the doctors were pleasant.  the call backs were always inconsistent and the information provided sometimes were thorough and sometimes was not.  ifeel that they should provide you with the same numbers each time and then when you are on another round, they should give you your previous to compare to versus us trying to keep track of it all.  I like that the location I go to is small.  I see either the nurse practitioner or doctor every visit.  Monitoring on weekends is convenient, I'm lucky to live 10 minutes from the office and hospital (where weekend monitoring appointments are).  For major procedures like egg retrieval, FET, etc we had to travel to the King of Prussia office but other than that all procedures were done locally.  I like it, but I wish the same Dr were available at the location each time I went (more or less). They rotate locations though so I saw the 2 other drs more than my primary. Staff is nice and helpful. They seem to understand that fertility is a stressful/touchy subject so they make the visits nice. Waiting room is nice. Clinic is clean. I've brought my 4 year old daughter to most visits with me and they always welcome her and give her stickers.Their physicians and staff are their biggest strengths. The multiple locations are another strength. The facilities are well designed and comfortable. Their surgery center is extremely well run.
Weaknesses- I can't think of any. We really felt like a number there. This is something we've realized more as time goes on, especially with our current RE who is so specific and personal. A strength would be that overall,RMA is very successful. However, this is only true if you have an easily fixable issue. Friends have gotten pregnant there within only a few cycles. But with us, they seemed content to just ""go through the motions,"" and when the typical methods didn't work, they went right to IVF as though it was no big deal. Everything seemed ""scripted"" in a way, without really trying to look for an issue and individualize our care. Highly queer competent, they do a lot of outreach in the community. We saw all the doctors in the practice at different times over the year we worked with RMA, and though Dr. Gutmann was in charge of our care and was our point of contact, we didn't have a problem with any of the other doctors on staff. Overall, RMA does a great job of being extremely clear in all forms of communication, and they are great about letting you know exactly what is happening and what will happen next.This clinic is clearly very skilled in reproductive medicine; I describe them as a ""well-oiled machine.""  Almost all staff were warm and caring, while being very thorough.  Another big strength and appeal for us was their inclusivity of the LGBT community.  Some weaknesses would be that every now and then, another doctor would do the vaginal ultrasounds, and they weren't as warm as Dr. Gutmann.  Also, we did have a frustrating conversation with a financial planner when we made the decision to go from IUI to IVF.  She didn't know our situation and actually was almost pressuring us to go with an anonymous donor over our known donor due to cost.RMA is a fantastic clinic. All the doctors are knowledgeable and friendly. The space is clean and warm. The connection to Jefferson Hospital makes procedures like the hysterosalpingogram easy. The one big downer to RMA is that the only clinic open on Sundays is in King of Prussia, so if you need to see a doctor on Sunday you must travel to the suburbs. It's highly inconvenient if you do not have a car. RMA as a clinic is excellent. They are open every single day of the year, so you never have to worry about cycle timing due to the clinic being closed. Their surgery center is also very comfortable and easy to access, given that it is attached to their KOP office and shares much of the same staff. The nurses and other staff in the surgery center are great. The doctors rotate, so you may not see the same doctor during each visit, but I do not mind this feature because it allows the clinic to be open every day.It is bright and welcoming they have separate locations for consultations  and where they tell you about billing so it is not all clinical. The rooms are warm and bright and the whole place is very clean. They have artist pictures on the wall a lot having to do with fertility that you can purchase if you like it.The clinic's strength is its desire health those who cannot procreate have a child. They are warm and welcoming. They, also, clear if they cannot help you. Once Dr. Gutmann could help me any further with my disease, she referred me to someone else. We really felt like a number there. This is something we've realized more as time goes on, especially with our current RE who is so specific and personal. A strength would be that overall,RMA is very successful. However, this is only true if you have an easily fixable issue. Friends have gotten pregnant there within only a few cycles. But with us, they seemed to just ""go through the motions,"" and when the typical methods didn't work, they went right to IVF as though it was no big deal. Everything seemed ""scripted"" in a way, without really trying to look for an issue and individualize our care. The strengths of RMA of Philadelphia include multiple locations across the Philadelphia area, weekend hours at their King of Prussia location, and a strong and devoted nursing staff. Weaknesses include not seeing your physician regularly, seeing sonographers for monitoring appointments, and not having an assigned nurse to oversee your care. Treatment at RMA is flexible and individualized. They open early at 7 am each morning for monitoring, and will readily call back even if you try to get in touch after hours or on weekends. They're open 365 days per year and will work with you to design treatment plans that cater to your specific situation. Strengths- small, well managed, concerned about the level of patient care and taking steps to improve patient education over the year and a half I have been there. 
Weaknesses- have to travel for Egg retrieval and Embryo transfer procedures (although not exceedingly far, but turnpike closed for first Embryo transfer and had to fill my bladder twice! 120oz's over the course of 2hrs!). Sometimes miscommunications happen in the Pinnaclehealth system when testing needs to be done on weekends at Harrisburg hospital, or at outpatient testing clinic in the Fredrickson building during weekday monitoring. Communications seems to have also improved since I first started with Dr. Nguyen, and was not really the fault of RMA. Everythign was very easy. I was seen on time, received lab results on time and making appts was easy. I would have preferred to have spoken to only nurses that I saw in my regular office rather than nurses from other offices which happened from time to time. I was concerned that they werent as familiar with the ins and outs of my treatment and didn't always feel as comfortable. We love that that clinic is inclusive and helps same-sex families achieve the families they desire. Location was a big plus for us with RMA--two of the offices were convenient for us when it came to blood draws, etc. Having the acupuncturist on-site was convenient as well. The facility was clean and always spotless. The staff gave very good, clear instruction about how to administer the medications and shots. They were also very helpful with suggesting rebate programs, etc., for the expensive medications. One dark spot in all the wonderfulness we experienced with Dr. Gutman and RMA came from the billing director out of the Willow Grove office. When our IVF cycle was canceled because there weren't any eggs to retrieve, the refund process was explained to us by the woman who handed billing in King of Prussia (she was wonderful). When it came time to enact the refund, her supervisor (that would be the woman in Willow Grove) got involved and was very abrupt and unfriendly with us, seemingly because either we misunderstood how we would be refunded, or because the woman in King of Prussia explained it to us incorrectly. We've always wondered if the King of Prussia woman got into trouble for either offering to give us a refund in a way that wasn't allowed, or for misleading us.Strengths are organization and scheduling.  Fertility treatment requires a huge amount of coordination of appointments, drugs, testing, and procedures.  RMA, the clinic, was very organized and on top of  our treatment plan.  They also had appointments at convenient times and I never waited more than 15 minutes for a scheduled appointment.  A weakness, if you can call it that, is that you will not see the same doctor every time you go in.  This would be impossible, given that your appointments are based on your cycle and treatment milestones, so unless your doctor worked 7 days a week, it would be impossible to see him or her every time you went in.  They are organized, however, so whatever doctor you see will know what you need at a particular visit.  The only (unavoidable) downside is that we loved the doctor who oversaw our treatment, and who saw us most of the time, but didn't always connect with the other doctors who we only saw occasionally.No negative comments I like that this office has early monitoring appointments starting at 7:00am. I was given Dr. Freedman's card with his email, which he responded to promptly. I almost exclusively interacted with the nursing staff which was mostly fine, but I wish there was more debriefing after unsuccessful cycles and involvement in the ""game plan."" After experiencing a miscarriage, I was never contacted by the clinic and they didn't follow my beta hcg down to zero. This clinic do not offer a patient portal so you have to go to the office for everything. There are several offices for your convenience. You can choose any office that works for you. The office staff can sometimes be rude if you go on a busy day and they show little concern once you become a patient but not active at the time. It seems they are only concerned with active or potential patients.We live in Central PA - so it’s nice having the clinic so close. It was slightly inconvenient that any surgical procedures, as well as anything on the weekend, needs to be done at the King of Prussia office - but it could be worse!Clinic has hours everyday and on holidays. Very responsive to phone calls. Staff helps to look into insurance issues, which was very helpful. Early office hours allow for appointments before work. You have one primary doctor, but you will see multiple doctors based on who is scheduled. Ultimately, your doctors make all of the decisions. Our doctor was even making decisions and communicating decisions with us when she was on vacation abroad. They can see you very early in the morning, and on the weekends. They also get you in and out as quickly as possible! The weekend office and surgical office is in King of Prussia, which is far for some, but a good excuse to shop afterwards. The clinic was prompt with any questions or anything we needed.  The clinic was clean, easily accessible, and timely.  Efficient, accessible, comfortable. 200 words? Really?
Parking was good. Business staff helpful. Place is clean, modern equipment. Short wait time for appointment booking. Short time in waiting room. Good magazine selection Clinic is great! It’s warm. Staff is amazingly compassionate. They are understanding and positive. They know your name and face. They answer questions and concerns. They go above and beyond to make sure you have what you need. The drs & staff were wonderful from beginning to end. They never made you feel like a number and always made you feel at home. I would recommend this office to anyone. I was definitely satisfied with my experience.Great communication. Everyone worked together as a team and treated my husband and I with the highest regard. They supported us and showed empathy. They were sensitive to our needs and situation.  They were always positive and full of energy, especially in early mornings!Clean, many locations, quick service, team approach, quiet. The staff are always available for questions and helpful in going over billing and procedures if need. The staff can make you smile even after the worst news and work with you over outrageous outstanding bills Strengths: doctors have years of experience and dedication.
Weaknesses: lack of communication. 
RMA is dedicated and committed to helping families with their infertility goals; however I believe they lack in their understanding of the devastating of secondary issues.Be prepared to wait for your appointment at the clinic. Come prepared with questions and know your insurance protocols beforehand. Never feel like your question may be too minor, bc they deal with this every day!Very on top of patient relationship and quick. Get you and in and out. Flexible on appt times or lateness. Good on explaining things and keeping you updated on what is going on. I didn’t mind getting my blood drawn because they were good. This specific clinic is great. They have multiple locations which is convenient. There are multiple doctors as well. So far I really like it. I’m happy with how things are going and I highly recommend them. Very efficiently run.  Front desk staff is great.Great clinic. Ran smoothly. No issues with any dept. All offices were welcoming! All depts were a plus to work with. Nurses/front desk employees were nice and helpful. Loved going to the different offices. Strengths are availability- it was great to go before work and be in and out. No cons but maybe to be closer to where I moved now! Parking was easy and a ton of locations. Hours were great and they literally were open all the time. You never know when you’re going to ovulate!The office is very small and outdated. I also wish I could have stayed local for the egg retrieval rather than drive 2 hours away for a procedure.This office is very organized and thorough. They are very on top of getting back to you with results and responding to any questions. They answer the phones quickly and respond promptly to emails. I have never felt I have waited too long for a response. The receptionists were very friendly and knew my name and we became friends throughout my visits. I wish the office was a little closer to my house. They are close to the mall so sometimes I went shopping after my visit You won’t regret this beautiful, personal experience. I’ve got to be honest, my husband sought out the practice, I wanted nothing to do with it. As time went on and I started sharing with friends and colleagues that we hadn’t become pregnant yet, four different (unrelated) people/couples recommended RMA! Now if that doesn’t say something, what does?! Excellent clinic overall. Try to request your same Dr if possible every visit. It may mean traveling. However, the other doctors I saw for monitoring were very good. But I still liked the continuity of having my Dr each time.You have to go a lot and if you drive, there’s a parking garage that can be validated. They may be moving soon so keep an eye out. The current office is hard to find in the building so ask for specific directions.The only weakness is that it would have been helpful to have contact info (like email) spelled out clearly for a brand new patient. I wasn't sure when it was okay to email, when it wasn't (turned out, it pretty much always was). But otherwise, I saw three different doctors - Dr. Castelbaum most of the time for my appointments, though twice another doc, and then Dr. Gutman did both my mock transfer and actual transfer, since it's whoever is on duty when your body is ready to go. All were really great - Dr. C with information and helping guide our decision making process, Dr. G with calming down and reassuring a very very nervous patient at mock and real transfer!They always returned my messages that were left if they were unable to find a nurse at that time to answer my question.  I also always got my blood results same day, which alleviates a lot of stress from waiting.Preferred RMA to another large academic fertility clinic in Philly that I went to first. Felt like a person here, not just a number. Primarily went to Center City office. Annoying that on the weekend you have to go out to KOP to have stuff done. Liked all doctors, nurses and office staff.All the doctors I have interacted with over the past five years have been knowledgeable, science driven, and compassionate.  Of the two offices I used for appointments, both were mediocre with wait times for both blood work and ultrasounds because most women who want to fit in their appointment before work are all being ""seen"" at 7am...which is impossible. The strength of the clinic is their flexibility to be open so early in the morning, especially if you work full time. It is possible to go through this process with a full time job, even if it gets pretty tough. 

The weakness is a couple of the front desk employees. Most are fantastic, but there are a couple who are very rude and insensitive. My bad experiences weren't really enough to overshadow the excellent care I received from the doctors and nurses, but I will say that the compassion of everyone who works there is critical, including the front desk staff. An IUI is not a fun procedure to need, and these treatments and appts become very stressful. To have someone be impatient with you or insensitive at such a delicate time can be enough to want to give up.I have no weaknesses to report . I loved every thing from scheduling, to calling with questions and how I was handled during my entire experience. The nursing staff was prompt and settled my anxious nerves very quickly. Dr Castelbaum was reassuring and professional during my stay  and I trusted him implicitly. The Langhorne office was small, and the lab area was in the hallway. I felt this was a little too open. Towards the end of my care, they moved to another office, and that was perfect. The new location is great. What I didn't love was having to travel to KOP for weekends and procedures, but I knew that going in. I really liked the Langhorne staff, so going to KOP was an adjustment. Positive, comforting and knowledgeable are just a few words to describe Dr. Castelbaum and his staff. I always felt taken care of and informed at each visit. He and the staff explain step by step and walk you through each part of the treatment, procedures and ultrasounds. Try to get to the clinic as early as possibly, if you are going for bloodwork or treatment before work. Don’t be afraid to ask your doctor any questions you may have. Definitely research your options so your fully aware of your treatment and choices.Early morning monitoring appointments were hit or miss. Some days I would be in and out very quickly, other days I would be there for almost an hour.  I would say they were usually on the quicker side for the most part, however there were still a handful of times that took way longer than needed.  The days that did take long however, once I got into the monitoring room, I did not feel rushed out.It was very smooth, they take patients for sonograms on a first come, first serve basis.  Bloodwork can take a bit more time since it is done in the outpatient lab but is not usually too long of a wait.  RMA patients are expedited in the outpatient center.  Monitoring innthe mornings was well-run. Rarely would I wait more than 15 minutes, and rarely were patients overscheduled, but if I required and early-morning appointment they were always able to squeeze me in during a convenient time. The clinic strikes a great balance between giving patients their time and making sure everyone is seen. ",8.5,8.5,"Overall the nursing staff is pleasant to work with. I recall the first nurse who explained to me the blood tests that would be ordered was very kind and did a good job of explaining things. The RMA nurses in Center City are warm and inviting. I felt very comfortable and confident in this office's ability to get me pregnant. Kind, responsive and rooting for the patients to have success!The nurses are who see prior to the doctor and they always were kind and efficient. Any time I called with a question, the nursing staff would be quick with a reply after they consulted with my doctor (depending on the issue).I met a lot of nurses over the different offices I visited with RMA, and I found every one to be kind, attentive, great at their job, and compassionate. My IUI procedures were done by a different doctor and I still felt as if I was treated as a person and they were still invested in my case. They don't offer any bundled packages and they need everything up front. I was seen on time, received lab results on time and making appts was easy. RMA, the clinic, was very organized and on top of  our treatment plan."
67,RMA of Philadelphia,protocol,"1. First semen analysis showed slightly low sperm count and motility. She recommended supplements. My husband also decided to cut from ~3-6 beers a week to 1. Three mos later Dr. Gutmann said test results had rebounded so well that she thought one of the tests was inaccurate, and the answer was most likely somewhere in between.

2. We weren't ready to fully dive into IVF yet so our first step was a Clomid + timed intercourse cycle. 1 ultrasound monitoring appt showed 5 eggs. Negative test.

3. Dr. Gutmann informed us of a research opportunity that would pay for the entire IVF cycle except medication. This sort of kick-started our commitment, but I got busy for 2 months and put off the diagnostic tests. Study was closed to my age bracket by then but we decided to go ahead anyway.

4. IVF cycle with injectables. Started at 400iu Follistim, but as my estrogen levels climbed sky high they switched me to daily monitoring & bloodwork, and tweaked dosage every day. Inconvenient, but great care. On trigger day I screwed up a medication pickup and did not have the prescribed trigger med at home. The doctor on call was great about prescribing an alternative w that I could do within the hour. He explained this alternative would put me at higher risk for OHSS, but they would monitor me closely.I started on 300 IUs of Follistim and low dose hcg.  This was decreased around day 3.  Ganirelix was added in on day 5.  I triggered on day 10 with Lupron and a higher dose of hcg. I did clomid on it's own 3 times first days 3-7 which resulted in failed cycles. Then for our IUI, we were on 75 of Gonal F, 100mg clomid and did the trigger shot. We went in every other day for monitoring We did 3 cycles of IUI and they were not successful for me. Then he did an HSG. Around that time my family relocated to another state so we were not able to continue seeing himSince we are an LGBT couple with no known fertility issues, Dr. Lange recommended starting with IUI using a sperm donor. I did 2 medicated cycles using Letrozole and Ovidrel as a trigger shot. The first round was unsuccessful. The second round resulted in an ectopic pregnancy. We will be moving towards IVF due to the concerns of a higher chance of another ectopic pregnancy. I have been through 2 IVF cycles with Dr. Gutman. The first cycle we used BC for a week prior to starting stims.  We then followed the agonist protocol with an aggressive med list.  We did 300 follistim iu and 75iu menopur for twelve nights.  About a week into stims, we realized I wasn't responding to the meds as we would expect for someone my age. I was producing fewer eggs than normal. The word ""cancel"" was tossed around once or twice, however we went through with the retrieval.  8 follicles were retrieved, 6 were mature, 4 fertilized and made it to day 5, however only 1 was able to transferred. That round ended in a negative beta.  We took a month off, and then started another round of stims. This time instead of BC, we primed with estrogen ( we thought the BC may have suppressed me too much).  We then did the same agonist protocol with the same dosages.  We stimmed another twelve nights and all monitoring appointments showed more follicles than the first round.  However, retrieval yielded only 7 follicles, and none fertilized. We haven't done another IVF cycle since then. We have done 4 IUI's with follistim and follistim/clomid. The first IUI resulted in a chemical pregnancy. The other three ended in negative betas. Each IUI showed at least 3 mature follicles.After our initial consult, she scheduled me for an MRI of the pituitary, which showed a small tumor, meaning that I would very likely not respond to oral medications and advised we go straight to injectables. I began 75iu of Menopur for three days, then after my blood and ultrasound, continued for three more days. I was then bumped up to 150 iu after my estrogen was still &lt;100. I had bloods and ultrasound every 3 days throughout the entire process. I triggered with Ovidrel after day 14 of Menopur and my IUI was performed 32 hours later. I received my period prior to the pregnancy test. 

Our second IUI followed the same protocol, with 16 days of stims before trigger. This time, she started me at 75IU, but shortly bumped me back up to 150iu, as my estogren dropped after the first three injections. The second IUI resulted in a positive HCG test, but the level was 34 and quickly dropped to 6. I got my period shortly after. 

Our next IUI baseline is scheduled for this week and will likely follow the same protocol. I was put on the antagonist protocol. He never explained the logic for this protocol. This yielded 14 eggs and resulted in 10 frozen embryos. We transferred 1 embryo each time. First transfer resulted in a negative test and the second resulted in a miscarriage.When I first went in, Dr. Guttman immediately suggested a medicated cycle with IUI.  I wasn't mentally prepared to start treatment right away, so she suggested trying Ovasitol and prescribed a thyroid medication.  Over the next few months, RMA checked in on me periodically and Dr. Guttman continued to monitor my thyroid levels and adjust my medication accordingly.

Once my husband and I were ready to begin treatment, his sperm was tested and I went in for baseline monitoring and an HSG.  I was prescribed Clomid, and once my follicles were the appropriate size, Ovidrel.  I had an IUI 36 hours later.

I got pregnant on the first try, but unfortunately miscarried at 7 weeks and subsequently had a D&C.  I am currently waiting for my HCG levels to return to 0.  Once my period returns (and assuming ""elective procedures"" are possible given COVID-19), I'll be undergoing a hysteroscopy to help determine our next steps.Nothing but un-monitored cycles. Does not want to change any dosage for medication and does not respect your wishes when you want to have a monitored cycle.I did two cycles of IVF. The first cycle I used Gonal-F, Meopur & cetrotide. My ovaries did not respond well to the medications and they only retrieved 4 eggs resulting in one embryo which did not work. Dr Castelbaum expressed his concerns but said we could try a more aggressive protocol and added in micro Lupron.  I responded much better with the added medication.  This time they got 19 eggs and I ended with 3 embryos. We transferred one embryo, which resulted in a miscarriage, and froze the rest. The first frozen transfer worked and I had a daughter. I just had my second frozen transfer which always worked!Unfortunately I don’t have results yet because I am getting ready for another transfer which I discussed earlier the different protocols she is currently using in my care. My first cycle began with Clomid and Ovedril leading to my IUI.  My second cycle we used Letrozole to regulate my ovulation and Ovedril prior to the IUI.  Throughout both cycles there was constant blood work and ultrasound monitoring to track my ovulation.  Having one failed IVF cycle Dr. Gutman stated that If I did more IVF treatment cycles she would add Menopur in addition to Follistim.

Also, having had one chemical pregnancy she suggested doing a hysteroscopy and ERA testing. He prescribed clomid but had me start on day 6, which another doctor confirmed didn’t do anything. I had terrible side effects (tingling in limbs and panic attacks) and they did nothing to help me or advise me after I called reporting the side effects. We did a fairly aggressive antagonist protocol with Gonal-F and Menopur then Cetrotide.  I responded extremely well to the protocol.  At retrieval I had 25 eggs, with 23 being mature.  16 fertilized with ICSI and 8 embryos made it to day 5 for PGS biopsy and freezing.  I did not respond well to the oral/vaginal estrogen, so we performed a mini-stim protocol for the FET.  I did 10 days of follistim 75IU injections, with PIO starting a few days before transfer.  Unfortunately the transfer resulted in a negative pregnancy test.  I am hoping to generate more embryos before prepping for a new FET.First 9 weeks was just monitoring because, against all odds, my first appt revealed my first natural pregnancy. We lost this baby and Dr. G was great, and suggested a slightly more aggressive approach of letrizol, progesterone, trigger shot, and IUI which we did. I ended up bleeding and having low hcg levels, which made me very anxious and I asked to terminate the pregnancy rather than finish what I thought was a miscarriage. From there, doc monitored me for 9 weeks, even answering my questions by phone immediately before the holidays. At week 9 Dr. G graduated me because against the odds, this pregnancy looks viable. Nurse still did follow up after final appt. it was a great process- wish I could stay w dr. G a couple more weeks because of my anxiety, but I understand that a reproductive specialist has to draw a clear line of time to move on to OB.My protocol was metformin and estrace daily. We added gonal-f and menopur with a lupron trigger. At age 39, we retrieved 35 eggs, 30 were mature. I ended up with 6 5AA embryos, sent for PGS. After PGS we had 3 normal males and 2 mosaic males.  We got pregnant on the first transfer of a 5AA PGS normal male.I saw Dr. Gutmann for diagnostic workup. VERY high dose shots of Gonal F/Follostim with Menopur and then a trigger shot (cetrocide).  We started with clomid and timed intercourse.  I did not like clomid and the side effects that occurred with it and we quickly moved on to injectable meds with timed intercourse.  She was very candid about her treatment plan and why she recommended moving on to IVF when she did.  I started out the first cycle without drugs because I got pregnant easily the first time. Second cycle I used Letrosol because there is supposedly a slightly lower risk of multiples than Clomid. Didn't like the side effects of Letrosol. Next 3 cycles with Clomid and Ovedril. 5 cycles total of IUI. About to start trying with IVF.She had me undergo a hysteroscopy prior to beginning the cycle. A fibroid was found and surgery was advisedly. On repeat scope, another possible fibroid was found which wasn't clear and so an MRI was recommended and showed that there were two small fibroids which wouldn't interfere in pregnancy given their location. Even though this delayed the cycle it gave me the beatbox chance of having success and peace of mind. I did become pregnant with that first cycle Castlebaum basically told us to request what we wanted if we weren't going to do IVF. He did not think outside the box or offer alternate options. We tried 3 IUIs with progesterone as this had worked (though resulted in miscarriage) with our 4th IUI. On the final IUI ,I asked if there was anything else and he said we could perhaps try Follistim (no real explanation why). We also added Ovidrel, and he told us it was up to us which day we used it rather than monitoring and figuring out the most optimal time. All 3 IUIs resulted in negative tests.We used Letrozole to regularize ovulation, plus bloodwork and ultrasound monitoring to track the process of ovulation. Then, when the follicles looked good, we would use an HCG trigger shot to trigger ovulation, followed by an IUI. After the IUI we used progesterone suppositories.We are still in process with Dr. Gutmann and needed to have a change of course, so I don't have current specifics.Dr. Gutman first worked with me to identify if I could ovulate normally on fertility drugs since my PCOS kept me from ovulating normally naturally. She proscribed me Letrozole (after explaining the risks, giving me literature about the risks, and having me sign a consent form​ for the drug). I took two 5mg tablets (I think) of Letrozole on cycle days 4-9. After coming in for monitoring it was clear that I responded well to the Letrozole, so we started IUI cycles thereafter. I've been through 4 IUI cycles so far. I start with Letrozole, I'm monitored throughout the cycle, I take a trigger shot of Ovidrel when I have mature follicles and come in for insemination ~36 hours later. After 3 unsuccessful cycles I had a consultation with Dr. Gutman where we went over my body's responses to each cycle according to the monitoring. After reviewing each cycle she gave me multiple options for moving ahead which included more expensive and less expensive options - at no point did I feel pushed toward one option over another. I decided to continue with the Letrozole IUI cycles for the time being. We're still trying at the moment.My first protocol was a typical antagonist protocol. It went worse than expected, given my age and other lab test results, but still yielded mature eggs that fertilized with ICSI. We decided to have another egg retrieval in order to bank more embryos prior to doing a transfer. Dr. Castelbaum recommended a micro flare protocol, which unfortunately yielded no mature eggs. We are trying again with another antagonist protocol.Iui twice with me using letrezol and hcg trigger shot one was positive pregnancy that ended in mc the other did not work. With my wife he did two iui no med assist and the first did not work the second did! After receiving my history from my previous doctors, Dr. Gutmann performed an ultrasound and HSG to decide which route to take, medication or injectionables. My disease had not progressed, therefore, I started with Clomid. Unfortunately, I developed Ovarian Hypersensitivity, and wasn't able to continue with the Clomid. We allowed my system to calm down for awhile. After an MRI, Dr. Gutmann noticed my disease had began to progress very rapidly, and we decided the best course of action was surgical intervention.  After the post-surgical/pre-fertility treatment MRI, my disease had progressed further, and I was referred to an oncologist. Dr. Gutman was apart of my team through my crisis. We began with Clomid only for a cycle. With the 2nd cycle, IUI was proposed by a nurse over the phone without any explanation or prior conversation. This was alarming since this was our first RE and we had no idea what to expect. We did Letrozole only for the next cycle, then 4 IUIs with Letrozole. On the last IUI, Dr. Freedman added progesterone (without any explanation, but again we didn't know any better amd just went with it). We got pregnant with this last IUI, but miscarried at 7 weeks with an empty gestational sac. I had a D&C, then once my levels returned to normal, we decided to take a break from ttc. Eventually, we decided to go with a new RE who might be more aggressive. We did Clomid + IUI cylcles with Dr. Gutmann and one Clomid alone cycle. Neither the dosage was ever changed nor was the protocol. Our result was multiple miscarriages and we ultimately switched practices and doctors after searching for a second opinion.For my IUI cycles, I took 5 mg of Femara on days 4-8 and was monitored via bloodwork and ultrasound before IUI. For my IVF cycle, I underwent an antagonist protocol with follistim and menopur before freezing my embryos and surgically removing my tubes. My FET cycle involved orsl and vaginal estrace, as well as baby aspirin, estrogen patches, and eventually both progesterone in oil injections and Crinone. Adjustments were made after each monitoring appointment as we went. Monitoring hours - 7am to 9am, M-Fri STAT blood drawn at onsite clinic, transitioning toward in office blood draws. 

(I'm a tough blood draw so very happy to go to seasoned phlebotomists;) 

Weekend monitoring done at Harrisburg Hospital and only time you will have an ultrasound performed by non-RMA staff (between 7am-9:30am)

Bloodwork results and medication adjustments provided same day by nursing staff (usually between 2:30 to 3:30). Dr Nguyen will generally call with initial Beta results or if complications occur. 

IUI 1 & 2- Day 3 baseline u/s & E2, LH & Prog. bloodwork, clomid (can't remember when started, probably Day 2 or 3). Monitoring Day 9 (or perhaps earlier) thru LH surge, Ovidrel trigger night before IUI. Semen sample taken to office 45 minutes prior to IUI procedure for processing. Private room available for men if traveling a distance for procedure. Done during monitoring hours in a relaxing room. Beta hCG, E2 and Progesterone levels tested 9DPO. If positive, Beta and hormone levels taken every two to three day at least twice more. If normal- U/S follow up week 5 or 6 through 9 when referred back to OB. If abnormal- options for termination discussed or consulted through miscarriage. If negative, 

IUI 2 Beta was positive, but slow rising and indicative of possible ectopic implantation. In addition to Beta monitoring, had a diagnostic transvaginal u/s at 6 weeks, however Beta levels were too low to confirm place of implantation, tubes appeared normal. Pregnancy was terminated with Methotrexate injection and Beta was followed to 0. Liver panel and CBC was monitored prior to and after in office injection by nurse. 

IVF- estrogen primer protocol for low responders selected due to maternal age and unexplained infertility history (just turned 38 that month). Counseled to have PGS testing also due to age and hx-- Select CCS (Comprehensive Chromosome Screening). Monitored cycle prior to Stims to start estrace a week or two before Day 1. Day 2 AM u/s & bloodwork (E2/LH/Prog./FSH?)/PM first dose Gonal f & low dose hCG subcutaneous injections. Monitoring continued every other day to daily with medication adjustments, cetrotide added sometime around day 7-9 to suppress ovulation, hCG injection trigger 2 nights prior to retrieval with bloodwork monitoring the following AM to confirm it was administered properly. 

Egg Retrieval and Embryo transfer procedures are preformed at the King of Prussia surgical center NE of Philadelphia (1.5 hr from Harrisburg). ER scheduled generally before 9 am. Given a report of egg count post procedure after anesthesia recovery. Restart estrace (vaginally), start steriod, antibiotic, and crinone (progesterone vaginal gel).

Fresh embryo transfer scheduled for same time as ER on Day6 (if embryos make it to blastocyst stage by Day 5 and test euploid). Given report by embryology Day1, Day3 and Day5. Reports- 21 eggs retrieved, 17 fertilized normally by Day1, 10 Day3 with normal cleavage, 3 Day5 blastocyst tested- 1 euploid, 2 Day6 blastocyst tested, both euploid and frozen. 

Day6 fresh transfer (It's a girl!) (No anesthesia necessary, but have to drink 50-60oz water starting 1.5 hour prior to procedure. Very uncomfortable!) Beta follow up was normal. Embryo measured normal week6Day0 u/s. Heartbeat detected in week 7 Day 0 u/s. Continued monitoring through week9 and referred back to OB. Was told to follow up with NT scan and amniocentesis, but no further genetic screening was necessary due to PGS. We ignored Dr. Nguyen's advice and did not have an NT scan done between 12-14 weeks, thinking we had it covered on the genetic defect front and I was eating well/taking prenatals so not overly concerned about NTD. Unfortunately at our week 19 anatomy scan our daughter was diagnosed with Exencephaly a fatal NTD. Amniocentesis results indicated that karyotype was also normal. It was a ""fluke"" developmental defect. Follow your RE's advice, get the NT scan.

FET cycles- Dr. Nguyen allowed me the choice of having a synthetic or natural cycle (with estrogen primer control of ovulation or without estrogen) I opted both cycles for the greater predictability of synthetic cycle. Estrace started orally Day2 in the PM after AM u/s and bloodwork- taken AM & PM, dose upped then taken back down at ovulation. Progesterone in oil intramuscular shots started evening of ovulation (1/2cc) as well as steroid (7days). Progesterone upped to 1cc until Beta and continued to 10 weeks is positive.  Both cycles failed so I discontinued PIO and estrace day of Beta. 

Have consulted with Dr. Nguyen on next possible steps- 
Another stim cycle with either same estrogen primer protocol or a lupron microflare with PGS-- both are low responder protocols. My AMH has dropped from 2015 (2.27) to this September (1.32). Egg quality is a major concern, but Dr. Nguyen believes I will have a similar outcome to my first IVF cycle. Genetic screening protocols are changing in their lab, so we will not have the option for fresh cycle transfer, but will have both chromosome and karyotype testing performed for frozen transfer. She is also willing to perform an endo/scratch the cycle prior to our next transfer because we have had two implantation failures with euploid embryos. We may choose to have further immunological testing done prior to our next cycle due to our multiple losses (a blighted ovum- spontaneous conception, a presumed ectopic with IUI and our daughter's NTD, also euploid), and am in the process of looking into reproductive immunologists to work in consult with Dr. Nguyen. We are still unsure if we how far we will pursue further testing. Upon initial testing, I started taking synthroid for hypothyroidism. For the first cycle, we used letrozole and waited for me to ovulate on my own which  occurred very late. I also had a short luteal phase that month. In the following cycle, I used letrozole, ovidrel and progesterone to lengthen  my luteal phase. I became pregnant but unfortunately that pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. Based on my testing, dr gutman felt that we should try that protocal a few more times and I became pregnant on the second cycle after my miscarriage. We were at another clinic first, but felt the care was lacking, so when we came to Dr. Gutman we had already been through the first steps of trying to overcome fertility, which was artificial insemination for us. It failed. With Dr. Gutman, we went right into egg retrieval, which was, unfortunately, not successful. We felt she was responsibly prudent with her dosages of the fertility medications, which included Bravelle and others I can't remember at this time. Something else--during initial conversations with Dr. Gutman, once we revealed we were hoping to have two children and transferring multiple embryos would be welcome, she (once again, responsibly) declined to participate such treatment, for the sake of baby's health and mom's health. As much as we really would have loved a two-for-one, we knew she was right and stuck with her and her professional opinion that we trusted.We did IVF, using 5-day embryo's from retrieved from my wife and inseminated me via ICSI with donor sperm from a cryobank.  We then implanted the fresh embryo into me and did 12 weeks of progesterone injections.  We had a normal, successful pregnancy.  We froze the remaining embryos.My cycle is fairly regular. We used medicine like cloud and letrizole to induce ovulation along with hug injection to facilitate ovulation before undergoing IUI. This was followed by topical progesterone as I had a little dip in mid cycle progesterone level. I was never told I had poor eggs. We wanted to do IVF but I couldn't afford it. All of my blood work was ok. I also had a removal of uterine polyp which was small but she wanted to make sure that there was no problem with embryos implantation IVF was the first suggestion, due to male fertility factor. Doctor freedman started with standard IVF protocol, however initial round I did not develop enough follicles. Second cycle, estrace priming was utilized along with increase dosage of gonal f. After slight tweak moved forward with successful egg retrieval which resulted in 5 fertilized embryos. I did three IUIs with Letrozole. There wasn't really an explanation for the medication or dosages. When I asked the nurse about next steps after the second unsuccessful IUI, she pretty much conveyed that she wasn't sure, but probably the same thing. I asked for the dose to be increased and it was. My first retrieval I did 2 weeks of birth control followed by an antagonist protocol. Part way through my Menopur dosage was raised. I stimmed for 11 days and retrieved 8 eggs, all were mature, 6 fertilized, and 2 made it to blast. Both came back mosaic.

My second protocol we eliminated the birth control because Dr. Freedman thought it may have over suppressed me and we could get more eggs. Same medicine and we retrieved 13 eggs, 8 were mature, 6 fertilized, and none made it to blast. We were shocked and have no good reason why it happened. I am planning a microdose lupron protocol next month.I am in the beginning stage. We haven’t gotten to my protocol as of yet.We did 4 rounds of IUI with clomid and an ovidrel trigger for each attempt. I was not diagnosed with any infertility - but since we are a same-sex couple, we went to RMA. Insurance does not cover any of our treatments, so the next recommendation is IVF. I do not recall23 cycles too many too list
but she always explained her rationale and I always tusted herI would have to look back at my notes to remember the protocol.  I do remember that after the first failed transfer, he knew exactly what to do. We did a ""natural"" frozen embryo transfer the second time. Both were single embryo transfers. We used icsi to fertilize our eggs. We used Clomid, letrozole and IUI. I have regular cycle, normal uterus and endometrial lining. Tubes were patent. She never used the term unexplained infertility but I suspect that is what I have. We planned on injections but insurance would only cover it if the medicine was given in a medical short procedure unit. When I informed her of that , she didn’t think it was a good idea We started with basic testing. From there we talked about possible routes of treatment. We were given multiple options from a natural cycle to the use of some meds to help time IUI perfectly. We fell in the category of unknown fertility issues. We originally started with Clomid for a few months but still no success. We then tried IUI, the 1st time was a success unfortunately ended with a miscarriage at 9 weeks. We tried another IUI and we’ve been successful this far. We are going on 12 weeks and hoping for an amazing outcome.We did iui's. My previous doctor preformed other procedures to diagnose a problem if there was one. He played with dosage of medication and switched from oral to injectables. He monitored my follicles frequently by ultrasound. Ordered hsg to check for Fallopian tube blockage 2 iui cycles with clomid resulting in live boy birth 2006.
6 iui cycles: 5 with clomid, 1 injections.  1 viAL used each time.  No pregnancy.  Recommend ivf 
We were on the treatment path for male factor and then changed doctorsWe chose IUI first and did 6 rounds of clomid with IUI. One of the rounds we did not do IUI. I forget why. I had and hsg test done which was painful and I was in a lot of pain for a few days. Otherwise all tests were bearable. Medication was fine so farI am doing monitored cycles so I have ultrasounds every few days, take clomid and then do trigger shots.  After this is do iui procedure.  This is done to maximize the potential of getting pregnant with the iui.Struggled with a thin lining. Dr. Castelbaum attempted numerous protocols to try and thicken uterine lining with different forms of estrogen. Tried Neupogen washes in uterus, vaginal viagara, acupuncture. We had done clomid and timed intercourse. Letrozole and timed intercourse. Clomid, ovidril, and iui twice. We went for an aggressive egg retrieval protocol due to my infertility issues. All injectables and worked with my insurance to find the best cost sensitive medications.We tried clomid twice, once with iui, and then switched to femara for two cycles, once with iuiHe thought I was healthy and just hadn’t had good luck getting pregnant on my own so we tried IUI at first. He said if I was to get pregnant with IUI it would happen within the first three tries. The first two attempts were unsuccessful for us. We knew there were no other factors causing the infertility so we went for an IVF cycle instead of the third IUI. Now we are 3 months pregnant and we know that the baby is healthy from the genetic testing and all the screenings.I know I was an IUI patient. We froze my husband’s sperm for convenience, however when round 1 didn’t work (I truly think it was me not being relaxed, I was going through a stressful time at work), Dr. Gutmann recommended we use a fresh sample and we were pregnant that round! I honestly cannot remember all of the treatment strategies but I do know the one that works for me.  The ""Atomic Bomb.""  Dr. Castelbaum has to give me the maximum dose of medications (Menopur, Follistim) in order for me to produce even the smallest amount of eggs for an egg retrieval.   While neither of us were very confident that we would get many eggs, in the end, we had two frozen genetically tested ""normal"" embryos.  If it wasn't for Dr. Castelbaum paying very close attention to me during my treatment, he wouldn't have known to up the doses of the medications so I could produce more eggs and I most likely would have come up empty handed.  I think a lot of doctors would have just cancelled the cycle.  3 iui’s, an egg retrieval, polyp removal, and one frozen embryo transfer IVF round.6 rounds of clomid, 3 times with a trigger shot, 4, 3
Times with progesterone, one IUI. No pregnancy.We were given about a 20% chance of success with our own eggs after testing, vs 60% with a donor. As we were paying out of pocket, we knew we couldn't afford to try over and over, and we had to decide which was more important to us: the genetic relationship but with a much reduced chance of success, or having a much better chance of having a child with a donor egg. In retrospect, given the stress inherent in IVF with the hormone shots and whatnot, I'm really glad we went with a donor to limit all of that. Out of our 6 eggs, 3 became viable embryos, which is fantastic. We've only done one single embryo transfer cycle, and are now 12 weeks along. After the consult, Dr. Casselbaum ordered a variety of tests that needed to be done to ensure that the problem was nothing internal.  Genetic testing was also ordered.  Once of the results were in (which did not take long - maybe 2 weeks) we met with him again and he gave us our game plan.  He prescribed Femara to help me ovulate.  He specifically told me the days to take it and the days that we should have intercourse.  It did not work the first time.  It worked the second time, but it ended in a miscarriage at 7 weeks.  I did not work the third time.  It worked the fourth time and I am currently 9 weeks pregnant.Unexplained infertility, possible diminished ovarian reserve/male factor. Had done 1 IUI and taken clomid x1 at another fertility clinic. Did not want to do IVF for personal  reasons. Had 4 IUI w/ letrozole, one IUI w/ injectable and letrozole and took progesterone after- resulted in our daughter.I had unexplained infertility until our first consult with Dr. C.  As soon as he did an ultrasound he diagnosed me with Endometriosis and we made the decision to try IVF.  We proceeded with an egg stimulus process and egg retrieval.  He suggested I wait one full cycle for my body to recover from the retrieval before doing our first transfer.  Although I was excited to do our first transfer, I realized my body needed time to recuperate and heeded Dr. C's advice.  A year after the birth of our son, we returned to RMA and the next two transfers were unsuccessful (one negative, one miscarriage) and Dr. C suggested genetic testing for the remaining embryos.  We moved forward with genetic testing with resulted in two (out of the five remaining) viable embryos.  The next transfer resulted in a successful pregnancy and birth.  We returned to RMA this January to use our final remaining embryo.  During my mock transfer, the doctor saw a fibroid in my uterus.  Dr. C suggested I have it removed prior to our last embryo transfer, as he wanted to remove any risk of the transfer not working.  Again, although I was excited to do our last transfer, we heeded his advice again, and are now pregnant with that embryo. Each cycle we did an IUI assisted w/ Clomid. We started me at only 50mg, because I was diagnosed as unexplained and medically speaking, I have no reason to be infertile, nor does my husband. For the 2nd and then the 3rd IUI, we did 100mg of Clomid, with intention to reevaluate the drugs we were using if the 3rd did not work. Luckily the 3rd time was the charm for me. Dr Castelbaum prescribed Femera to assist in my ovulation since I was ovulating later in my cycle. We ended up having to use the trigger shot to induce ovulation early since my follicles were big and ready. I conceived without the use of IUI.Bc of my PCOS Dr. Castelbaum discovered that I was not ovulating and put me on Femara (Letrozole). First round (2 times a day twice a day), it was successful and we were able to go forth with IUI. Clomid and Letrozole, along with Ovidrelinjeections. I also received 4 IUI’s each for both pregnancies, and for both pregnancies, I ended up conceiving on the 4th IUI. Although statistics show chances decreasing after the third IUi, Dr. Freedman allowed me to stull try 4 IUI’s both times, which was my lucky number! He gave specific directions on when to take the medication and everything worked out great! As we PGS tested our embryos and as we are u dear 35, Dr. Gutmann would only let us transfer one embryo. This is the general practice at RMA.I was told we would only do single embryo transfer due to my age I am at his risk for complications in multiples.Dr. Castelbaum explained how dangerous multiple embryos can be for not only the mother but for the babies too.  I had no idea of the dangers of transferring multiple ""normal"" embryos.  I'm so happy that I chose a doctor that is more concerned with the mother and the child's health than about stats.I only had two frozen embryos and he decided to transfer one at a time Yes, doctor had strong preference to transfer 1 for goal of healthy singleton pregnancy.Strong preference for eSET not multiple. Dr. Castelbaum is a strong believer in only transferring one embryo. I was hesitant to agree but after he gave us the facts, I understood why and I knew he had my best interest in mind.He suggested one embryo transfer at a time because of my age.Doctor Freedman is adamant on one embryo at a time. Due to my age and first IVF attempt, we opted not to have embryos tested. After 3 failed single embryo transfers, doctor freedman suggested putting 2 in. Which resulted in singleton pregnancy. If embryos were tested, we would still do one at a time. He is very adamant that single is best, especially at my age.Only willing to do single embryo transfer He strongly recommended single embryo only.Dr. Castelbaum prefers to transfer one embryo at a time to achieve his and the parents goal of a singleton healthy baby.In our case due to age and egg reserve, Dr. Lange recommended when we proceed with IVF to do a single embryo transfer. I am unsure of other cases. Not applicable for our treamentI appreciate his conservative approach because the thought of carrying multiples worries me due to the increased health risks for myself and potential babies.N/aShe recommended single but was willing to do multiple due to recurrent miscarriages but explained the risks She would elect for in the future doing PGS testing and then transfer one embryo. She said, ultimately it would be our decision on transferring one or two embryos.RMA's policy is to transfer a single embryo unless it has been shown to be absolutely necessary to try multiples.He believes in PGS testing with one common goal, which is helping each mom have a healthy pregnancy with a healthy baby. He doesn't transfer multiple embryos if PGS tested.We haven't really dealt with this yet.I completely agreed with her reasoning for single embryo transfer given the increased risk to me and any potential fetus with multiples. MFM agreed as well. No commentNo commentNoDr. Castelbaum will only transfer one embryo if you are under a certain age (35).RMA is very clear about wanting to avoid multiples. I appreciated this approach. He strongly believes in single embryo transfers if at all possible. When I received my fresh and frozen transfer, I was 31. He felt I was young and healthy enough with no reason to transfer more than one egg.  No experience He believed in only one transfer if we did in vitro.Not applicableFirst cycle he transferred two embryos. Second and third cycle, only one embryo. Moving forward I think one embryo is the new normal to prevent premature birth of multiples. I think he’s very conservative Didn’t Do IVF YETDr. Castelbaum strongly preferred SET given our circumstances.From the beginning, Dr. C advised against multiple embryo transfer because of the risks associated.  Dr. had full confidence in eSET and was candid about the opportunity to have twins. His sentiments were in alignment with ours, so this was no issue. I could see how this might be a point of conflict for other patients.We never had the option to transfer more than one embryo.  However for our IUI with injections, Dr. Gutman was ok with proceeding with 3 or 4 mature follicles.She prefers to transfer one embryo at a time due to the risks multiples create.  I wanted to have a discussion about transferring two, which she happily obliged.  Due to my age and history of pregnancy loss due to cervical insufficiency, Dr. Gutmann and I both agreed to transfer only one embryo at a time. ",8.5,8.5,"First semen analysis showed slightly low sperm count and motility. About to start trying with IVF.She had me undergo a hysteroscopy prior to beginning the cycle. After 3 unsuccessful cycles I had a consultation with Dr. Gutman where we went over my body's responses to each cycle according to the monitoring. We ignored Dr. Nguyen's advice and did not have an NT scan done between 12-14 weeks, thinking we had it covered on the genetic defect front and I was eating well/taking prenatals so not overly concerned about NTD. My second protocol we eliminated the birth control because Dr. Freedman thought it may have over suppressed me and we could get more eggs. Dr. C suggested I have it removed prior to our last embryo transfer, as he wanted to remove any risk of the transfer not working. He suggested one embryo transfer at a time because of my age."
68,RMA of Philadelphia,cost,"1st cycle -- approximately $47,000
2nd cycle -- approximately $3,500We had insurance coverage during our treatment. It was really hard for our family because insurance did not cover any of our treatment. They were willing to work with us on paying for services rendered and also helped us with getting the medications we needed.self-pay: 18K for single IVF cycle with PGS and ERA biopsy, including meds, though some meds were covered by insuranceI had insurance coverage for almost all of my treatments.With my insurance, IUIs we're covered. I paid a $40 copay each visit. And I paid for the medicine out of pocket. I don't recall the medicine prices. For IVF, we paid all out of pocket. We did the RMA assure plan which costs in total with meds about $30,000 I paid  $16,000 for IVF  treatment which was never received
Insurance lifetime max was utilized, after this was hit I paid the difference cash. Currently covered by insuranceIUIs the most expensive part was teh donor sperm. copays each visit and my shots weren't covered. they were $99 a cycle.
during IVF i got into a package deal that was roughly $20,000 and meds were close to $5,000 each cycle.  No insurance coverage with IVF.  My Wife started IVF and her meds were mostly covered with a small copay.   We received grants from Hasidah and JFCS. that helped.  overall we spent about $80,000 for 3 years of infertilityClomid was cheap with our insurance but for the IUI package insurance covered nothing so we spent a total of about 2300$ for that cyclecosts were excellent, mostly covered by my insurance.It was covered under insurance I only had to pay for meds and co-paysOur insurance didn’t cover fertility treatments, therefore we had to pay for almost everything out of pocket. Finance will sit down with you and go over cost and payments.Expensive. It was under $1,300. IUI cycles were about 1,200 with monitoring but not including medications
IVF cycles range from 10,750-26,000 depending on need not including medicationThe out of pocket IUI package was $1800 and included everything but medication for a full cycle. I paid an additional $1800 for Menopur and $200 for ovidrel. We have no insurance coverage for fertility treatments, monitoring or medication.

Total was about $3300 per IUI. We completed two unsuccessful cycles and are beginning our third.The cost of an IUI cycle was approximately $1,000 and for an egg retrieval and transfer, it cost just over $10,000. My insurance has covered most of my treatment so far, with the obvious exception of copays.  The billing department gave me a vey clear break-down: if my pants come off, it's considered a specialist visit and I have a copay.  If I'm just coming in for bloodwork, I don't have a copay.

I've only had to pay for one medication out-of-pocket (Ovidrel), but the clinic referred me to a specialty pharmacy where I was able to get it for a low price.The insurance co-pays, the outside facility co-pays for blood work and imaging and the costs of the medicationsMy insurance only covered diagnostics for IVF so most of the cost was out of pocket. I paid total around $17,000 for the 2 fresh cycles. Medications for fresh cycle were around $3-4K (with discounts).  The frozen cycle was $3,000 and meds were about $500. Not sure With each visit I had a $30 copay.  All other treatment was covered except the cost of my donor sperm.  I had to pay out of pocket for two rounds of donor sperm which ran around $2000. I thought I would be eligible for a clinical trial which would cut my expenses but Dr. Gutman quickly informed me that I would not be eligible. Other than that, they did set up an appointment for us to speak with the financial team which we have not followed up with because at this point we only went to Dr. Gutman for a second opinion. The HSG test costs seemed high. Other costs were for office visits. I had insurance coverage so the total cost of meds plus treatment was under $5000 total.I have great insurance so costs we’re $40 copays, trigger shot was $100, other meds $60....total costs under $1,000.We had insurance (at the time) with a $6500 deductible. The deductible was met quickly,.then 80 percent was covered. For a full cycle, including monitoring, recurrent 
loss blood panel, karyotype testing and PGS testing, we paid about $5000 out of pocket.My diagnostic tests were covered by my insurance. $1200 per cycle for IUI, then additional cost of buying donor sperm online.Last year, I had a different insurance which covered most of my expenses. However, this year, my insurance isn't willing to cover more than 1 IVF cycle and only if done before April 29th. So, I'm not sure of out of pocket costsCopays for office visits were $20. Bloodwork only monitoring visits were free, ultrasound monitoring visits, IUIs, and longer personal meetings with Dr. Gutmann were a $35 copay.$1200 per monitored IUI cycleI believe the iui was 1,000 plus the cost of meds but I'm not 100% sure I took a new job and it did have coverage for iui so with my wife there were specialist copay so 40.00 each visit. The sperm cost 890 per vial and we have purchased a total of 9 and if costs between 250-400 to ship.Because Dr. Gutmann was treating both, my endometriosis, and fertility, my insurance was charged for each visit. My insurance didn't could IUI and IVF, though. We paid a copay each time except for blood only. Billing was the biggest disaster at RMA. we received many bills for hundreds of dollars for procedures that were covered by insurance. I would speak to someone in billing who would tell me they'd ""write it off"" ( not correct it), only to receive the same bill again.  We ultimately left because the billing issues became so stressful. In the end, I resorted to crying to billing personnel on the phone saying that I was forced to leave and figure out something with another clinic because we couldn't continue to accrue unnecessary charges if we weren't even seeing results. The woman's response was to offer a 3 way call with my insurance company to ""figure something out."" They refused to look into the issue. Later, we received more bills months after leaving... for my D&C no less, which was a painful reminder. Also the bills were in my husband's name this time,  for ""tramsvaginal ultrasounds."" He called and they again ""wrote it off."" We incurred few costs with this practice as IUI was covered under our insurance. We did pay out pocket for medications, but these were inexpensive.IUI cycle- $1,200 includes bloodwork through first Beta, u/s monitoring and IUI procedure
Does not include medication- Clomid covered by my insurance with copay. Ovidrel- ~ $100 including shipping w/pharmacy discount through RMA

(Note: options are changing in 2017 due to new PGS protocols)
IVF Multicycle Option w/RMAid 7.5% discount & Select CCS-~ $13,400
includes Dr. & Nurse consults mock embryo transfer (cycle prior to stim), bloodwork through 1st Beta, monitoring, anesthesia, egg retrieval, ICSI, embryo culture/embryologist fees, fresh cycle embryo transfer, also covers one Frozen embryo transfer in the event that fresh cycle transfer cannot be performed, fresh transfer failure or loss of pregnancy if FET can be performed within a 9 month period. (We ended up not having to pay additional fees for our first FET after our loss at 21weeks post fresh transfer). I believe this may have also covered vitrification of frozen embryos. 
Additional costs- $3,000 genetic testing  (covers 10+ (don't remember exact #) of embryo biopsies and can be transferred to multiple stim cycles if you do not meet the maximum number in any given cycle. We had 5 tested from our first IVF cycle, so will most likely not have to pay more for additional preimplantation genetic diagnosis in future cycles. I've talked with finance at RMA and this will be honored with the additional karyotype screening that will be added to the protocol in 2017.

(Note- all RMA multi-cycle options will be changing in 2017 due to new PGD protocol. My next stim cycle will likely be a single IVF cycle paid ""ala"" carte by service since I will not need to pay additionally for PGD. I was quoted and expense of ~$12,000 in expected costs including one FET transfer. 

Stim cycle medications (gonal-f 900cc injections pens, cetrotide, low dose hCG, hCG trigger shot & pregnancy support (Crinone 8%) through 10 weeks- 
$~6,000.00 with 25% compassionate care discount through Freedom Pharmacy. I was not aware to shop around for Crinone coupons and additional discount programs. I could have saved more. 
Co-pay through insurance- ~$30 to 60 for estrace pills, medrol (steroid) and antibiotic

FET cycle- $3,500 (without RMAid discount, but possible to qualify for financial aid through practice based on income/insurance coverage). 

Meds- estrace copay ~$20 -30, progesterone in oil intramuscular injections ~$40.00 for 30 day supply including shipping. 

Not covered procedures not covered in RMA plans- diagnostic exams and tests like maternal and paternal genetic screens, salinesonograms, hysteroscopy. I've had several genetic screens, (2) salinesonograms, (2) hysteroscopies including (1) endometrial polypectomy performed by Dr. Nguyen and all were covered by insurance. The RMA financial team and staff work hard to code procedures accurately, but in a way that will be accepted by most insurance carriers. I have a very restrictive HMO that does not cover any infertility treatment, but diagnostic screening and tests short of an infertility diagnosis are covered. 
I paid a copay of $40 for ultrasounds. I also had to pay a copay for medications. Nothing else. $18,000 for the failed IVF and egg retrieval
$6,000 for the medications
$3,000 ICSI genetic testing for the embryos
Don't remember how much the frozen egg and embryo transfer process costOur costs were minimal, as both my spouse and I had insurance that covered the vast majority of our drugs and procedures.  I think we spent between $2,500-$4,000 out of pocket.  But this was unique to us, due to our unusually generous coverage.  RMA did a great job, however, of liaising with our insurance carriers to determine and confirm coverage.Co pays were in line with my insurance. There was one fee associated with ICI that was charged to me because I wasn't using my husbands sperm/ I had to rely on donor sperm. I complained to the clinic, they said it was an insurance issue. It really upset me. I was a single mother and this felt like discrimination and I didn't really care if is an insurance issue or not. My insurance would have paid for the injectable medication if it were given in a medical short procedure unit. They said they didn't do it that way. I was not able to get full benefit of IVF due to these hurdles. I work in healthcare. I am able to be responsible for my own care. The drug cost was out of my control and I guess it was out of their control. I decided to pursue embryos donation. RMA had slim pickings when it came to donor embryos. She didn't refer me to the competing local clinic who I found out had a much more ample supply of donor embryos Some IUI cycles weren't covered by insurance and those were $1000, plus cost of medicine. I am uncertain. I started off with insurance but I am now self pay and am waiting to get exact self pay amount.We had to pay for everything except for diagnostic tests. I do not remember. Insurance covered most IUI, IVF was out of pocket They have package offerings for multiple cycles, which was so helpful and they figure out all payment options for you. I signed up for an embryo retrieval with icsi along with a fresh and frozen transfer.  The cost for these procedures, along with all ultrasounds and blood work, and medicine came to about 17,000.I had HRA plan. I had expected costs. My pharmacy plan did not cover injections. I had to pay out of pocket for spermI honestly don’t remember each cost as my insurance did not cover fertility treatment My insurance didn't cover the iui's or any in vitro fertilization.Billing was very helpful. They explained the costs with you prior to procedures and go over insurance policy. They are willing to set up payment plans 1250 for iui each cycle and about 900 for sperms vialPretty standardNot sure. Used insurance. Costs are very high.  I believe they are on par with other clinics but my insurance coverage is bad.Extremely costly. Did Donor Egg with a known donor and three frozen embryo transfers. ReasonableThe cost was fair, there were discounts because we are low income familyMy insurance covered everything! I had a copay until I became pregnant! $40 copay, $350 IUI, monitoring was covered by insuranCe I don't want to talk about exact numbers, but I will say that we consulted with another practice and RMA Philadelphia's pricing was much more reasonable. All pricing was done as packages. Since we were new to the process, we had a lot of questions, and the financing department understood the medical side of what was provided and were able to answer all of our questions. I spoke with an insurance counselor provided by RMA to inform me of what is covered by insurance and what would be additional costs.  Everything before IUI was covered by my insurance.  After that, the counselor provided me with the cost of each procedure so that I was aware before making a treatment plan.Mostly Covered by insurance- when some meds weren’t covered the clinic gave me samples which helped a lotWe were full pay out of pocket.I have very high coverage insurance, so I never paid more than my $15 copay for appointments. The one high cost I incurred was for the Ovidrel medication used once per cycle, as it was not covered by insurance. That was $170. My insurance covered most except copaymentsIt went through insurance and still working out my balanceMy insurance covered about 80% of our fertility treatmentMy insurance covered most services, but I paid out of pocket for
Medications. My insurance covered monitoring and bloodwork for IUI cycles.  Nothing was covered for IVF. RMA prices are high and they don't offer any bundled packages which is the main reason I am holding back on moving forward with another cycle.  If they offered better more affordable options, I would have started another retrieval already because I do feel comfortable and trust them.  They did offer a tiny discount however with my next cycle being my third round, I was hoping for a deeper discount than offered.  Our treatment leading up to IVF was covered under insurance.  I appreciate that she did not recommend IUIs (which would not be covered under my insurance).  Stating that they don't produce good outcomes and we would most likely end up needing IVF.  Total cost of IVF cycle with medication cost approximately $16kThe clinic offers various treatment package, including a shared-risk program for IVF. For us, we were lucky that insurance covered most of our testing and procedures. We only paid co-pays and coinsurance. ",8.5,8.5,"1st cycle -- approximately $47,000
2nd cycle -- approximately $3,500We had insurance coverage during our treatment. Bloodwork only monitoring visits were free, ultrasound monitoring visits, IUIs, and longer personal meetings with Dr. Gutmann were a $35 copay.$1200 per monitored IUI cycleI believe the iui was 1,000 plus the cost of meds but I'm not 100% sure I took a new job and it did have coverage for iui so with my wife there were specialist copay so 40.00 each visit. We incurred few costs with this practice as IUI was covered under our insurance."

70,Main Line Fertility  ,doctor,"Dr Glassner is confident, is able to build rapport very quickly and explains the tests, treatments and plan very accurately without overwhelming us.  I am fortunate to be in the medical field, but my husband is not, but Dr. Glassner was patient with him and was able to communicate equally well with both of us.  He is very straightforward and can seem a little blunt, but it helps reinforce his confidence and experience in what he does. We are currently going through an incredibly difficult ectopic pregnancy that we are treating with medications, and Dr. Glassner was available on call for questions.  He knows us by name, he is so optimistic it's infectious.  I don't think we would continue our pursuit of becoming parents without him.Dr Brasile started treating my husband and I over a year ago. We have done medical treatment x3 , IUI x3, IVF x2, and FET x5. Throughout our process she has always been honest but more importantly she was compassionate and kind. Throughout our struggles there have been lots of ups and downs. We appreciated all she has done for us and couldn't have chosen a better doctor. I felt as though he lacked compassion and that all he cared about was “selling” IVF. He was uninterested in helping us understand and was less than willing to research why my husbands sperm count was so low. Dr Brasile has been very transparent, and informative. She explains everything in detail and always answers any questions we may have. She explains things in an easy to understand manner, and makes sure we understand. She has been supportive throughout the entire process.Dr. Glassner will explain everything to you including all risks.  He is thorough and will answer any and all questions that you may have.  Our first retrieval didn't go as well as we hoped and he was the first to call me to discuss in detail and create a plan for a second retrieval that included slowing my body down so I could produce better quality/mature eggs.  He is excellent!Dr. Gocial is exceptionally compassionate, kind, ans caring.. I trust his expertise, he quotes studies and facts, tells you percentage of success rates. I am so happy to be in his care. He is responsive and I always know I can contact him and he will call back. He makes sure to answer all of my questions, and helps guide my next choiceHe is genuine , patient , caring and understanding . Has a tremendous amount of knowledge! He is always ready to answer any question you have and infertility can be very lonely but he knows where to point you in the direction to get all the help you need regarding the physical and emotional ! No part of your journey goes unnoticed or uncovered, it definitely helps to make the difficult journey of infertility that much easier. For everyone it’s their own reason why they need to use a dr to help create their family but as wide as the spectrum of creating babies is , dr glassner is educated in all of the different areas and the challenges they bring and emotions that may arise. He is truly a GIFT from G-d! With His help and the help from G-d I do believe after this coronavirus we will be able to use our created embryos that he did for us and transfer them to our gestational Carrier and still receive the BEST care from him even though we’re nit the ones pregnant and our carrier is carrying for us. I believe G-d gave me a uterus to bring a life into this world and G-d took it away to save my life! I had an emergency hysterectomy during the birth of my first child. Dr Glassner made me feel better through our situation that even though I’m missing a uterus I have a life and my life means something more than my uterus , he made me feel we can have a child through surrogacy and help it be as “normal” as possible. No one is alone when you have Dr Glassner. I'm somewhat concerned about the communication, record-keeping/tracking and even the quality of care.  I was told during a hysteroscopy that a biopsy was being taken (though not why or what it would inform) and it was noted in the report, but apparently nothing was sent to the lab and it was never reconciled as to why.  Also, I keep copies of all of my medical records for times when I change providers, but the hysteroscopy - and all other treatment cycle notes - were scant, hand-written notes that other reproductive endocrinologists who reviewed them found surprisingly limited and difficult to interpret.  Every  diagnostic or treatment I've undergone elsewhere came with a complete typed report clearly describing what was done, why, and the outcome.  

Also, we did an ERA cycle which was almost cancelled because my lining didn't thicken sufficiently, but Dr. Orris continued it anyway and did the ERA (which I had to pay out of pocket for).  Only later did I learn from another reproductive endocrinologist at a large teaching hospital that ERA is not an especially useful test in the best of circumstances, and that a result from the end of what would otherwise have been considered a failed cycle cannot be interpreted in any way that would guide treatment during a successful cycle.  So if I really wanted a result that had any chance of being a predictive guide, I'd have to do (and pay for) it again.  I am very impressed with Dr. Orris and his setup at MLF.  His resident, Dr. Kurtz, was super helpful and he was there along the way to help administer any advice or diagnosis.  I am so thankful that my experience with infertility was handled by the folks at MLF.  Dr. Glassner is genuine and very experienced with what he does. He seems to be able to properly readjust fertility plans to get desired outcomes. He’s willing to take a more aggressive approach in fertility treatment. The only downside is that the clinic is busy and if you want to meet with Dr. Glassner there can be long waiting periods. Dr. Glassner is very precise with procedures, uses science to support his logic, and has years of experience and a caring mindset with which he approaches our treatment and plan. He is able to introduce humor to a stressful situation and relax the room. His confidence is contagious. I am hopeful that we are in good hands. I would recommend Dr. Glassner to my family and friends in a heartbeat. Dr. Gocial is someone I would refer a friend to without hesitation.  He is empathetic and sensitive to the emotions that this journey may stir.  Every visit he will shake our hands and ask us how we are doing.  He explains everything in a manner that is easy to grasp and always asks if we have any questions.  Like most couples, we never expected to be in this position but we are thankful we found Dr. Gocial to guide us through it.Strengths: He represented himself as wanting to take an ""aggressive"" approach (he used that word a lot), and that sounded appealing to us. I wasn't getting any younger and we just wanted to hurry up and have the kid already.

Weaknesses/things that were not to my taste: As I said before, he seemed to take somewhat of a generic, impersonal approach to our case. He talked about getting me pregnant rather than getting me a live birth (my problem was/is multiple miscarriages and I felt he was not paying attention to that). He did not ask any particulars about the past miscarriages and did not seem to think that any details were relevant. He adopted a very masculine/""bro"" attitude toward my husband; maybe other men like that or feel it addresses their insecurity around infertility treatments but we thought it was weird. He informed me what we were going to do (medicated cycles, combo of clomid/letrozole), rather than advising and explaining a course of treatment. The first cycle (clomid + timed intercourse) did not work. The second cycle when I came in shortly before ovulation, he informed me (rather than suggesting to me) that we were going to do an IUI. When I expressed some hesitation, saying that I'd heard success rates were not much higher than timed intercourse for people with my medical history, he retorted in a snappy tone of voice, ""Fine, then don't do it."" And turned away and started ignoring me. I finally agreed to the IUI but I felt like I was bullied into it. It didn't work anyway. For the first time in my life I was having trouble getting pregnant--when I had come to him not for help conceiving but with figuring out what was happening with my miscarriages.

The following year, I went back to MLF for monitoring on a new pregnancy (that we conceived on our own, not with their help) and ended up seeing him a couple times during that period. First, he gave me false hope when Dr Glassner had been telling me to prepare for another loss; when it finally ended in miscarriage again he came across as cold and unsympathetic. He scheduled me for a D&C--did not ask my opinion or preference--and again started talking about ""getting aggressive"". I let him do the procedure but I will never go back to him after this.Please see my previous comments.  The only reason Dr. Glassner didn't do all my procedures of IUI's except for one, is because I always fell on a weekend for the procedures. He did do my egg retrieval and I will, will myself for him to do my transfer when the time comes. His bedside manner is beyond impressive and always makes me laugh. I've never felt stressed or anything at any of my visits. I wish I saw him more during the IVF stage, but you can ALWAYS request to see him when you schedule your appointments. Although we have still not been successful, I have been very happy with my treatment to date.  Dr. Gocial always listens to my concerns with compassion and presents options to consider.  I appreciate that I see him often during each cycle so I have the opportunity to ask questions when needed.He just seems to be super busy and I felt like I was always rushed when speaking with him. I did not see him right before my retrieval or even afterwards which was disheartening that he didn’t check on me. He does seem to know what he’s talking about & I trust his expertise but he talks fast and very candidly without a lot of time for questions Dr. Gocial is one of the most caring doctors . Although the end goal is a healthy pregnancy, he always considers me and my health. He always is concerned about my mental health . I never leave a visit felling lost or confused . He gives me all the options and we decide together . I wouldn’t trust anyone else . He is thorough, to the point, but yet still compassionate. I felt comfortable and safe in his care. It is clear that he takes pride in his work and wants the absolute best case scenario possible for every patient. Although I do not see Dr. Glassner each time, when I do he is very open and honest about the route of treatment and what needs to be done. While he is clear on the information he gives,  he does so in a way that makes the patient feel comfortable.  He seems to understand this process is emotional and caters to that when discussing treatment, issues, etc, with his patients. Dr.Brasile has been wonderful.  I find her to be a healthy balance of both compassion and matter-of-fact.  She's obviously very confident in her position and knows what she's doing, so she can come across as hurried, but she always takes the time to answer all of my questions and make sure I know what to expect next.  And when I freaked out to the point of tears and passing out from working myself up over my first hysteroscopy, she was so kind and comforting.  Didn't make me feel like the mess I was, which I totally appreciated. When I came out of my first egg retrieval with only one healthy embryo, she adjusted the plan and our course of action.  She recommended another round of stims and retrieval, but left it completely up to us, no pressure.  We agreed, upped my meds and went at it again.  We're currently waiting for our embryo transfer. All of that said, it wouldn’t be fair to leave out that I was beyond devastated when she accidentally told me the sex of the embryo.....I believe accidents happen and I don’t know who is to blame for the slip. It doesn’t really matter. Just a part of our story now. Dr. Glassner is very knowledgeable and fairly blunt in his explanations.  I personally appreciate the bluntness when it comes to my body, limitations, and expectations. Although blunt. it is evident Dr. Glassner cares about you as a person and helping you achieve my goals of having children is his complete focus.  His humor and bedside manner was very helpful in alleviating stress and anxiety during procedures. Dr. Glassner has a very specific style for his bedside manner. He has a good balance of jokes during his visits which we like, it provides levity to a situation that often feels heavy and anxiety ridden. He also knows when to share empathy and provide hope to his patients. During our first meeting, he shared his personal stories of fertility challenges, and was able to relate to my husband and made my emotional and physical needs feel met. If you’re ok with a very direct doctor (there’s no sugar coating here) and one that can make you laugh, then he’s your guy!My experience with Dr. Orris has been better than expected. I was so scared and nervous I'd need a D&C because the lining of my uterus was so thick. He decided to do a Hysteroscopy and go in and remove all the extra tissue and was so nice about it. He talked to me and my husband the entire time making me feel so comfortable and was so excited about how every thing looked afterwards. Made me feel like we finally had a fighting chance. I haven't experienced any negative or bad appointments with him. Dr. Glassner was fantastic from start to finish. He is warm, caring, thorough, and funny, which helps when the nerves of fertility treatment set in. He took time to help me understand exactly what the plan was and made sure we both were in it together to achieve the same goal. When things didn't work out as planned, he was there to make me feel optimistic again and help me understand that IVF takes time. I am forever grateful for the Dr. Glassner's expertise and the gift he helped me create, my daughter. I never felt like just a number, I always felt important and that Dr. Glassner shared the same goals I had for myself. Definitely knows his stuff. Tries to find the best treatment for the patient but a lot of patients dont have the financial means or insurance coverage to proceed with a aggressive approach like IUI or IVF. InjectablesHe seems to have a LOT of experience. From the first meeting I felt that he was going to be completely honest with me, and he even told us that he would give me the same advice he would give to his sister or someone else in his family that was going through this. He also brings a light side to things and jokes around - after all... what else can you do in this process? I would 100% recommend him to anyone else. Dr. Brasile created my IVF protocol with all of my test results in mind. Sometimes, clinics just have a standard protocol that is used for everyone, but she made sure to customize the protocol based on my body's response to previous cycles and tests. She is always positive and makes you feel so hopeful, but is also straightforward with facts and explanations. Dr. Glassner is friendly, has a great sense of humor, and is patient. He meets with us every time we have a visit at the doctor's office and explains exactly what is happening and what we should next. He answers any questions we have and answers them thoroughly. He gives his expert advice to help us make informed decisions on our health and fertility treatments. His bedside manner is what makes him stand apart from most doctors. He is personable and you really feel like you have all his attention when you are in his presence. My experiences with IVF have been tough, to say the least, as many patients will agree. Being a patient of Dr. Glassner, I always know what to expect. He is very blunt about your diagnosis, steps to take in your infertility journey, the prognosis of pregnancy, and everything in between. If you like someone to be nothing but straight forward with you, Dr. Glassner is your man.  He takes the time to answer any questions or concerns, and I never leave feeling like I have no idea what is going on. No question is a dumb question with him. I always feel as though I am taken seriously, my concerns are valid, and my questions are answered. Dr. Glassner knows my case inside and out, no matter how long of a break I may take between cycles. He remembers what I have been through which is so important to me, mainly so I don't have to relive the bad. Financially, IVF is a struggle for us, and Dr. Glassner has gone above and beyond to make having a baby a reality for us. Have I gotten the results I wanted? No, not yet, but I am confident Dr. Glassner will get me there. She is a very “no nonsense”? Get straight down to business personality. I believe she is very knowledgeable, but she never asked me how many children we would like to have. We just went straight to IUI, the 1st try failed and I am in the TWW for my 2nd IUI now. Dr Glassner always made time for us and never made us feel rushed. As disapponting as many months were he still had faith and never moved to a treatment that we weren’t 100% confident.  He never wanted us to walk away and made sure he did what he could to not let that happenDr. Orris is caring but also serious. He doesn’t sugarcoat his diagnoses. He’s optimistic and believes that we can get pregnant using our own eggs and sperm. However, he has also given us options Incase that does not work. Dr. Orris is matter of fact and not as warm or chatty as I have been used to in the past, but he is professional and sometimes humerus, which makes me smile. I trust his judgement. Dr. Orris thinks outside the box. He doesn't want to load you up with medicine if he can avoid it by using what your body produces. He is creative with his approaches and even when we had failed cycles (which we did 5 times so far), he manages to give us a sense of optimism by clearly explaining his plan. He doesn't take unnecessary chances which is why he immediately recommended that we go with egg donor vs. mine. I believe that by suggesting that approach he saved us tens of thousands of dollars. I believe & trust in him 100%. He got me pregnant once and I know he can do it again.He could be very understanding and compassionate at times.  He understood our financial situation and was willing to work with us when our insurance ran out.  He was upfront with us in the beginning saying that due to my age the odds were against us with using my own eggs but he was willing to try.  He continued to support us with each attempt we made.  He always reminded us that we had to take not only our financial situation but our mental situation into account with each attempt always asking how we were holding up and if we could go through with another retrieval.  Each time he was honest about our chances.  My experience was great.  He was very honest and transparent during the entire process. We were never given false hope , everything was explained in detail. There was a plan and it was followed.  He really does care about his patients and was very open about giving advice if we encountered a tough situation. During the sad time of a chemical pregnancy he took time to sit and discuss everything that happened and ensured i had further testing done to see if this was a random occurance or a deeper issue like a clotting disorder. Dr. Orris is very open, clear, and honest. We knew what we were going to get from him and we knew when it was a risk for us to proceed that month even if the numbers were there. He was very honest with us, but let us make the decisions. He told us from the beginning that with the numbers ivf may be the best but we didn’t want to jump right to that and with us being young he was excited to try to explore different options. Easy to ask questions and you knew you were going to get a real response from him. Dr. Glassner speaks very quickly and answers questions without much detail. My husband had a vasectomy which is why we have been going through IVF. He never explained that the sperm aspiration could prevent us from successfully reversing the vasectomy later. When we did not see the predicted follicle growth he never changed course. He only personally performed one of my three embryo transfersDr. Glassner clearly explained all options, potential outcomes, and risks. He was always there for us for the key procedures and appointments. He was awesome at giving good news and also helped us through some bad news along the way.Dr. Orris is incredibly smart and I've always trusted the decisions he was making about my treatment plan. He is very nice, but also very matter of fact, so it was important that I ask questions and ask for things to be further explained if need be. He's made it clear that he is invested in the process with us and that he will do all he can to get us pregnant.Dr. Glassner is a protective, assertive, and optimistic doctor who sets realistic expectations with patients about the course of treatment and what to expect. He is very thorough, uses every form of treatment available, is amenable to payment plans and understands unique life circumstances that can both aid and deter fertility. Because he splits his time between two clinics, he wasn't always there when I needed to have an appointment, but Dr. Glassner would leave explicit instructions for the nurses that they should call him before prescribing treatment no matter what the doctor on call prescribed. He is always available to answer questions, and takes every patient concern seriously.I am a person who needs a plan. Dr Brasile met with me after each visit to discuss the plan for the next few weeks. After my first IUI, we made a plan for the next 2 months - just in case it didn't work. I felt very comfortable knowing that we had backup plans in place and I knew what would be next. She is organized, respectful, and very good communicator. Dr. Gocial was very open in reviewing test results and answering all my questions in detail. He was clear about chances of success with IUI, IVF and egg donation, as well as explaining the costs and making recommendations. He was willing to spend the time I needed to really understand my options and to discuss a plan. He explained what medications I would be taking and why we were starting at a particular dose. I felt very comfortable speaking with him and trusted his recommendations. I loved Dr. Glassner. Some say his bed side manner isn’t the best. We truly had no issues with him at all. I recommend him to everyone and anyone i know who needs fertility help. Without him, and his PA we wouldn’t have our two girls. I owe him everything. Although the process can be stressful, he made it a little more bearable. The thing I was most afraid of was a doctor who would tell us there was still hope when there was not - that we'd have a doctor who would exploit the fact that I wanted to be pregnant so badly. 

Dr. Glassner never, ever held back bad news from us. We had a lot of it, and he was always compassionate but honest. He didn't couch the crappy stuff in weird euphemisms and vague promises. Every single time a cycle was weird, he would change course the next time to try and outsmart my body. Eventually, it worked! I am so thankful for him.The reason we initially traveled to see Dr. Glassner was because the Tay-Sachs Foundation shared with us his willingness to work with our financial situation in order to cover part of the costs of having to do ICSI, PGD, etc. to avoid having a child impacted by tay-sachs.  Although I wouldn't say he was the 'perfect' doctor, I will be FOREVER grateful for his generosity and willingness to work with us.  I do think I didn't have my eyes wide open about how hard the process would be, how time consuming it would be to wait for the PGD part of the process, and how we literally were down to 2 embryos by the end, one of which was clearly not going to make it.  I learned a lot from the process - not sure if Dr. Glassner could have helped more in explaining that, or if I just wasn't able to hear it at the time.i initially worked with Dr. Pfeffer who has since retired.  When going to an appointment, I would see one or the other and whoever was available for the IUI would perform it.  I was a single mom by choice and he was honest with me, about my age and what he recommended I do to get the best result, a pregnancy.My case was a HARD case of unexplained.  If you have uncomplicated infertility issues (blocked tubes, low sperm count) I think he would be great. If you have a more complicated case involving uterine or pregnancy losses for unknown reasons, I am not sure it will be the best fit. Sometimes I felt like he was too flippant and cocksure that he'd be able to get me pregnant and didn't have enough regard for the emotional effects. On the other hand, I think he did give me unique care and didn't treat me like a number, he did try to tailor things for my case. He though, along with 3/4 other docs I saw missed underlying Endometriosis and Adenomyosis which surely interfering with implantation. He is kind, patient, compassionate and honest. He shares his personal stories and is warm and funny. He has taken a lot of time with us answering questions. We never felt rushed and love that. He is wonderful!Dr. Brasile was very aggressive with my treatments. We went straight to IUI based on tests from my previous clinic. I was able to see her at every visit and she made time to talk with us whenever needed. We felt very confident with her at first, but after time I felt like just a number. I saw her less and less. I felt like I wasn’t given much attention because I wasn’t at a point to pay for IVF yet. Neither Dr. Brazile not anyone from the practice followed up with me after I underwent IUI. Dr. Orris was very knowledgeable. Although we did not have a successful pregnancy, he did all he could do. He did not push us to do think we could not afford. And was honest about our chances of getting pregnant at my age. 
When I had my 3 miscarriages, he prepared me for what would happen. But was not very sympathetic to our emotions.Dr. Orris has made this journey so far, one of comfort and understanding. He always makes sure he has time for his patients. You can tell he loves what he does and that for him he isn’t satisfied until he makes your dreams a reality.He is the most compassionate and caring doctor I have ever seen. Always encouraging us at each visit. He jokes around to try to make you smile and laugh when you are having a rough time dealing with everything going on. Which always helps. He gives renewed hope with each failed attempt. I feel confident having Dr. Glassner as my doctor. He explains everything in detail and in a way I can understand. I got pregnant on my own but miscarried and the empathy and understanding through that experience was wonderful. He helped me and my partner understand what happened and how to move forward. We are currently still trying to get pregnant.Dr. Glassner is very open and honest with you, but he does provide hope for everyone...even if odds are bleak.  He is willing to work with each patient as an individual, knowing not everyone is the same.  After my miscarriage, he called me with results, and several months later, he called me for a 'mental health' check inGoing into see Dr.Orris we knew that we had male factor. Not only was he professional, he made sure we understood everything! He also referred us to the best fertility urologist in the area and communicated with him to give us the best treatment possible Dr Glassner is the reason my husband and I came to Main Line Fertility to seek treatment. I felt like I was receiving the best of care from him. He was very thoughtful and thorough with his explainantions of what to expect and what he foresees the outcome to be. His confidence in his abilities and his staff is very reassuring.He was very candid during my 1st visit which set the tone of my time there.  I would have liked more explanation of my challenges instead of what I felt were standard answers for someone my age (almost 40.) Overall, I feel like he responds well to my ongoing treatment setbacks.Dr. Brasille is a very knowledgeable doctor. I was taken care of very well under her care. She’s friendly, outgoing and very personable. I love that in a doctor. The only concern I had with her had to do with my retroverted uterus. And sometimes after my IUI’s I was in pain. She is a fully competent doctor and I have no doubts in her ability to create a healthy baby for couples!  Dr. Glassner is the best.  He is a no nonsense tell you like it is doctor.  Put everything into plain terms that you can understand.  Hes not against telling you it wont work or the other doctor you saw fed you a line of bullshit.  I appreciate that in a doctor.  He is compasionate caring and has a weird but great sense of humor.  Dr Glassner has wonderful bedside manner and for such a delicate, sad and lonely condition, he did all that he could to make us feel at ease. I would highly recommend to any couple looking for help! This was a welcomed change from our prior experience at another fertility group.I saw Dr Glassner for a second opinion. He was quickly able to answer my questions and offer me reassurance where it was needed. Throughout the process he explained why he was changing things around and answered all of my concerns. Yes, he's a busy doctor, but he makes sure he puts the time in to bring out the best outcome! He has a more individualized approach than other doctors. I wish he would have met with me more and spent a little more time with us.  I mainly just saw the nurses who were great.  He didn't talk much I had to initiate most conversations and ask all the questions.  I had faith in his work from all the other great reviews and success stories he recieved. He's a great doctor with a lot of experience. His compassion shows in all of his work. He shared that communication is very important to him and that he'd always be upfront with us. He definitely has done that up to this point. The thing that has made the most difference to us is his flexibility and willingness to provide more than one treatment option for us and allow us to decide what works the best for us. He knew a lot of the latest studies and had a lot of knowledge. He called me himself after two chemical pregnancies. He always had an option for continuing. He is he warmest but he knows his stuff and more has the attitude of Getting it done. After a horrible experience with my 1st RE, he was determined to help me have a family. Dr. Glassner never gave up on me. He treated me with respect, he allowed me to grieve after each cycle and move to the next treatment at my pace. Dr. Glassner always has something nice to say to lighten the mood and everyone feels comfortable around him! He listens to his patients needs! When one thing doesnt work he doesnt give up! He sits down and creates a new plan for u! He is also very supportive!Knowledgable, straight forward and  understanding. He did not question my decision to use a sperm donor or my marital status, only offered his medical advice which was appreciated. He outlined the first approach and if that was unsuccessful options for next steps.Dr Glassner is by far the best fertility doctor I have ever seen. He is extremely compassionate and understanding and patient and honest. I loved going to see him and fully trusted him and his team were doing the right thing for my treatments each time. He was there to answer any questions. When my mother in law died and we missed an IUI he personally called us. He cares about his patients and knows that this is an emotional journey. He takes his time to walk you though concerns and gives you his best senerio Dr G is a compassionate dr who deeply wants husband patients to experience pregnancy.  He is always there when you need him and goes out of his way to help.  That being said, he can also be brash and jovial in his bedside manner which some may find off putting. He is very confident in himself and his work, but he has reason to be.  He has a vast knowledge and experience both personally and professionally. In our first meeting with him, he looked at our file and apologized for what we had been through.  He felt there was nothing standing in the way of a successful pregnancy for us.  When you were in front of him, you were the most important person in the room.He got me pregnant on my first round of IVF so I can't argue with the results! I saw all three doctors in the practice at one time or another. I felt that Dr. Orris was more optimistic about the possibility of getting me pregnant through IUI (which was unsuccessful). It was after seeing Dr. Glassner that I was encouraged to move right on to IVF if I wanted to be aggressive about getting pregnant. Dr. Orris sometimes says some funny things, like ""You've got a monster follicle that's about ready to blow"" and prescribed my husband and I to ""knock the boots"" on certain dates! But he clearly knows what he is doing.He went above and beyond. He was willing to work with our budget and do the testing and procedures we asked for. He never gave up on us. He said he would do what it takes to get us pregnant and he did us that. When we lost our first baby at 11weeks he was so compassionate. Dr. Glassner is straight forward and to the point. He’s funny and down to earth and honest. He provided our options and was flexible when we wanted to go a different route. He explained all options and pros and cons. Dr Glassner is the most honest, caring and thorough doctor I have ever had. He feels your pain and wants what’s best for you. He helps lighten the mood with humor. He is generous. He will work with you financially if you are struggling. Dr. Glassner is compassionate and treats you like family. Michael Glassner always went over and beyond to help us and do the best he could do to give us a family. Always honest and blunt. Treated us like family!! Took the time out for me every visit and never felt like just a patient. I think he is very very good at what he does, which is why I'm still undergoing treatment with him. However, he is a very fast talker, not very good at explaining things (and his handwriting is terrible) and is not very compassionate. He once told me ""Don't get any older."" That is really an insensitive remark to say to someone undergoing ART mostly due to their age. If you are looking for warm and fuzzy, he is not it. He was very smart and got me out of there in less than a year. He did not waste my time and I appreciated that. he seemed very smart and knowledgable about the latest technologies and what was available to me.Dr Glassner is very candid. He treats his patients as he would treat his family members. While he can be hard to get a hold of, he knows what he is doing. He is very logical which might rub some people the wrong way but I appreciate.I would absolutely recommend if the person knows there will be quick visits, not a lot of fluff. Just follow his directions. He knows what he’s doing. If you want more of a bedside manner and explanations he won’t be a good match. Dr. Glassner and the nurses took my concerns seriously and explained all the treatment plans in depth. Dr. Glassner let me have a voice in all decisions related to my care. That, in my opinion, is what makes the practice so good... I spent more time with the nurses than with Dr. Orris. However, my interactions with him were always positive and I had complete confidence in him the first time I met him.Open, honest, knowledgeable, personable with patients. Cares about you and your goals. I am forever thankful for him and his help to get pregnantDr Glassner is an aggressive and funny RE. He's a realist, too, but he will treat you as aggressively as you want. He tells you all the options, and lets you choose. I appreciated his compassion and levity in what was (and is) an emotionally wrenching process.My experience with Dr Glassner couldn't be better, I felt guided and helped all the way through the fertility treatment.Dr. Glassner is very straightforward when he speaks. He is not the type to beat around the bush, he is gets straight to the point (which I prefer). My experience so far has been great. I am not the type to be sad about my situation, but rather eager to find a solution. Dr. Glassner had the same feeling and is eager to find a recipe that will result in a healthy baby.Very experienced and skillful. Too bad that I went through painful polyp removal surgery instead of fixing my husbands'  fertility problems on the first place. I cannot find explanation why they do not offer serious anesthetics , but instead suggest to take Tylenol pills before performing painful operations.I feel like I barely saw him. Always felt rushed. At first we really trusted him because everyone we asked said he was the one. Then our experience was not that. Unexplained infertility, pushed us to IVF and it was unsuccessful, then says oh it’s probably PCOS. After 2.5 years you’ll diagnose me with one of the most common reproductive disorders? No. I just felt like a number and like he didn’t really care. He also made things sound super easy like it would definitely happen and 20 grand later it didn’t. It was disappointing to say the least. I felt misled. Dr.B is friendly and kind. She’s warm and funny. My only concern has been that wait times can be long, the clinic can be very busy and she can seem rushed. This sometimes makes me feel pushed along, and often think of questions after the fact. Friendly, but states things honestly and up front. He always used my name and answered any questions that I had. He made me feel comfortable when I was extremely nervous to have a Male doctor. He has definitely met my expectations and exceeded in excellent patient care Dr. Glassner never gave up on us, even in our hardest times. He was encouraging and compassionate. I truly credit him for getting us to our goals. He got personal, showing true emotion and empathy. He is incredibly knowledgeable and put us on an aggressive plan that worked.I cannot say enough nice things about Dr. Orris. I would never change doctors, even though I have yet to have a baby yet. I truly believe he is our miracle man. He has never left my side, and always knows what to say to keep me positive. You can tell he really cares about you as a patient. I recommend him to everyone who is struggling. Dr Glassner and all the team are very considerate and kind, they make patients feel comfortable during every procedure they go through. They explain results and status in detail, as well as the planned strategy.After 2 miscarriages, we went to see Dr. Glassner for help.  We were able to conceive after 6 cycles, but we found out that the pregnancy was not normal, though we weren't sure why initially.  Dr. Glassner and his team helped us through the few first days after finding out our pregnancy was not going to continue.  He was able to determine the cause and spent hours working with us to determine a treatment and the next steps.  After going through 2 miscarriages alone, with only minimal input from our regular OB/Gyn, Dr Glassner's help and assistance lessened the heartache, sadness and confusion and has us optimistic for the next steps.  We told ourselves we would not continue pursuing having a child, but his support is helping us to keep trying to achieve our dream of becoming parents.Dr Brasile is very compassionate and always took the time to make my husband and I feel like we were getting her best care. We consulted with Dr. El-Roiey after a year and a half of infertility. He went through and did all of the diagnostics, and blatantly told us we “needed IVF” and this was our only option to conceive. I am 26, my husband is 27. We were not expecting some terrible news like this, and he was hardly compassionate. He was unwilling to try other options than IVF and when I asked questions just felt like he was annoyed by the questions I had after researching. Everyone is friendly and professional. They speak to you by name every time, and do their best to review your case prior to any appointments, so they have the latest and most accurate info. They have been supportive and informative every step of the way.Dr. Glassner is so kind and spends time with you answering every question that you may have. dr. Gocial was always heart felt, never felt rushed, called me back, answered all my questionsI felt like a human because he has such care and concern and treats you like your the only one in the work at the moment he’s helping you that it feels like he’s full force there for you the whole way on your journey I saw Dr. Orris 3 times.  The first two felt fine, but the last one was really uncomfortable.  I had assumed we were stopping because the previous cycles had not been successful, and I was exhausted and ready to go elsewhere and try a new approach.  But he seemed irritated with me, somewhat dismissive, and just told me what to do, even though the logistics of it presented a huge challenge given that I was also in the processing of moving across country,  changing jobs and had no local clinic set up.  The staff at MLF were so wonderful and helpful; all the doctors clearly explained everything to me at every visit.  After each ultrasound and bloodwork, I was taken to the doctor's office to go over results/next steps.  Every one's bedside manner was extremely warm.Dr glassner has a very busy schedule but will take the time to speak with you and answer all of your questions. He’s very personable and genuinely seems to care about your infertility goals. Dr. Glassner is genuinely a caring person with a good sense of humor. On our first visit, he said that when we are in his office, he will talk to us about our case as though we are his own children. We have always felt that intimate care, compassion, and consideration for our case. Dr. Gocial is extremely kind and sensitive.  He has an excellent bed-side manner.  He always takes the time to explain things thoroughly and in a manner my husband and I can understand and always answers any questions we may have, no matter how many or how silly they be.When he was ready to see you, he would stand at the end of the hall and shout your name (rather than looking into the waiting room and making eye contact). He made no real effort to listen to our specific concerns. Instead, he seemed to assume that he knew right away what our problem was and he recommended a cookie-cutter approach that did not seem to take any of our particulars into account. He kept using generic language like, ""we'll get you pregnant,"" completely disregarding that our problem was repeated miscarriages and that in fact we conceived easily several times on our own. To be fair, I think he *thought* he was being personable and congenial, making chitchat, but it came off as insincere and like he was not really listening.Dr. Glassner is the most caring, thoughtful man, and doctor I've ever come across. I started going to him towards the end of 2017 to have a Fertility work up as a single woman. From the beginning I knew he was the right doctor for me. He ran every test under the sun and then some. After talking he advised that there really shouldn't be any issue of me getting pregnant. Donor sperm was perfect. He advised just because my periods were slightly irregular that I should start Metformin. It helps with balancing levels that women with PCOS usually have. It helped me lose 30 pounds. I started taking Metformin for about 6 months and was ready to finally start my IUI's. Dr. Glassner prescribed me Letrozole, for my first cycle. He knew I was excited and he set expectations for me saying IUI's usually don't work on the first try. He was right it failed. Went in for 4 more IUI's each time changing meds. One cycle was just Clomid. Another cycle was a combination of both maxed doses of Letrozole and Clomid. I conceived but miscarried at 17DPO. In 2019 we continued but this time skipped the oral meds and went to injectable meds. Failed in January, conceived in February but miscarried again. After this miscarriage and talking to him he knew I only had one vial of sperm left and we decided to head to IVF. I had my egg retrieval on Monday July 22nd 2019. 13 eggs retrieved, 6 fertilized, 4 made it to blastocyst stage and I am awaiting PGS testing. I cannot speak enough of Dr. Glassner. I know he has my best interest in mind and wants to keep me healthy during this entire time. I will forever be grateful to this man. Even though I am still awaiting my baby, I am hoping to have transfer this month August 2019, I know Michael will be able to make my dreams of becoming a mom a reality soon. Dr. Glassner if you are reading thank you from the bottom of my heart! I will forever be grateful for you!I switched to this clinic precisely because I was interested in a more personal approach.  Both Dr. Gocial and his staff always make me feel like they are treating my condition in a personal way.He seems to be very busy and doesn’t take as much time as I’d like to review my questions. He does seem to be reachable though when I request to speak with him All the staff at his office , including himself have always made me feel comfortable and cares about . They are there for me during each up and down. Although my husband and I primarily saw the nurses, Dr. Orris was always a phone call away if needed - even on his personal line. After my first failed embryo transfer, Dr. Orris was right on the phone not only explaining the next steps but checking in and providing support. Dr. Glassner and his staff are all very welcoming and empathetic to the reason why you are visiting their office. Everyone takes the time to make sure you understand every step of treatment and they are always willing to answer any question their patients have. During the process, I saw Dr. Brasile for my consultations, hysteroscopies, and egg retrievals.  Just the major stuff.  For all of my other (MANY) appointments I only saw the monitoring/care team, which I assume is the norm.  Most of the time I've had no idea who I'd be seeing, but I've loved every one of the girls more than the last, so it hasn't been a problem.  Just kind of feels like a ""take a number"" situation in the waiting room. Main Line Fertility is a busy clinic, so sometimes personal attention each visit was difficult, but anytime I needed questions answered or explanations, I was absolutely given the attention I needed. Dr. Glassner always remembers our last conversations and fertility plans despite the weeks between our meetings. We specifically sought him out after requesting a second opinion, and he remembered the details of our initial conversation, moreover after our consultation, he called the next day (unprompted) to make sure the information he provided sunk in, and to see if I had follow up questions. I was impressed by his attention and his memory of each patient case.A human Dr. Orris is always professional and friendly. He makes this hard process easier. My husband and I both enjoy our appointments.From our very first visit with Dr. Glassner and our first consultation we knew we picked the right doctor and fertility clinic. Dr. Glassner immediately made me feel like I was important and he cared about my treatment. He was as excited about me getting pregnant and having a baby as much as I was. He treated my wife and I with respect as an LGBTQ couple and knew exactly what reciprocal IVF was and how to go about doing it. His sense of humor put me at ease when I was nervous about my embryo transfers and I felt completely comfortable with him. After my first failed embryo transfer Dr. Glassner called me to discuss what happened and what our next steps were. During a devastating time of not getting pregnant, he put me at ease and made me feel optimistic again. I knew that my wife and I would reach our goal of having a baby with Dr. Glassner. When we got pregnant, Dr. Glassner was excited for us! He always made us feel that we were his most important patients. The attention given to every patient is unique and special at every consultation from the doctor and every staff member including the front desk, i will not go anywhere else hopefully will be able to conceive soonAlways felt VERY welcomed in the office from the time I walk in until I leave. All the Drs, Nurses, and PA's know my and my husbands name and treat us as if we are the most important or only ones there, even though there are a million other patients. Dr. Glassner even called to follow up after our first initial appt. And his PA, Rachel takes time in the office with me and over the phone to answer all of my 5,297 questions. Always made sure all of your questions were answered before leaving the room and made sure you understood the processes and procedures. Dr. Glassner took the time out to answer all my questions during our visits. He's personable and remembers past conversations that we had.  
Most importantly, Dr. Glassner knew our financial situation and was very flexible in trying to make IVF affordable for us. During our fertility process we found an amazing organization called the ""BabyQuest Foundation"".  BabyQuest provides financial help to people seeking fertility treatments. Because of Dr. Glassner's and Mainline fertility's understanding of our situation they provided fair pricing to the Foundation which in turn helped us win the grant. We will always be grateful and indebted to them.With Dr. Glassner, I always feel like I am treated as a human, and never a number. He doesn't rush the time spent with him, and always makes sure I don't leave confused. The office staff are always kind and also get to know you on a personal level very quickly. The staff and Dr.'s are the reason I continue to be a patient here. The office always feels like a revolving door no matter which location I go to. They barely have enough seats in the waiting room. I never really feel like I can spend any time asking questions. Dr Glassner was a perfect blend of honest, compassionate, and said he wouldn’t put us through anything he wouldn’t put his own daughter through and that is what always stayed with us month after month Dr. Orris has always been there for my treatment. He sees a lot of patients, but has never given up on me despite our lack of success at this point. I’ve had an ectopic pregnancy that resulted from my first IVF cycle and he was caring and didn’t look at that as a set back. His quick action saved my tube and hopefully my fertility. Dr. Orris truly cares. He cares about us, our story. He was excited with us when we graduate and devastated when we came back after a miscarriage at 16 weeks. He helped us with samples of medicine & even discounts on treatments. He has the biggest heart! There were times that I felt rushed and not able to express my concerns.  Other times, he would be very receptive and understanding of my situation.  Dr Glassner took time and consideration when discussing my case. Always made me feel welcome. And uses humor appropriately to ease fears Honest and open conversations. Talked about our likes and dislikes. Very friendly and open. All of us were Philadelphia fans and he even offered some Flyers tickets to us when he couldn’t attend Dr Glassner spent very little time with us. He often met with us for no more than 5-10 min at a time. When we had our miscarriage he escorted out of the back of the building. It was horrible. We just learned we had lost a child and he escorted us out the back door. It was the worst day of our lives and he showed such callousness.Dr Glassner got to know us, clearly explained our options, throughout our journey with him, helped us through my miscarriage and celebrated the births of our 2 daughters with us!Dr. Orris is very matter of fact, and there were a few times when I felt rushed. However, he always took the time to answer my questions and walk me through my options. When he could tell that I was stressed or worried, he would absolutely take the extra time with me. Dr. Glassner always puts his patients first. Although he may seem abrupt at times, he knows his patient's charts inside and out, sets realistic expectations for treatment, and is always available to answer phone calls and questions, no matter how small. He is very protective over his patients to the point that he doesn't want any other doctors to consult on their treatments, but because he wants to be sure that we are getting the best possible care.I originally went to a different clinic for my first 2 months of treatment but I was concerned that they weren't monitoring me very closely. I contacted Dr. Brasile for a second opinion. She met with me for over 45 minutes discussing my test results and initial treatment protocols. After several of her questions, I discovered my first clinic wasn't doing all of the 'checks'. It was very helpful that she took the time to get to know me, find out how aggressive we wanted to be about treatment, and clearly outlined next steps. The nurses in Dr. Gocial's office are very personable, friendly and caring. One of the nurses I recognized from my previous doctor's office and we talked about why she had wanted to work with Dr. Gocial. Dr. Glassner always referred to us by name. When we went back for our second, a year later, he remembered we owned a pizza shop and remembered that we had supplied lunch to his office. Details that I thought for sure he would have “forgotten” given the number of patients he sees on a day to day basis He answered all of our questions honestly - he didn't hesitate giving us answers we might not want, but he never sugarcoated or implied things were better than they were. When we had bad news, it seemed to upset and frustrate him as much as it upset and frustrated us. He also did a good job of trying to keep the scary stuff not so scary - he would make me laugh during transfers and IUIs and other invasive procedures go keep me calm.  I thought the nurses were phenomenal - really patient, kind, caring, took the time to explain, understood our circumstances (traveling from DC to Philadelphia for treatment), etc.I felt that Dr. Glassner and staff were very attentive, responsive and caring.  I felt rushed along though I felt like he cared about me in treatment and seemed like he really wanted me to get pregnant. However when we were struggling with whether to continue, he didn't listen to the emotional impacts it was having and the effect it was having. I also feel he was willing to overlook some significant medical problems I was having because I was in treatment. I was so desperate for a baby I looked away. Dr. Glassner is wonderful! He spent a lot of time with us twice in consultation. We never felt rushed. He was gentle, kind, funny, and understood my spiritual bent and offered his own stories with his kids. His staff are also WONDERFUL! They have all spent a lot of time with us in person and on the phone, letting me cry, talking through options, and answering our million questions! Plus, they have a large egg bank and embryos, which is unique. We had been to another doctor that had the opposite bedside manner and are so happy we found Dr. Glassner! We love this office! Dr. Brasille was always kind and compassionate. When we realized only 1 egg fertilized correctly she called me crying and feeling terrible. She said that my 1 embryo would get me pregnant, and it did. They barely remembered me each visit even though I saw them multiple times per week for 5 months. The doctor would only guess when we should have timed intercourse and the nurse mixed up my file with another woman. My doctor was not in the office when I did IUI and nobody ever followed up with me afterward. I decided to see a different doctor after that.I felt like it was a open/close door with him. He look at my file each time while we walked into his office. Gave us the plan and sent us on to the next patient.  He always makes sure that you understand what he means. He will break it down so that you feel secure in his care 110% of the time.Dr. Glassner, from the very first visit treated us like we were human and not a number. He answered all our questions before we even asked them and told us things that we had never been told before that could be causing our problems. Every visit he and  his staff are encouraging and compassionate. Everyone in that office knows me by sight. They remember me, are personable, and make every attempt to make me comfortable through this process.Dr. Glassner may be a bit rushed, as he has a busy practice.  But, he will sit with you and answer any questions you have.  He uses personal situations to compare with your own.  He is extremely compassionate.  He will leave it up to you as to what to do, though he gives you options and his opinionDr.Orris was always warm and inviting at every appointment. He didn’t just see me as another patient he had.Dr Glassner has a phenomenal bedside manner. His interactions with his patients is personal and genuine. He makes you feel like you are very important to him.Nurses at the clinic were very nice but often hurried.  I often saw Dr. Glassner's PA more than him but still felt cared for.Dr. Brasille is so confident and kind. She is friendly and always remembers me. Even though I switched to another doctor, she still remembers me and is excited for me. I talk to her when I run into her at the clinic and I always greeted with a hug.  the practice is extremely busy and ill be honest i felt like a number at times but i more felt like a human and that everyone who worked there cared about every paitent.
Dr Glassner and his staff answered all of my questions in a timely fashion. He always showed compassion but more so when he could see I was feeling down or defeated.Took time to try to explain treatments Dr. Gocial is patient, kind, and encouraging. From our very first meeting he was able to give us our diagnosis, which was never given to us at a previous doctor. He invited questions and made sure we felt comfortable with all the information we gave him. He is very matter of fact and wasn’t into being buddy-buddy but he was extremely knowledgeable. Dr. Glassner is the most amazing person! He’s caring, determined and he knows what he’s doing!Dr Glassner treats me as if i am his only patient. He always starts off each visit with a warm word! And will sit with me and explain everything to me! Him and his nurses are the bestDr Glassner treats his patients very kindly and treated my husband and I with a lot of respect and gave us a lot of confidence! Open honest and cared about us. Explained things and didn’t push us to do anything we were not ready for. I formed great relationships with the day to day nurses (Ivf), and have a good relationship w Dr Glassner. While I don’t seem him often, when I do I always feel as if I am his only patient and that he deeply cares that I get pregnant We were ushered from one waiting room to the next and was shocked when we saw the same nurse.  Everyone was incredibly friendly but they had a system down that moved everyone through as expediently as possible.The doctor focused mainly on the medical side of things and my treatment plan. The nurses were there to provide more of the human touch and encouragement. The doctor did hug me when I got pregnant though!He always sat down with us and talked through everything. I needed hand holding throughout the process and he really was there for us. Dr. Glassner is kind and everybody knows my name and is kind and patient.Dr. Glassner treats me as if I am his own daughter. He is kind and compassionate, but always tells it like it is. Always took the time for me and always honest good or badThe front desk and nursing staff is caring, but the doctor himself is brusque, hurried and insensitive. He took the time to explain to me what his thinking was. When I had a failed transfer and a chemical pregnancy that was not progressing, he called me to talk to me about it and reassure me that it wasn't my fault.Long wait times. Very quick visits. Like a cattle call sometimes. However there were also times when I would call very upset and he would phone me back. He is empathetic. Just very busy. He gets results. The nurses at Main Line Fertility are amazing. They are true professionals and extremely compassionate. You know they are rooting for you.Personable, honest, straight forward. Cares about your end Goal, empathetic, positive overall great guyEveryone was friendly and hopeful for my success. Everyone speaks to you like a friend and not just like a patient. Very professional attitude, nice and easy to talk toEntire process is based on what’s normal and usual for them. The nurses do all of the work and you barely talk to the doctor, maybe 10 minutes. During my IVF cycle, I only saw him in the OR for retrieval and for transfer. That’s it. I just felt like there were so many patients he didn’t even know who we were Dr. B is very warm and kind. She has a great “bedside manner”. The office is very busy sometimes and at some apts things did feel rushed. He always used my name and was nice, accommodating and pleasant to be aroundDr. Glassner has incredible bedside manner. He is compassionate when he needs to be, and funny when he needs to be. He spoke to me as me, not in medical terms. He remembers what is happening with my treatment and does what’s best. Extremely caring and willing to work with me",9.0,7.6999999999999975,"Dr Glassner is confident, is able to build rapport very quickly and explains the tests, treatments and plan very accurately without overwhelming us. He adopted a very masculine/""bro"" attitude toward my husband; maybe other men like that or feel it addresses their insecurity around infertility treatments but we thought it was weird. The second cycle when I came in shortly before ovulation, he informed me (rather than suggesting to me) that we were going to do an IUI. It is clear that he takes pride in his work and wants the absolute best case scenario possible for every patient. If you’re ok with a very direct doctor (there’s no sugar coating here) and one that can make you laugh, then he’s your guy!My experience with Dr. Orris has been better than expected. He could be very understanding and compassionate at times. He was always there for us for the key procedures and appointments. Dr. Glassner is straight forward and to the point. Dr. Glassner let me have a voice in all decisions related to my care. He knew I was excited and he set expectations for me saying IUI's usually don't work on the first try. The attention given to every patient is unique and special at every consultation from the doctor and every staff member including the front desk, i will not go anywhere else hopefully will be able to conceive soonAlways felt VERY welcomed in the office from the time I walk in until I leave. Other times, he would be very receptive and understanding of my situation."
71,Main Line Fertility  ,advice,"Dr. Glassner is an incredibly confident, capable doctor who really listens to what the patients' needs and goals.  He is energetic and upbeat, and though may seem blunt at times, I think he really cares about each patient.   I feel incredibly fortunate to be one of his patients.You're in great hands! Expect bluntness- he has no bedside manner. Expect to be your own advocate and ASK QUESTIONS. He will question why you have so many questions but otherwise you won’t get much out of him. She is very direct, which I appreciate.You can put your trust in Dr. Glassner, take a breath and know he will do the absolute best for youI would say, he is very respectful of your choices. However, it may be good to ask more for his opinion regarding next steps. I wish we would have moved to IVF sooner than we did. To trust dr glassner and he will be there always 100%Walk into every appointment with a list of questions and don't leave without answers.  Ask for everything to be explained and documented clearly.  And if it just doesn't feel right, speak up.  Don't be afraid to ask questions as everyone there is always happy to answer them.  You may not get to see him as often as you might a physician  at a smaller practice, but he has the experience and expertise for more difficult cases. It is worth your while to use Dr. Glassner. Ask to meet with him any time you have a question or want to make sure you’re on the same page as him and understanding the plan. Write down your questions ahead of time. As with any doctor, don't be afraid to ask questions and advocate for yourself.  Dr. Gocial will make it easy for you to do this but don't be too shy to ask questions, no matter how silly they may seem.Stand up for yourself and don't be afraid to ask questions.You are either going to love him,  LOVE HIM or hate him. Remember he is not the reason you can't get pregnant, please do not blame him. He's only there to help make YOUR dreams a reality! If these dreams don't come true immediately, remember your dreams will come true eventually, even if it takes years. HE IS YOUR ALLY, NOT YOUR ENEMY!Advocate for yourself, but try to place some trust in the care team as well.To demand how ever much time you need with him or ask him to slow down or repeat things if he’s talking too fast or you don’t understand something Be honest and open. He is a very intelligent doctor. Don’t be afraid to stop him and ask for a less “medical” explanation - he will gladly do so and make sure that everyone understands what is happening. Ask all the questions you want. Do not be afraid to voice your opinion or clarify something you do not understand. Ask a lot of questions. If you don’t ask, she doesn’t know you’re not clear on the process or terms and she’ll keep moving.  And don’t expect her to be at all, or even most, appointments.I would advise patients that he is blunt, but extremely knowledgeable and compassionate.  In general, i would advise any patient to be a self advocate, ask questions about anything  that makes you feel confused or hesitant. Be honest and direct with your needs. If you need to see him during an appointment, say so! He’s quite busy but will ALWAYS make time for you, you just have to ask.Trust him!Stick with him, even when it feels like things aren't working as fast as you want them to. Fertility treatments take time and Dr. Glassner will be there every step of the way to help you create that family that you want for yourself.  Be patientHave an idea in your head of what you might want to do first. Meaning... if you are ok with just a few meds combinied with IUI or if  you would like to do natural cycles. How comfortable you are with IUI and or IVF - be committed to your own path. Don't be afraid to ask as many questions as you want to make sure you understand what your treatment plan is and you feel comfortable and confident that you're receiving the best care possible for you and your partner. One piece advice I would give a new patient of Dr. Glassner is to be patient because the fertility process is long and can be stressful. One piece of advice would be, if you are looking for a Dr. to sugar coat your situation, he may not be for you. He is very down to earth and easy to talk to, but he is very straight forward about your situation and what is realistic with your expectations. She’s not the right doctor for a timid patient. She will not ask you if you have questions. I suppose she just assumes you already know what she’s talking about. Dr Glassner has a great sense of humor considering the nature of what he does and that worked for us.  It may not work for everyone but it’s what we needed.  At the same time he was always compassionate and shared in our frustrations in days when a sense of humor wasn’t appropriate. Make sure to ask the questions you have on your mind. He will always give his thoughts and plans for the cycle, but may not offer up all of the information you desire. Ask the questions and he’ll give you the answers. Trust him and trust his experience and don't be afraid to ask questions. He always listens and patiently answers.Ask questions if you don’t understand.  I have a science background and was familiar with a lot of what he spoke to us about but he can just talk and overwhelm you if you don’t have the background.  He is smart and driven and has a plan for everyone. It might not be what you want to hear but it is what will work. Don’t expect any sugar coating , just results Don’t be afraid to ask questions and be honest with where you are atDo your own research and ask questions. He is very charming and quickly won my husband and I over. Once we became a more difficult case instead of spending more time investing our case he told us what we wanted to hear to get more money. Try a cycle but if you are a complicated case get a second opinion early.If you are struggling with infertility, I highly recommend Dr. Glassner.I would say this with any doctor, but educate yourself on infertility and be your own advocate. If you have questions, make sure you ask them. If you don't understand something, make sure it's explained to you. Dr. Orris is incredibly smart and sometimes explains things in very technical terms that may be over your head. Simply ask him to back up and explain - which he'll gladly do.The clinic is busy, so make your appointments early in the morning.To ask questions. I think you need to ask all your doctors questions in this type of process. There are so many unknowns that it is helpful to get the answers from the expert and not a blog. As with any doctor, make sure you know what questions you want to ask and that they get answered. Ignore his bed side manner if it bothers you. He seriously is the best of the best. Ask any question that pops into your mind. He won't give more details than an overview if you don't ask questions, but he never has a problem being more specific when pressed.Ask for realistic time frames and expectations for possible scenarios; it's not like you just pay the money and magically get your baby.He is very to the point however, if your goal is to get pregnant, he is the person to go to.  I appreciated him being direct with me.He's flexible , willing to try new thingsBe honest with all of your hopes and fears - he will care for you well. She is direct, which I appreciated.  I would suggest seeking a second opinion if you feel something isn’t right. After just one consultation with a second doctor, we figured out two major things that Dr. Brasile failed to do.Ask all the questions you have, don’t feel rushed.
Trust him!Listen to what he had to say, It can be difficult to do all the tests and exams. He tries to make you as comfortable as possible, listen to him. He knows what he’s talking about.Be completely honest about how you are feeling. He will understand. Ask any and all questions. Don’t be afraid to ask the smallest one. He will be honest and tell you exactly what is going on.Don't feel rushed.  If you have questions, write them down before you go in, so you get everything answeredAsk questions if your unsure of anything! He is a very intelligent man and knows his stuff but will adjust to make you comfortable so make sure you ask about anything you don’t understand Be honest about your expectations. Ask questions and don't be afraid to be just as candid as he is.Make sure to get your questions in. Dr. Brasille is super friendly and sometimes you get talking so much and I would forget to ask what I needed to ask. Dont give up on him.  Let him do what he knows to see what is the best procedure for you.  He will let you know if its not possible.He is very busy, certainly tries to make time but be patient if you can’t see him every time.Trust himAsk lots of questions and don't rely that he will tell you on his own. Don't hesitate to ask questions- Dr. Gocial considers all your concerns and no question is too small.Ask questions, advocate for yourself. They only give you answers to the questions you ask. Come in with a list of what you want to know. Trust him, he knows what he is doing!!To just go to him! He is amazing!Bring questions to the initial consult and ask questions about next steps as you go alongHe is an amazing doctor. Trust in him and the nurses and you will be fine. They are miracle workers! Make sure to ask questions Trust him and his process Be prepared for bad jokes.Stick with it, it works and he knows what he is doing!Speak your mind and tell him what you want and need. He will listen. You have to have a sense of humor and be prepared for a straight shooter. He has a great sense of humor and is excellent at his job!How much he cares for his patients Spend as much time as possible with his PA, Rachel. She is kind, warm, compassionate and willing to spend time to explain things carefully.He can seem brusque sometimes, but he cares about his patients and doesn't waste your time.Don't get offendedJust do as he says. Be honest about your expectationsDon't dismiss the PGD testing. This was the key to the success of my IVF. It was an investment but it ended up saving us money as we only did one transfer with a perfect embryo.Always be open and honest about your intentions and goalsListen carefully -  he talks fast!Be ready with questions and write them down. He can be speedy when answering questions but don’t hesitate to ask him to slow down and repeat. Also be ready to have an idea of what route you would like to take (IUI, IVF, medications). On initial consult he presented me with a variety of options, percentages of success with each option and then asked me what road I would like to take.As of today, I wish doctor would point as soon as possible to the low count  problem,  without scheduling me for 2 surgeries removing polypsBeware of being pushed into pricy treatmentMaybe see the woman she’s nicer Think of questions ahead of time and be ready to ask away. Bring a good book, wait times can be long.Ask questions and be sure to be involved in the decision processHe truly knows what he is doing. He is aggressive, but his forward thinking is what got us results. Ask questions so you are comfortable and understand completely your individual protocol.Don’t be afraid to tell him what you’re feeling. He will work with you!

72,Main Line Fertility  ,nurse,"They are very patient and kind. They’ve seen it all, so when I first called and explained our story and lost it on the phone, they were more than compassionate and kind.Very caringI 100% loved the nursing team here. Niki, Maureen, Bridget really stood out to me and were extremely helpful during this process. They were very patient and always answered my questions with compassion and quickly! They also made me feel like I was always doing the right thing. Barb my nurse is an angel, she is responsible, returns calls, knows my treatment plan. Karen the front desk was always accommodating while making appointments I cannot say enough wonderful things about Brie.  She looked after me almost every visit; took my blood (painlessly I might add), and was always on hand for my questions.  Brie was the kind of nurse that you hope will be looking after you; she is so warm and sweet and is a pleasure to talk to and to get to see every week!The initial nurse I met with was informative and very helpful in obtaining my old records. All the nursing staff at Main Line Fertility have been incredibly patient and compassionate.  They make the whole process so much easy.  We always feel like they are rooting for us.  They listen to every concern and provide clear guidance.All of Dr. Gocial’s staff are amazing.  Very supportive and great communicators.  They go out of their way to help manage treatment and schedules.Maureen is the ABSOLUTE BEST. The rare times we had to see another nurse because Maureen wasn’t in, my husband and I were disappointed - all of the nurses were great, however, Maureen was the best! The whole staff is friendly and compassionate. They make the unpleasant experience of being in a fertility center as pleasant as possible. ExcellentI can not say enough about the nursing staff at Bryn Mawr. Bridget (sorry if it's spelled wrong!) Michelle, and the entire staff is one of the main reasons I continue with this practice. I don't know if I could have gotten through the bad times of fertility without these nurses. They take the time to get to know you and your journey becomes their journey. They are so invested in each and every patient that comes through their doors. The financial burdens and all of the emotions that come along with this process, the nurses are there for you every step of the way. They all go above and beyond for their patients. They are simply wonderful. Everyone i have ever encountered here has been amazing. from the front desk to the nurses and doctors. The nursing staff at MLF is absolutely incredible. They answered every one of my questions and always have a warm, positive and compassionate way about them. Every single phone call and in-person visit has been so pleasant and reassuring because of the AMAZING nurses at MLF. All the nurses in Gocial's office are excellent. I cannot say enough. Very kind, caring and personal. It's important because as a patient you will be meeting with the nurses for your appointments after a course of treatment is set. The nursing staff was wonderful. Absolutely wonderful. Caring, responsive, empathetic, just wonderful. At the appointments they were always welcoming and warm. I felt that my concerns were taken seriously. Every nurse at Mainline fertility shows an overflowing amount of love. Margie lie always so pleasant and understanding. Every time I was in her care she made me feel so much better.Seeing Allison was like seeing a friend every time I went in. She was so easy to talk to and even at times cry to! I can honestly say if I am to get pregnant I will miss seeing her She is so warm and kind! And always ready to listen and explain!they were all supportive and wonderful.",9.0,7.6999999999999975,"They’ve seen it all, so when I first called and explained our story and lost it on the phone, they were more than compassionate and kind. The whole staff is friendly and compassionate."
73,Main Line Fertility  ,clinic,"...the nurses are extremely empathetic. When I had a couple of cycles that resulted in negative tests, they - specially Margie - understood my pain and talked me through it. The time I was going to the clinic was very emotionally challenging for me, but it produced my twin boys via ivf and I really can't say enough positive things about the nurses and dr Glassner.They are really busy, -and you see different nurses, which can be annoying. I thought Glassner made up for that though. The clinic is very clean, organized, comfortable, easy to access.Bridget, Terri, Rachel, & Regina we’re amazing!The office and nurses were a well oiled machine that guided me well throughout my monitoring and IUI. Once my pregnancy was confirmed they were not as helpful, but think thats because I was on my way out of the office (into a regular ob/gyn)The women on the IVF team are some of the best women I have ever met.  Caring and compassionate, open and encouraging.  I could not have made it through infertility without their supportI just feel that they are all really good at their jobs - lots of knowledge and experience combined with compassion and reassurance. All of my questions were answers and my calls were returned promptly.The nursing staff has become family to me. It's very very large. They lost blood samples once. They also messed up an appointment and made us wait once. I much prefer the Paoli office to the Bryn Mawr office, but once you are doing IVF, you have to go to Bryn Mawr.Nursing staff is willing to answer my questions when I ask. Clinic has excellent communication and keeps you apprised of what is happening, takes emergency calls etcThey were patient and compassionate and incredibly knowledgeable.The nursing staff over the past few months have been so supportive.  They are excited each month to hear if we have good news to share, and when the positive test comes, they are elated.  During our current miscarriage, the nurses have helped us through each step of the way and have been incredibly compassionate and have helped us understand what is happening.  They are making this terrible situation bearable.IVF nursing staff in Bryn Mawr is amazing! I can say enough about how great they are. Nurses at Paoli and West Chester are also wonderful. One of our nurses was an angel throughout our journey. Very grateful for all these women.The nurses that I had met were nice and compassionate but also felt rushed at some points. The nursing staff has been absolutely amazing. They are organized and efficient. They greet every single patient with a smile, and are very understanding and compassionate. They keep us on track with appointments and reminders, and offer a friendly face while doing so.Each and every nurse is extremely kind and helpful.  If you have questions they will literally stop what that are doing and bring you into a consult room to re-review until you are completely comfortable.  Amazing team!They’re wonderful people and work well together. Patient and caring!! Makes all the difference for follow ups and while taking medicines and feel a little sick from the meds . They gave tips how to manage and breathe calmly through the process  I thought they were very friendly, kind, and good communicators.  But after my last appointment I struggled on the ""priming"" estrogen and when I stopped after 2 weeks of high-dose estrogen, it took a combination of at least 6 emails and phone calls over 2 days to get a progesterone prescription called in.  I felt fairly abandoned medically at that point.   Most were excellent and emphatic!It's nice that they have multiple locations, however, you should know that most of the doctors rotate between locations. I chose the clinic mostly for its location in Bryn Mawr, but then I found out that if I wanted to keep seeing my same doctor I had to travel occasionally to the West Chester and Paoli locations as well. The nurses also change locations so it's hard to get to know them.

The Bryn Mawr office has so many people working in it that it's kind of impersonal. Morning appointments feel like cattle calls and sometimes they get backed up and waits can be long. I waited over an hour one time just for a blood draw.

Maybe they are good if you are experiencing some forms of infertility, but I found them on the whole pretty insensitive about recurrent miscarriage. Everyone, doctors and nurses, was always saying, ""Don't worry, we'll get you pregnant."" For a lot of people, that's not the problem and it made me feel like they weren't paying attention to me as a person--or, more importantly, to me as a patient with a particular medical history.

If you are willing to walk five minutes at the Bryn Mawr office, you can get free street parking.

I wish they had electronic medical records and some sort of patient portal where we could log in and see our test results. With these huge paper files, it feels like a different decade. Also, sometimes they would forget to forward my file to the appropriate office where my appointment was on a particular day.
Best people you will ever meet. Caring, friendly, funny. They are there to help you also! Very compassionate but over worked. I can’t say enough about the nurses at Mainline Fertility . They are so caring and compassionate. They cheer with you, cry with you, make you feel special. They nursing team has planned a major role in my love for the clinic. The nursing staff is absolutely amazing! They are very caring and are sure to make you feel at ease each and every time you visit. The nursing staff is the best! They are friendly, kind, compassionate, hopeful, positive people! There were multiple times I went in for an appointment and was just sad or not 100%, but the ladies always made me feel better, mostly just by being the smiley bubbly wonderful humans they are. The check out lady..not so much. All of the nursing staff was compassionate, answered any questions regarding procedures, and gave me a full explanation of what to expect with each procedure / visit. The nursing staff are very compassionate and patient to answer all of your questions. I was nervous at first to be without a nurse coordinator, but I made a point to really get to know the nurses so they knew me as a patient. They have been very supportive and feel like extended family during this process.They are so friendly at mainline. I never dread my appointments. And they are the best at drawing blood. I usually bruise very bad. The nursing staff at Main Line Fertility was amazing. They are the glue that holds the clinic together and kept me sane during my fertility treatment. They are extremely knowledgable in all this fertility and are there to answer questions, ease your nerves, and keep you positive. They were there for me every step of the way. During my failed transfer, the nurses comforted me and when my transfer worked they rejoiced with me. They knew exactly who I was, who my wife was, and our goal. I am forever grateful for every nurse that was involved with my care during my fertility treatment. Amazing ! That is really the only word needed. Via phone and in the office there were always super compassionate and caring. Compassionate and knowledgeable. The nurses were nothing short of excellent. They calmed our nerves and literally held my hand throughout the process. They always explained any procedure that I had a question about. They were caring and compassionate. The staff is very kind and warm but they almost never know why I am in that day. I came in with sperm for my first IUI and the nurse thought I was there for more monitoring. The nurses were so compassionate and would always try their best to keep you motivated throughout the process.  Our insurance converge is horrible for fertility so the nurses always tried to help us out by giving us donated meds if they were available to try to eliminate some of the financial stress that comes with this process Every nurse at Main Line Fertility is wonderful. They are caring, knowledgeable, and always keep me informed of my medical care. They are optimistic, excited when things go well and are sad with me when things go wrong. I couldn’t ask for a better nursing team. I honestly believe that MLF has the best nurses & support team around. The 3rd party coordinator team - an amazing team of women who will pretty much go out of their way to help you get what you need and simplify the process as much as they can. The monitoring team who is a group of the most compassionate, caring, generous women who take the time to get to know you, feel the pain with you and be excited with you. These women are the true heros...they are so organized and coordinate the schedule of meds and even help with free samples to help with the cost of treatment. I don't have enough words to describe them but they truly treat you like family and I love each & every one of them for that. I went through such a hell of a time and they have been so wonderful to me. Every time I was through the doors I get warm hugs and know that I am being taken care of.There were 3 nurses on the monitoring team that were amazing.  One in particular went out of her way to talk to Dr. Glassner for me on my treatment plan and ask about financial assistance.  The procedure team nurses were also great.  The doctor’s side where I had to go for OHSS were not as pleasant.  All were very friendly and helpful. Never had an issue and would let us look at the sperm under microscope to better understand motility and count. Very professional and kind The nursing team is the only reason we continued to stay with this office through our failed cycles. They were kind when we miscarried. They communicated with us through our every step of the way. When I had a question it was the nursing staff that got us an answer from Dr. Glassner. They shared in our happiness, our frustration and our sadness. The nursing staff at Mainline were the ray of light in what has been an incredibly hard journey.The nursing staff was excellent from start to finish of every appointment. They were genuine and talked me through what they were doing and why during ultrasounds, blood draws, etc.The nursing staff at Main Line Fertility are AMAZING. They are warm, compassionate, funny, and self-depreciating enough to make you feel comfortable when you're laying on an exam table for a cervical exam. They are always available to answer questions, return phone calls quickly, and explain every test and benchmark thoroughly.The nursing staff is always very friendly and willing to answer questions. They return voicemails promptly and always call by the afternoon with the results. I never had a bad experience with a nurse at his office. We had one poor experience with an ultrasound tech but otherwise everyone was helpful, understanding, compassionate. They were all patient, willing to answer my questions, and were so nice during what is obviously a very stressful time. The nurses were amazing - so patient, caring, kind, steady, etc.Kind even when i was actively losing a pregnancyThey are all wonderful! They are friendly and warm and spend as much time as you need to cry, talk, and ask questions. The nurses and ultrasound tech were always very nice. Nurses were with me every step away, through the good and bad. Hugs when I needed them. Hope was I was hopeless. Happy/Sad Tears with me. They are the best nurses.All of the nurses are so compassionate, encouraging and caring. They take the time to listen and encouraging and are just as heartbroken when you have a negative test as you are I love the nursing staff! They are compassionate, personable women that helped me feel comfortable through every step of the process.The practice is extremely busy, but there are IVF nurses, retrieval nurses, office visit nurses, etc.  All of the nurses are very sweet and kind and try to be optimistic.The entire staff is comforting and experienced. Every visit I was made to feel important and comfortable. They treat you with care and share in your disappointments and Joy's.  The nurses under Dr. Brasille are so friendly, knowledgeable and understanding. They are extremely nice, caring and friendly.  They talk you through everystep and answer any questions you have.The office is pretty packed, and while they have the rule of no kids in the room, people would bring in their children, which for someone without any is really tough. Not the clinics fault, as I know this is hard to reinforce. Also the room is pretty crowded and you may wait for a routine visit.Very caring and would get back to you in a very timely mannerThey were very thorough in explaining blood work results,  medications,  and procedures. Super clean. Relatively short wait for the initial appointment,  within less than 1 week of my call. Other doctors would have made us wait over a month. Possiblity of joining a clinical trial is encouraging. Mainline is the only fertility clinic in Philadelphia with the approval for clinical trials. Convenient appointment times before work They were always very friendly. Sometimes I felt like it was chaotic with a lot to keep straight. Pros: Dedicated, smart, caring clinic. Always had appointments, short wait times, great bedside manner, good communication, payment options/discounts available, helped with medications when needed. I could go on forever!

Cons: I wish we could see our charts and communicate online! Very well organized office and staff- all have specialized jobs and practiced hand offs throughout the process.  Very friendly and welcoming nurses, all staff was open to the different ways people decide to become parentsThis clinic is amazing. Everything about going here made me feel good and welcome. I never second guessed my decisions and I always believed in the staff. They were very professional as well and always acted very caring.  There could not be a better staff. So many have gotten me on this journey so they are very sympathetic to what you are going through Many patients and it is run like a tight ship. You are in and out quickly. Which is good and bad.  They always take extra time if you need it or ask for it. And are always open.   All of the employees and doctors that I have been with at the practice are exceptional.  The nurses were great.  The team for third party reproduction were not.  They are incredibly disorganized and just shy of unprofessional.  When we started to discuss egg donation, we made it clear our main concern was health and height - not that she look like me.  The team couldn't understand that and sorted for us based on my characteristics. When we lost our first baby I just brusted into tears and the nurse just held me and let me cry. Kind and compassionate and personable. Patient and thorough. The doctors at the office are very thorough. The nurses and staff are very kind and compassionate. They have empathy. I have been there several times when finding out i miscarried and they cried along with me. The office is well run and they keep appointments running close to on time. All the nursing staff was wonderful! So caring and loving Good reputation
Good location
Long wait times can be frustrating
Busy office can make you feel like a number
Sometimes office staff can be less helpful or forget you haven't done this before and you're anxious.They are the best. They ran that place. You saw them all the time. Do compassionate. Most of the staff was amazing. There was one or two who I didn't care for. But as humans we can't like everyoneThe nursing staff was very friendly. They always have a smile on their face.Over all nurses are sweet. But I wish they would be more straight to the point explaining me possible painful reaction during polyp removal. My second surgery was unbearably painful. I took Tylenol, which is useless in this situation. They clearly don't say how bad it could be. No wonder people prefer anastasia. But nobody offered me anything like that.Nursing staff is so used to what they do every day. They’ll call and say “your labs are all good” without giving specific numbers. They know the doctors protocols so they just follow them. They didn’t tell me potential side effects of medications (estrace made me CRAZY and no one told me this before I started taking it)They were mostly okay but I found some of them in the west Chester office short and uncompassionate. They just weren’t very caring. I liked the Bryan mawr staff better They are very nice and personable. They really know their stuff. But again, sometimes apts feel rushed since there are so many patients to seeVery friendly, and able to answer any additional questions that I hadSweet angels who were always compassionate and helpfulThe best of the best. Infertility is the worst, but when you walk in you feel like family and know everyone is on your team This is a beautiful clinic, the facility is brand new and very professional.  The receptionists are fantastic, I always feel welcomed and it seems like they always know who the clients are.  There are always appointments available at convenient times.  It's already very difficult going through testing, monitoring appointments and now recheck appointments, let alone balancing them with work schedules.  This clinic is so accommodating and really understands the stress that couples go through during this process, and they make every effort to make it as easy as possible.Strengths 
-convenient locations in the PHL area
-90% of nurses and ultrasound techs are wonderful and make your experience so much better
-very clean environment 

Weakness
- they do not offer a bundle for IVF payment and after multiple rounds it is VERY expensive 
Strength is definitely communication. Reception was always willing to answer questions and help out. You could get in for diagnostics and consults relatively fast. I would not recommend this place for anyone who doesn’t know infertility yet, only someone willing to be their own advocate. I feel Dr. El-Roiey lacks compassion and is so used to people just agreeing to IVF he doesn’t see the need to do other testing or procedures, and if you can’t afford that or don’t agree with him than he is uninterested in helping you. The clinic is always organized and clean. The appointments are usually on time, and everyone is taken care of. I have never felt rushed, or delayed. They are very good at making sure you don't have any unanswered questions or concerns before leaving also. You will be very impressed with this clinic, they are helpful and on top of EVERYTHING!  You can relax and know they will take care of you from consult, medications, insurance (which is a HUGE pain), financials.... the list goes on... I really cannot even imagine how difficult it could have been if hadn't left our prior clinic, Penn.  Main Line Fertility is AMAZING!I think fertility is grueling to go through. The doctor/clinic could be hopeful yet also warn regarding how terrible it could be too. The doctor is always positive. But, I think it may be beneficial to hear some of the bad news too
I feel I honestly never saw any weaknesses in my journey with them so far. I feel all was done in a way it should be in a timely fashion. I feel the strengths are good communication , understanding and compassionate. I believe that patients need to go in honest and give it there all, and the drs and nurses in return will be there 100%. It is hard to sometimes open up altogether and be totally you in this hard journey of infertility but the more open and honest you are with yourself and the drs I think the more they can help you! Front office staff were friendly and it was relatively easy to schedule appointments.  They have several locations so there's some flexibility in where to go.  I probably would not use them for outside monitoring as their notes are all handwritten and not necessarily clear and complete for others to review and make decisions based on.  I don't have the impression that they're a referral clinic you would go to for any especially complicated situation.  Also, the fees were not explained clearly or in any detail up front, so there were some surprises there later.  MLF set the bar high for my expectations for OB/GYN care.  In fact, I quite wish they were my OB/GYN!  I am so thankful and feel so lucky to have been entrusted into their care.  They did everything they could to explain everything I needed to do and follow up with me when it should have been done.  They take great care of their patients and I cannot say enough about our experience there.This is a busy clinic. Pros-they are flexible with their hours and you can pretty much pick your appointment time between 0700-1100. Cons-there are often long waits at the appointments. Average is an hour, but it Wasn’t unusual for it to take almost 2 hours. MLF is an excellent clinic. The doctors are knowledgeable about the latest science in reproductive health, very good at their work (procedures), and confident leaders. Nurses are on the same page and supportive to each doctor and patient. My only negative is that they are so good/busy that it can be a long wait. When I first came to MLF I was worried it would feel like a factory. After being there for a few months I realize that worry was eliminated within 2 visits. I feel like part of their family and am warmly greeted by nurses/phlebotomist multiple times each visit. Overall, I have been more than satisfied at Main Line Fertility and highly recommend it to anyone. The clinic's strength is its staff.  From receptionists to nurses to doctors, you feel like you have the best team in your corner.  85% of the time someone is at the end of a phone to answer your question and those few times the nurses are busy, they return your call quickly.Fast, efficient, everyone treats you as family. I never feel as though I'm a number! After the first couple visits they (the front desk) knew my name! They do anything and everything to help make your experience the best possible! Nurses learned about how to get my blood within a few visits (I'm a tough stick). Ultrasound technicians are amazing. I have a tough right ovary that is hard to find, but they always are as gentle as possible and apologize for any discomfort I may be experiencing! LOVE EVERY ONE OF THESE PEOPLE IN THIS OFFICE!The center city office is great because it’s very small.  This gives you a much more personalized feel which is why I moved my care here from another larger clinic.  For weekend treatments you should be prepared to travel to The Bryn Mawr facility.
They are extremely busy and the wait times for your appts are insane.. always an hour plus wait. I also can usually overhear other patients discussions with staff so they should go behind a closed door to talk about medical history.  The nurses are very nice thoughStrengths:
Very personable 
Flexible scheduling 
Treated as an individual, not a number 
Very transparent with options and prices 
Offers financial assistance 
Entire team is awesome 
I don’t have any weaknesses to comment on. My experience has been a good one. I went to another clinic prior and didn’t go for more than three visits . This was due to poor customer service . Mainline Fertility and Dr. Gocial have exceeded my expectations. Strengths - great atmosphere, you feel like family not just a patient, they will go above and beyond for anything you need. 
Weaknesses - none to date. 

I would recommend this clinic to my family and friends in a heartbeat. The strengths are the short wait times, the great attitudes of the staff, the willingness everyone has to help the patients...their goal is the same as the patients, to get the patient pregnant! I think the only weakness the office has is the time restrictions for appointments. They dont really have appointments past 2:30pm which makes it difficult when you work. The strengths are in the Dr.s and the monitoring team. I love them! Really love them! I somehow leave every blood and ultrasound appointment hopeful and smiling. However, the downside is as bad as the upside is good. Billing is a nightmare. To the point that they’ve stressed me out so bad with incorrect (and surprise) bills, to the tune of $18,000, that I’m considering delaying my embryo transfer. The stress is just not healthy and could diminish my odds. All of the humanity and care is gone once money is involved. This goes for the checkout woman, cold, rude, and quick to dismiss you, right up to the billing department. Somehow after every encounter with them, they make us feel like we’re the very first people to go through IVF and the insurance process with them. It is awful! The same conversations over and over again, using cash we gave them for one thing to pay for things they were supposed to submit to insurance, and just plain impossible to deal with. The process of IVF is hard..the hardest, most emotionally and financially stressful thing most people ever have to go through..this is lost on anyone at mainline who deals with money. I will say that at the beginning of this process, i was terrified, scared to death..of needles, hormones, surgeries, all of it. I got through that part, proved my strength to myself and got past it. The billing process and people were the only thing that has sparked  the slightest thought of quitting. I cried more because of their stress than any part of the actual medical process. So unless you are paying cash, or have hours upon hours upon hours to spend going between insurance companies and the mainline billing department...well, just be sure to check our more than one place’s reviews. The good and the bad. The billing department is the reason I’m looking into another clinic in NY for any future treatment if needed. The clinic's strengths include a highly organized team of knowledgeable individuals who are aware of your history and plan of care.  All nurses and doctors are compassionate and assist you in understanding all procedures, risks, and rationales for treatments.  One weakness I would cite is simply the busy nature of the clinic, which does not allow itself to give you personal attention and quality time with each visit.  Due to the business of the clinic, it is important for you to be well informed and to be an advocate for yourself and ask questions / facilitate conversations.    The clinic does a great job of working with a lot of patients and once and separating the patients based on treatment plan (eg: IVF patients have their own set of nursing staff from those seeking other fertility treatment plans.) at first, it was frustrating that I didn’t have one person to call and that knew my case, now that I’m well into my first IVF cycle, and I’ve spent more time at MLF, the office staff and nursing staff know me and remember my journey. They do a great job of easing your fears, but don’t be bashful about asking questions! Often times, if you don’t ask what’s next, the team will assume you know. Their strengths are that they always are on time and prepared. Always friendly and take the time to answer me. I don't really think they have weaknesses. Only thing I'd change is a closer office to my home.Main Line Fertility is clean, welcoming, thorough, knowledgeable, and overall fantastic. The staff is great from the front desk to the nurses to the doctors. They are knowledgeable and welcoming the LGBTQ patients and are able to provide a variety of different treatments to help create families. The staff makes you feel important and never like just another patient. Fertility treatments can be scary and stressful, but the clinic does everything to keep you informed, calm, and optimistic about achieving your goals. Excellent hours as early as 7am excellent for working women, everthing is done on site Ultrasounds, labs, surgeries at Bryn Mawr hospital across the street. Every employee is friendly compassionate and understanding, family oriented. They treat you as a human not just another number. That is important for any person as a patient. Strengths would be the way they are organized, make you feel comfortable and at home. Really the only negative I'd say is to have a little more room in some of the waiting rooms -- sometimes there are not enough seats. 100% recommend this clinic and would not go anywhere else. The doctors are all extremely well educated, knowledgeable, and communicate well when you meet with them. Sometimes the clinic felt very crowded and impersonal, but the staff is so friendly and tries to make your experience the best possible. Strengths: professionalism, bedside manner, there is always a person to answer your calls, honesty, they were great at building confidence, flexible hours

Weakness: On rare occasions the wait could be more than 15 minutes.So when you there for your consult on the ""Dr."" side, expect a wait!! This is my least favorite part about the clinic. On their busier days you can expect to be there for at least an hour and a half. I found this troubling, because when you are pregnant and transferred to this side, you already take so much time off of work with the IVF process and having to come for weekly appointments or even biweekly, i noticed I had to take almost half days to attend my appts here. Another down side is if the pregnancy isn't going as planned, these long wait times I found extremely hard, as the last place I wanted to be was in public sitting in a room with a bunch of strangers. 

On the flip side, the staff is great. The women at the front desk get to know you, they are kind and always smiling. They have a lot of locations which can make things a bit more  convenient but the hours are not the best. They don’t open until 8am even for bloodwork. I am always late for work after an appointment. It feels like a revolving door at times. The clinic is amazing but just like any other dr office you have to be your own self advocate and make sure to always call with any questions.  They are always there to help and the more you ask the more comfortable you will be.  They have everyone’s best interest in mind so don’t hesitate to rely on them throughout the process The clinic is wonderfully staffed, they work with my crazy work schedule, always get my scripts ordered and also work with us financially. The only weakness that I have found is that I haven’t ever been told the grading of my embryos. The only weakness of the clinic is wait time which can be longer than usual at times. However, when you are the patient they are treating it is nice to know that neither Dr. Orris, the techs or nurses are rushing you through the consult or appointment and that you are getting their full attention.If going for IVF the monitoring and procedure team nurses are amazing.  They are what made me keep trying and were always encouraging.  The front desk staff was mostly nice.  The financial coordinator was available for any questions.  You will rely mainly on the monitoring team nurses if going through IVF.  excellent staff and physicians. Like a lot of doctors offices waiting times can increase but most days I was in and out on time. everyone is happy and smiling and it has a family feel to it. they remember every patient. great encouragement from staff and support during tough times Strength would be the professionalism and kindness.
Weakness would be how slow things would take. Waiting rooms would be packed and you would wait for awhile. It can be hard I guess with so many different patients and scheduling around cycles but it was very rare when we didn’t have to wait for a long time. Would be nice to have a better system.The strength of the clinic is by far the nursing staff and the women who run clinical trials. Be persistent with Dr Glassner speak up for yourself and don’t let him hurry you through your appointment. It is easy to rely on the nurses because they are so competent. But remember he is your doctor.  I also found it helpful to take notes during our meetings. Main Line Fertility has multiple locations which allowed me flexibility to schedule appointments at times and locations that were best for me. Everyone I interacted with by phone and in person was friendly and helpful.MLF is a great clinic - top rated doctors, knowledgeable and friendly nurses and staff, clean space, associated with Bryn Mawr Hospital, etc. Typically I am seen within 20 minutes of my scheduled appointment time - I've only had to wait longer a few times, which I think is impressive. They work to make sure you can get in and out of the appointments (since often you're there a few times a week!).It can be very busy and it can take a long time to see the Dr. and make it through all the waiting rooms.This clinic is extremely busy. They typically run on time but can get backed up by 15-20 minutes early in the morning. Overall, I don't have to wait long but it can be frustrating to see so many women booked at the same time. Dr. Gocial's Main Line Fertility office in Center City is very small.  So it's less private in a sense. There are only a few people you will be interacting with. But that's not always a bad thing. You're not likely to have an appointment with someone you haven't met before. Any IUI or IVF appointments will happen at Bryn Mawr. That's a larger office, but I found the culture to be very much the same. Everyone is friendly and make an effort to make you feel comfortable. Everyone (except one ultrasound tech) from the office to the front desk to the nursing staff and doctors and PA were amazing. They made the process a little less nerve wracking. I felt like they were my family during my time there. I did monitoring at Shady Grove in Washington, DC.  Main Line helped to arrange this.The clinic is in a great location and because there is a large number of staff, I never had to wait long for blood draws etc.  They were always helpful and understanding.  It is a very busy practice and there were times when I ran into people i knew there.  Most of us were doing it in secret so that was a little awkward.    I have no complaints.The office is friendly, modern, bright and well coordinated so that you move through each visit in an organized way. Everyone there is SO nice. They are always willing to talk and hear you. Our first visit had a long wait, but once we saw that 4 different people were willing to spend AS MUCH time with them as we needed and wanted, we didn’t care about the wait because we’d rather have this personalized  care. They have multiple locations and great hours. I felt that I could get to work on time, and I didnt wait long for my visits. The front desk staff was very friendly, Nicole was always super helpful. When we were thinking of doing a clinical trial they coordinator tried her hardest to get us in, and then I was pregnant so it wasn’t needed. They are always very busy. Wait times can be long, even early in the morning. The nurses are very nice but don’t expect to see your doctor after every visit. Even when you need to discuss a plan for the following month.Getting an early appointment is tough. 
Nurse’s are great and really get to know you.
Receptionist try their best to get you the appointment time you want.
Don’t expect to spend a lot of time with the doctors.
Plan for a 2 hour visit, although sometimes they are quickThey are overflowing with strengths. They show compassion and love to every one of their patients. In my experience you never feel like a number, you are treated with understanding and they try the best to their ability to help in any way they can.The information the staff give you can sometimes be a little overwhelming but you can call and email any questions you have at anytime. Each person I’ve talked to have been just as encouraging as the nursing staff. This clinic is kind, compassionate and caring. For the amount of patients always waiting to see the doctors, they know who you are, and don’t make you feel rushed through the process. Their approach is positive yet sensitive to your situation.It is a very nice, new clinic.  The waiting room can be very busy.  Parking is a hassle, though there is a parking garage right there, it is usually packed.  State of the art technology.  They have water/coffee/tea in the waiting room for everyone
Everyone at every office is kind and patient! And let me tell you, they are a busy office! They get to know you very well and share a special bond with you! I can not say enough good things about all of them! Initial communication about what I needed to do to start off my second cycle was a mixed up. But the staff caught  the oversight and it did not affect my start date. So perhaps they could assign a staff member to follow individual patients from cycle start to finish.  Strengths: Responsive, compassionate staff, well regarded, team will try everything they can do to help you achieve your desired outcome.

Weaknesses: You feel rushed, not enough 1 on 1 with doctor, not enough early morning appointments for working patients.Main Line Fertility West Cheater is a smaller clinic than their main office in Bryn Mawr, however, the treatment is still excellent. The staff is caring, gets back to me in a omelet manner and truly knows me. Be prepared to wait.  The practice is busy but when it is your turn you will get every second and attention of thr doctors and staff.  You will not leave without your questions answered and if you do you can call them for help.The clinic took an individualized approach. It is a very busy practice which makes it hard. I felt more at ease there than at my previous. I didn't feel like I was left to fend for myself which is a priority I feel in IVF. I felt like they were the experts and was in good handsI love that there a several locations.  However,  not all locations seem to have the same quality of care.  Bryn Mawr had the best nurses,  but was also the busiest and the parking was less then ideal as you can expect to pay around $5 a visit just to park. There is no public parking you are forced to use the parking garage.  When you go a couple times a week it really adds up.Having multiple doctors means the scheduling is easier but that you may not always be with your doctor. Sometimes there is a long wait if you don’t get in first thing in the morning. They are really good at responding to emails and phone calls. Convenient times/days, fast appts, short waits, results called by 2pm. Nurses did majority of the visit, but Dr. was always available if I needed to talk to him. They r very organized!! My appointments are always on time. Max time i have needed to wait was 5 min. The secretaries are all sweet and kind!  The clinic is also really clean and a nice environment! I totally recommend this place to everyone!Very good at calling back. Good communicator. But make sure to stay on top of your bill. They switched systems in the middle of us getting treated and it was a little
Crazy to understand. They are good at scheduling when you need to be there and work around you work schedule Strength - they get the job done.
Weakness - the number of patients and the wait.  you truly feel like a number.  at times, we were confused as to where we were and what we were doing there.  no one explains once you are pregnant, you move the other side of the office.  Appointment in the morning are hard to come by. It is crowded but runs well. If getting your blood drawn make sure you drink a lot of water ahead of time. You are going to wait every time but it is worth the wait. Dr. Glass net will meet with you if you request it. Sometimes I feel rushed by the ladies who answer the phone. Otherwise, they are prompt and the clinic is clean and everyone is kind. They are well organized and move people through. They are private. It is like a well oiled machine. I never had any complaints with anyone or anything. Everyone was wonderful at every visit. Just be prepared and go in with a open mind and bring a pen and paper to write everything down. Lots of info to try to remember. everyone there was compassionate and helpful. the only thing I didn't like was the sappy-sweet inspiration signs on the walls, like ""not yet in my arms, already in my heart"" - those kinds of signs don't help me feel any better about having to undergo fertility treatments.Work with you for payment terms, easy to talk to on the phone, fairly quick appointments usually. Give back if donations are given Strengths: Your doctor will see you directly at almost every appointment. Another strength is that the staff are very involved in helping you navigate and understand your insurance coverage.
Weakness: Because your doctor will see you directly wait times can be somewhat long, i.e. One hour for baseline ultrasound, bloodwork and talking with doctor.Convenient location,  schedule, facility.
But I was so depressed for several weeks that this pain was so sharp during polyp surgery, and I had a panic attack because I was holding on until surgery was finished. If now any doctor would try to convince me that I have to do the same procedure in order to get pregnant, I would refuse.I think that dr orris really pushes I’vf. The clinic is big and it’s hard not to feel like a number. They don’t really give you too much personal attention or compassion and kind of don’t explain things fully in the beginning Main Line Fertility has several locations but not all are open each day of the week. This means some apts on some days I have to travel over an hour to an open clinic. Wait times can be long, the office is usually busy and things can feel rushed.The office is very well Organized. All the staff there is Friendly and they Communicate well! The only thing I'd say was the girl who did blood draws didn't seem to be able to do it well. It always hurt and more often than not she couldn't find the vein and would go through both arms and wiggling it around. But no one else has ever had trouble finding it for me. But she is very sweet and I'm grateful to be a patient at MLF in readingThe clinic is clean, compassionate, knowledgeable, and conveniently located. The entire staff is sensitive and sympathetic to the sensitive situations you are going trough.

Sometimes I would wait quite a while to be seen, this is the area they could improve.Mainline Fertility is the best. You just need to remember you are frustrated at the situation, not the people who are doing everything to help you. If you stay positive, this clinic will bring your babies to life Efficient well oiled machine.  You are called back for blood work (super quick and easy), then you wait in a small waiting room (usually very brief), brought into private room for ultra sound, nurse discussion.  If Dr. wants to see you you would then see them, or could request to see them.  They call you around 3 pm that day with any results from blood-work or adjustments to be made to medications or protocol. Some days these appointments went quickly and smoothly while other days they took a while and you were ushered from one waiting area to the next. It really depended on how busy the clinic was.Monitoring was run as best as possible. Waiting was to be expected and truthfully I never mind to wait for this doctor. I actually find my appointments relaxing and nonstressful.I’m a nurse and I work overnight . I was always told long as I was there before 10:45am. So, I would say very flexible . Ran like a well oiled machine. Monitoring appointments are done in the morning which worked great for me as i could go before work. I always had a morning appointment and I was in and out quickly. I don’t remember any specific days that there was a backup. ",9.0,7.6999999999999975,"When I had a couple of cycles that resulted in negative tests, they - specially Margie - understood my pain and talked me through it. Most were excellent and emphatic!It's nice that they have multiple locations, however, you should know that most of the doctors rotate between locations. They are extremely knowledgable in all this fertility and are there to answer questions, ease your nerves, and keep you positive. The nursing staff is always very friendly and willing to answer questions. Strengths 
-convenient locations in the PHL area
-90% of nurses and ultrasound techs are wonderful and make your experience so much better
-very clean environment 

Weakness
- they do not offer a bundle for IVF payment and after multiple rounds it is VERY expensive 
Strength is definitely communication. I have a tough right ovary that is hard to find, but they always are as gentle as possible and apologize for any discomfort I may be experiencing! It is easy to rely on the nurses because they are so competent. In my experience you never feel like a number, you are treated with understanding and they try the best to their ability to help in any way they can. I didn't feel like I was left to fend for myself which is a priority I feel in IVF."
74,Main Line Fertility  ,protocol,"Dr. Glassner was very honest with our situation, and since he was the second RE we visited, he provided an active approach with statistics and realistic expectations.I had elevated prolactin, which was managed with a month of medication prior to my IUI. Once those levels were normal I was cleared to take letrozole days 3-7 of my cycle, with an ultrasound on day 7. I used the trigger shot day 9 and had the Iui day11.Because of our previous miscarriages, we knew we could get pregnant, but we were concerned of the quality of the eggs.  We were also worried that we were getting older, so the odds of miscarriage was only going to increase.  Initially we said that IVF was off the table and that if we had another miscarriage, we were going to stop trying.  Dr. Glassner agreed that we could just try medications like Clomid and Femara to help us get pregnant again faster and hope that the pregnancy would be successful.  We used just clomid for 4 cycles with no luck.  We then moved to clomid and femara with IUI and were able to get pregnant on our 2nd cycle.  We saw a gestational sac initially, but a week later there was nothing in the uterus but a probable ectopic pregnancy was found on my ovary.  We discussed options, including surgery to diagnose exactly what was going on, but Dr. Glassner was able to help with non-invasive treatment.  Even though we are devastated to lose another pregnancy, Dr. Glassner's support and confidence helped us make the decision to move forward.  We have our first IVF orientation next week and will look into pre-implantation genetic testing to help us get the best results possible.1. First cycle I was on clomid. Ovulated 3 eggs. Was told when I was ovulating via ultrasound and bloodwoork. Took Crinone until negative pregnancy test.
2. Second cycle took clomid and letrozole. Ovulated 2 eggs. Negative postcoital test. Did IUI based on ovulation monitored by bloodwork and ultrasound. Took Crinone. Negative pregnancy test.
3. This cycle took clomid and letrozole. Ovulated 1 egg based on blood work and ultrasound monitoring. Took Crinone until negative pregnancy test. 
4. Fourth cycle took injections. Clomid, Gonal f, cetrotide, and trigger shot. Ovulated approximately 5 eggs. Did IUI based on ultrasound and blood work. Took Crinone until negative pregnancy test. 
5. Took 1 month off
6. This month just took Letrozole in anticipation of possibility of IVF the following month. Monitoring of ultrasound and blood work. Ovulated 1egg. Took Crinone until negative pregnancy test. 
7. September 2017 we did IVF. Was on Gonal F, cetrotide, and low dose Hcg. We had 40 eggs retrieved, 19 fertilized, and 11 made it to blastocyst stage on day 5 for all freeze. Dr Brasile recommended all freeze so that my body could recover. I did not have OHS. 
8.  October 2017 we did FET. Was started on Estrace 2 mg/three times per day and baby aspirin. Monitored via ultrasound & bloodwork. When lining was greater than 8cm - FET was scheduled. 5 days before transfer I was placed on medrol dose pack, PIO shots, Crinone, estrace, and baby asprin. Transferred 1 blastocyst and went on 24 hour bed rest. After transfer continued on medications until negative pregnancy test. 
9.  November 2017 same protocol. Only change was 1 10 mg Valium prior to FET. December got BFP after 2 week wait. Continued on PIO and Crinone. Ultrasound and bloodwork weekly. At week 7 no heartbeat. Diagnosed blighted ovum. 
10.  Did rush PGS testing in March prior to our 3rd transfer.  Transferred on PGS normal embryo with same med protocol as our prior FET.  BFN after 2 week wait.  No remaining embryos from 1st retrieval. 
11.  In June did a second IVF retrieval.  Was on Gonal F, cetrotide, and low dose Hcg.  Retrieved 22 eggs, 9 fertilized, 4 ended up making it to blast stage and being frozen after PGS biopsy done.  PGS testing revealed 2 normal, 2 abnormal.  
12.  In July we did FET. Was started on Estrace 2 mg/three times per day and baby aspirin. Monitored via ultrasound & bloodwork. When lining was greater than 8cm - FET was scheduled. 5 days before transfer I was placed on medrol dose pack, PIO shots, Crinone, estrace, and baby asprin. Transferred 1 blastocyst and went on 24 hour bed rest.  Added Lovenox to medication regimen every night. Continued on medications until negative pregnancy test.
13.  Did an ERA cycle based on Dr. Brasile's recommendations that revealed that I was 24 hours pre-receptive.
14.  In September we did the same preparation for a FET.  The only change was I took 24 hours more medication prior to transfer to correct for my ERA.  Took Lovenox after transfer every evening until negative pregnancy test.  we only went through initial diagnostics with him. When he gave us the only option of IVF (which we could not afford with him), we went for a second opinion elsewhere and are much happier. We originally started with just taking clomid, then added letrozole. These drugs were to help produce more/better ""follicles"". I was having trouble with one of my tubes (blockage), so it was recommended I pause treatment and have it removed (which I did). We are now back on track with meds, and have since done 2 IUI procedures. First IVF retrieval med combo of Gonal-F/ Menapur.  We didn't get as many mature eggs as we thought/hoped.  Dr. Glassner decided we needed to slow the process down for my body.  
So for my second IVF retrieval he did a med combo Birth control (3 weeks), then Gonal-F/ Menapur/lupron.  This process was longer, but so worth it.  We had triple the amount of mature eggs/ and triple the amount of normal embryos - ecstatic !At first we did letrozole, and I was monitored for ovulation, we did timed intercourse. Next, round I also did letrozole with a higher dose and timed intercourse. Followed, letrozole and clomid with timed intercourse. We then did genetric testing which delayed us for a month. Following, we did clomid and letrozole with IUI, the following round i was not as responsive, so we tried injectables and IUI, and then we began the ivF journey. So far, I had 1 egg retrieval with 1 FET. He suggested we do PGT tested frozen embryos. The 1 FET resulted in a 9 week miscarriage. Now, he started me on NOrethindorne for a month prior to doing the next FET. He did egg retrievel for me . So before I had to take medicine for 10-14 days in injection forms and then I had to go in for visits in a daily basis to check me levels to be ready for retrievel. During this time I also had a 9,5 cm cyst on my one ovary which dr glassner drained before starting medicines for egg retrievel because I had a hysterectomy he didn’t want me to do surgery before egg retrievel to remove the cyst Incase I’d lose the ovary. He wanted to get as many eggs as possible during retrievel. During the medicine taking the cyst filled up so the day of egg retrievel he drained the cyst Aswell as retrieving eggs, if it wasn’t for him I would’ve not gotten the amount of eggs he retrieved and possibly would’ve had surgery before the egg retrievel process and possibly only have had one ovary. Dr glassner is caring and patient and logical. He saved my ovaries in a sense and gave us the best chance by first draining the cyst before egg retrievel instead of surgery. He is amazing! Thank you!FET prep cycles using oral estrogen and patches, progesterone in oil injections and progesterone vaginal suppositories. Due to my PCOS and anovulation, I was put on rounds of Clomid and Letrozole to induce ovulation.  I would be seen at least once if not twice a week to measure my progress and to see if ovulation was occurring.  Once they were comfortable with the ovulation taking place, I had two cycles with IUI that didn't time up properly.  On the third and final cycle, I took a booster shot to ensure the timing was correct and luckily got pregnant on the third try.  I was offered a more aggressive form of IUI if desired but after learning the risks, we declined and moved onto IVF. 

Our plan from the start was an egg retrieval with freeze all PGD testing due to my age. Please also note I only have one ovary.

Cycle #1 follistim/ganarelix protocol failed-only 2 eggs developed-canceled 

Cycle #2 follistim/Lupron-8 eggs retrieved/2 made it to blastocyst. 2 frozen.

Cycle #3 follistim/ganarelix higher dose/ 11 eggs retrieved/ 2 made it to blastocyst

Cycle #4-follistim/ganarelix/ 15 eggs retrieved/4 made it to blastocystsHysteroscopy, doxycycline for inflammation), hormone stimulation injections for retrieval, egg retrieval, ICSI, ERA (endometrial receptivity assay)- which showed that my timing of transfer needs to be adjusted/individualized to me, PGS, PGD, intralipid infusion/prednisone/Lovenox (for immune response and potential blood clots related to unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss), scheduled transfer (upcoming)We have done one trigger with timed intercourse.  We have also done 4 iuis.  The first iui I took 2.5mg of letrozole and ovidrel for my trigger.  The second iui I took 5 mg of letrozole and ovidrel for my trigger.  The third iui I did 5mg of letrozole and 2.5mg of clomind and ovidrel for my trigger.  The fourth iui I did 5mg of letrozole and 75ius of follistim and ovidrel for my trigger.  None of these protocols resulted in an positive pregnancy test.  We are currently in the stimulation phase of ivf.  We are doing 75ius of menopur and 225 ius of follistim.1st cycle--100 clomid
2nd cycle--150 clomid, 5 letrozole
He was pretty dictatorial and didn't describe rationales, other than being ""aggressive""--his favorite word evidently.Metformin, Letrozole, Clomid, Gonal-F, Menopur, Cetrotide, HCG Trigger Shot. Different levels of each. One cycle he did a maxed out dosage of a combination of Letrozole and Clomid.Our first cycle with Dr. Gocial was a medicated IUI with letrozole.
This resulted in a pregnancy that was unfortunately lost at 8 weeks.  Dr. Gocial performed a D&C and additional follow up testing including a hysteroscopy.

Our second cycle was another letrozole IUI.  We needed to adjust dosing during this cycle to better my response.

Currently we are in our third IUI cycle and combined both clomid and letrozole.I had a low AMH with history or one miscarriage that was a trisomy he he moved to recommend IVF very quickly if I wanted to avoid another potential  miscarriage. I’m not sure about what protocol he used specifically for my IVF plan but intend on finding out. He also tested my husbands sperm later than he should have & found his morphology to be zero. He asked him to do a repeat test which was a bit better but recommended ICSI for all eggs instead of half of the eggs or as a backup. I started this process right before I turned 40. I was tested for all of the norms ( egg reserve, uterine polyps, tubal damage ....). My egg retrieval was almost aborted because Dr. Gocial thought that I was going to hyperstimulate. He monitored me everyday and thankfully everything went well. He suggested PGD/PGS testing  and I declined . My first transfer I used one embryo. He second I used two. Both produced negative pregnancy test . At that point Dr. Gocial suggest that I get a ERA done. The rest showed that I was 2 days pre-receptive . To be sure he suggested that a second ERA be performed. The results were the same as the first . Using that data , the next cycle I took two extra days of Crinone. The cycle was a positive pregnancy test . There was a strong heartbeat at 6 weeks and 8 weeks. At 8 weeks and 5 days the heartbeat had stopped. I’m waiting for the results of the embryo biopsy . Dr. Gocial suggested that I take a break before the next cycle . During the next 4 weeks I will be taking Norethindrone to suppress any possible endometriosis that has not been detected during other testing. He believes that this will assist with any implantation issues. I will also be doing genetic testing prior to transfer the next cycle .  For egg retrieval - gonal f, which was reduced based on my body’s quick response. Cabergoline to help prevent OHSSS. I am receiving fertility treatment due to my husband’s journey with cancer. Prior to my husband’s diagnosis we had conceived one child naturally and had no prior history of infertility. My husband froze sperm prior to starting his treatments and is currently still undergoing treatment. I began this process over a year ago so far I have been through a lot of testing and diagnosis. This includes, 1.) the clomid challenge in order to see if I was able to grow more follicles (it worked, I grew more follicles) 2.) Tons of bloodwork to test my cycle and how I ovulate 3.) Ultrasounds (internal and external to check the status of my uterus and follicles (showed that I responded well to the clomid) 4.) Hysteroscopy to see how viable my uterus is (which they found a fibroid in the uterine cavity and I then needed to have a hysteroscopic myomectomy), 5.)HSG which tested for block fallopian tubes (which we learned my remaining tube is blocked. I had one removed in 2009) 6.) 1st cycle if IVF up to egg retrieval 7.) Embryo freezing 8.) FET cycle in about 2 weeks.For me, it was pretty basic protocol. We’re there because my husbands vasectomy reversal was not successful. Luckily, my fertility is only limited as much as any other 38 year old woman’s, no specific issues. So I started with menopur and gonal f in the morning and at night. A few days later we added cetrotide, and then lupron and trigger shot 48 hours before retrieval. I got 8 eggs with 5 fertilized that round. Only 1made it to blastocyte stage. Dr. Brasile recommended another round to get more eggs and have better odds, which we agreed with. She upped my doses and we got 15 eggs that round, with 2 embryos making it to blast. We opted for genetic screening, sending all 3 embryos from both rounds, and ended up with one healthy embryo waiting for transfer. Dr. Glassner suggested an IUI during my initial appointments / testing to increase my chance of conception.  Since the initial did not work, he suggested Clomid for 3 cycles, increasing the dosage each time w/ IUI. All IUIs were negative.  Due to the failed IUIs and my low AMH level, he suggested bypassing further injectibles and to continue w/ IVF.  About to begin my initial IVF cycle. I was on an 11 day regimen of Follistim and Menopur, will ganarellix used from days 6-11. We triggered with HCG which we believed would be best since we were going for the highest number possible. We discussed my previous RE’s recommendation of using a Lupron protocol, however because of my
DOR he was candid to say this may actually have the opposite effect. As a result, we retrieved 9 mature follicles which was in our goal range originally outlined during our consultation. My 1st cycle we started clomid 50mg 2x a day days 2-6. I than had my first intrauterine ultrasound and discovered my lining was abnormally thick. He than decided to wait till next cycle during my bleed to take a look. He than decided to do the Hysteroscopy and was please with the results after removing extra tissue. This last cycle we did 50mg clomid 2x a day for 3-7 and letrozal I had 2 follicles and an iui. I did get my period and decided to take a break this month because I need to pay some of my fertility bills down.For both embryo transfers I was taking Gonal-F injections and having ultrasounds and blood work until I was ready for transfer. Dr. Glassner wanted my body to ovulate to help the transfer work. Once my body started to ovulate I had my embryo transfer. I also was on estradiol pills and progesterone in oil shots. Once I was pregnant I continued the pills and progesterone in oil shots until my 12th week of pregnancy. I dont ovulate on my own and cycles are too long.  In 2017 we did several cycles with clomid and metformin and my body did not respond at all. He was in my insurance network copays were only 15.00. Had to stop due to other health related issues. In 2018 they were no longer in my network copays were 45.00 for each visit and bills were applied to deductible. This time around we did femara and clomid my body responded to the meds I achieved two perfect follicles, ovulated but did not conceive my cervical mucus was there enough to help the sperm. I received bills in excess of 600.00 as my balance due to the deductible so i had to stop treatmentWe started out with Clomid only and IUI cycles. We then personally decided to only to natural cycles of IUI because I did not feel comfortable with the meds, which he was fine with. However recommend meds because it was not working without. He is now recommending we move forward with IVF because we gave it a few tries already. First round of IVF- antagonist protocol. I ended up ovulating an hour before my retrieval and Dr. Brasile was only able to retrieve one mature egg. Since my body ovulated even with the use of cetrotide, we used Lupron for the next cycle. The egg from this round became a day 6 embryo and was frozen for PGS testing. 

Second round of IVF- Flare protocol. This resulted in 10 mature eggs. Of the 10, 8 fertilized, 4 made it to day 5 embryos. The embryo from the first round plus three from the second were sent for PGS testing and one was transferred on day 5. All four that were sent for testing came back abnormal. The one that was transferred resulted in a pregnancy. I'm currently 8 months pregnant with a baby boy!In the beginning of our treatment Dr. Glassner began with IUIs because we had an unexplained fertility diagnosis. These did not produce a positive pregnancy. We eventually did get pregnant by monitoring our cycles but that lead to an ectopic pregnancy. It was decided then that I probably have a weak tube. After a year of trying through IUIs, etc we decided to go through IVF. Financially we could not afford IVF but Dr. Glassner and his team worked with an organization called BabyQuest that provided us financial help to pay for our IVF procedure. Without Dr. Glassner's and Baby Quest's help our son would not be here today.For my first cycle, my husband and I went straight to IVF after an ectopic pregnancy. My other tube looked damaged, but Dr. Glassner recommended IVF. I do not know the exact protocol, but I believe it was antagonist. Since I am an otherwise healthy person, I started injections at my next cycle. I was overstimulated this cycle, and because of this I had to freeze my embroys, and only 1 was good enough quality for freezing. My frozen transfer was a few months later, which resulted in pregnancy and then miscarriage at 6 weeks. After this, we discussed removal of my other tube, but I did not want to do that, so at my request, we tried clomid for about 6 cycles. No pregnancy resulted from the clomid. We then went on to our next IVF cycle. This time Dr. Glassner added the HGH injections and Lupron, which resulted in a much better quality eggs (and no overstimulation!) I had 2 embroys transferred, which resulted in pregnancy, but miscarriage at 6 weeks. Since this has happened, I decided to move forward with the removal of my other tube. I go back to discuss next steps in a short few weeks! 100 mg Clomid for 5 days for my 1st IUI cycle with monitoring and timed IUI. I have no idea why she chose this course. 2nd IUI I did 150 mg Clomid for 2 or 3 days then 100 mg for the remaining days (5 days of Clomid total) with a trigger shot (7500 Novarel) for IUI because my fiancé went out of town. Booster of 2500 Novarel a week after initial shot to potential improve success. I am in the TWW now. Clomid - clomid challenge test
Clomid + iui - 3 cycles
Injectables + iui - 1 cycle followed by my husband getting vericocele surgery
Injectables + iui - 3 cycles
Moved onto ivf using injectables and menopur and 5 days in dr glassner concerted the cycle to iui due to my poor response and we ended up getting pregnant that cycle! 
Protocols were always based on my low amh which put my egg quality in question 
Currently I’m back with dr glassner for baby #2 we did three cycle of injectables iui with no luck and plan to move ivf in April 
We began our IVF treatments with Dr. Orris in May 2017. With that we used Follistim and Menopur for egg stimulation. I responded well to the medications and we retrieved 7 eggs, of which 5 fertilized with ICSI (used due to male factor infertility). Dr. Orris choose to do a day 3 transfer of 2 embryos which appeared to be developing at a faster rate than the other 3 embryos. Those 3 did not develop past day 5. From our transfer we had an ectopic pregnancy. Methotrexate was given to dissolve the pregnancy and save my right tube. After 3 months of recovery, we started our second IVF cycle, again using Follistim and Menopur. However, this time the doses were smaller to do a mini IVF protocol and obtain fewer eggs. I still responded well, acquiring 5 eggs at retrieval. 4 were fertilized with ICSI. This time we did a day 5 transfer as they were all developing at the same rate. 1 embryo was transferred, resulting in a chemical pregnancy. The other 4 embryos did not make it. From here we have done 3 additional IUI’s (our insurance covers them), while we save for another IVF treatment. For IUI, we used clomid,  letrozole and progesterone. All negative tests resulted from these IUI’s. 5 out of my 6 cycles he did Mini-stim protocol because my body was responding so well and I had excellent lining. I actually got pregnant on mini-stim cycle.
On the 2nd cycle, after a failed cycle on mini-stim, he tried HRT but then switched me back to the mini-stim.
I had a total of 4 hysteroscopies so he can make sure the embryos didn't take because there is an issue developing. He also did a scratch (3rd cycle) but that didn't help and it was a failed cycle. Only the 4th cycle took and I was pregnant for 16 weeks until I went into pre-term labor and lost my baby-girl.For each round of IVF, I was on menopur (2) per day, Follistim (starting out at different volumes each time with decreasing amounts.  Started mostly at 300 then decreased to 150 by the end).  Several cycles did Ganirelix.  Several cycles did Lupron (20) and growth hormone.  Most trigger shots were 10,000 of HCG. One trigger shot was 5,000 HCG and Lupron.  I was a mini stim IVF protocol. I think antagonist , i did injections for 2 weeks maybe a little more. No BCP. We focused on taking supplements and metformin to increase my egg quality.  this was done based on my age and AMh levels. I produced a 9 eggs all great quality. 8 fertilized and 5 made it to day 5 blasts in great quality.  we froze 4 and successfully transferred one. Strategy was to try and get husbands count up and increase motility. He had him on different vitamins to help increase this. We did do clomid at least once but the main course of action was IUI. Most of the time my husbands count was still low and motility was low but my husband and I decided to proceed even knowing it was a low risk. There were a few tests my husband took when count was looking better but we decided to take a break (financial reasons) when we knew IVF was next option.  We were told about different trials we could sign up for but did not We started with Gonal F, menipur and cetrotide. We retrieved 10 eggs with three embryos. We transferred two with a positive pregnancy test. That lead to miscarriage. Rationale was he saw nothing besides my husband’s previous vasectomy preventing us from conceiving.

Second cycle: only Gonal F. We were part of a study of Gonal F he recommended. We were told we were good candidates.
We only had 7 eggs. In the end we had two embryos that were abnormal after PGS.

Third cycle, he said let’s put everything into it. We did human growth hormone, Gonal F, Lupron and Lovenox. He said that the growth hormone was shown to improve egg quality. Lovenox because I showed some elevated clotting factor. They decided to trigger me earlier than I had anticipated. In the end the majority of my eggs were immature. This after we only had 7 follicles.I did stims for an egg retrieval in Oct-Nov 2014, egg retrieval 11/11/14, pgs on 9 day 5 embryos with 6 normal (3 boys and 3 girls). We did a FET (with acupuncture before and after) of boy and girl embryos (1 of each - 2 total) dec 2014, BFP followed by missed miscarriage (no heartbeat) in jan 2015 and dne jan 2015 (it was the girl that stuck). Did another FET (1 boy and 1 girl) with acupuncture before but not after in apr 2015 and had my first daughter jan 2016. Did a mini stim cycle jan-feb 2017 and FET (1 boy and 1 girl) with acupuncture before but not after in feb 2017 and had my 2nd daughter Oct 2017.We started with Clomid + timed intercourse, then moved to Clomid + Letrozole + timed intercourse, then Clomid + Letrozole + IUIs. Although I produced good follicles and eggs, none of these methods worked. Unexplained infertility. For IVF, my protocol was Gonal F stims, then Cetrotide and Estrace. I retrieved 21 eggs, but only 4 fertilized. We transfered one embryo and none of the others made it to freeze. Results of first IVF was negative and we are starting a second round in July - changing meds and protocol now that Dr. Orris knows that I have egg quality issues.I switched to Dr. Glassner after a successful pregnancy when I wanted to start treatment for a second child, so Dr. Glassner prescribed a round of injection hormones to bring on ovulation because it was the same protocol we were successful with previously. Unfortunately, our first clinic misdiagnosed my husband's sperm results. We did 2 IUIs with negative results. After the 2nd IUI, Dr Brasile ordered a re-testing of his results because I had had a lot of concerns about my first clinic. Turns out, I was right! The first clinic didn't tell us that his sperm results weren't fully normal. Based on the new results, Dr Brasile immediately changed treatment to IVF. I started on Letrazole 2.5mg the 3rd-7th day of my cycle and started Menopur 75iu on the 6th day for 4 days.  On day 10, we did HCG. I don't remember if the IUI was Day 11 or Day 12. For baby 1 - we did clomid cycles (the highest dose allowed) followed by one cycle of timed intercourse. We then did approx three more cycles with iui the last resulting in our almost three year old.
For baby 2 - we did clomid cycles (again highest dose allowed) followed by iui for three cycles. On cycle four we did clomid and femara with iui and have a 7 month old. For our 3 IVF cycles, the first cycle was I think a more or less standard cycle, which resulted in 13 eggs, but only 5 were mature, even though they were measuring via ultrasound as mature.

For the second cycle, he added HGH to our protocol, because there was evidence that it can kick eggs up a notch. Unfortunately, that did not work for us - we got more eggs, but the quality was not as good as the first cycle.

For the 3rd cycle, even though I definitely do not have PCOS, he felt I was reacting to medication more like a woman who does than a woman who doesn't. Because of that, he put me on metformin and lupron, in addition to the regular drugs. We got more mature eggs, made more embryos, and they were better quality than the previous two. It worked this time!We met with the doctor to explain the situation and they did some testing to ensure they had a full picture of my body (I had already had one miscarriage trying naturally); we then worked with the PGD people in New Jersey (Reprogenetics), which took a lot longer than expected.  Once completed, we started the drug protocols, did the egg retrieval, eggs were tested after five days, re-frozen, and then I returned a month later for implantation.  The practice helped me to arrange all monitoring in DC with Shady Grove (which ironically was covered by insurance - but would not have been, had I been a full patient of Shady Grove's - still dont understand that part!).I had 2 months of Clomid and 2 IUI's with the 1st donor I chose with no luck.  Then I had to change donors (no more samples were available through my bank) and I had 1 more cycle with Clomid.  Dr. Glassner recommended I then begin a cycle with injectibles, with the plan of seeing how my body would react.   I had many less follicles that previous cycles however, I had a sperm dose available and so Dr Pfeffer recommend I do 1 last IUI.  That resulted in a pregnancy and live birth. We tried a low dose antagonist cycle (ectopic pregnancy after IVF) and an agonist cycle (biochemical pregnancy)  , which no other clinic was willing to try with me. It did produce my highest quality embryos. In the end, uterine reasons for my losses were not explored. I was presenting with many Endometriosis symptoms, yet no lap was done, even after the ectopic.We are in processThe IVF process went very quick. It felt like a total of two weeks and then we were doing our transfer. I gave myself shots 2x a day, plus progesterone every other day. I am healthy and ovulate on my own, so we went right to Clomid and Letrizole to increase my follicle production each month (4 months). However, she would only guess as to when we should have sex. I was never given injections to initiate ovulation. 6 cycles of clomid. I would go in the first day of my cycle for an ultrasound and bloodwork. I would come back on day 12 (sometimes day 13 or 14) he would tell be when to have sex. 
For the IUi, same as the clomid, except I would go in for ultrasounds and bloodwork more often. Sometimes 3 days in a row. My husband was “on call” those days.
I’ve only ever done treatments with clomid, femera, and one other medicine to help promote egg production. Our insurance coverage is very limited. We conceived on a cycle where we were having a natural cycle, unfortunately that ended in an early miscarriage. We are currently hoping that we will land a spot in one of the IVF clinical trials that are being offered. First IUI, 100 mg of clomid days 4-8 then timed insemination by ultrasound monitoring. 
Second IUI, 150 mg clomid days 4-8 and timed insemination by ultrasound monitoring. 
Also he added a baby aspirin daily and 1500 mg of metformin daily We wanted to start small and work our way up. Based on insurance and financial commitments, he recommended our treatments around what we felt confortsble with. Since oral meds alone hasn’t worked for us we are now considering IUI and IVF.Gonal F/Folistim high dose.  Menopur 1 or 2 vials twice a day.  Microdose Lupron.  Omnitrope sometimes.  Used clomid once-without good results.  We did 4 Iui’s with dr. Orris. We attempted 3 of them with my husbands sperm and all were unsuccessful. I responded fine to the clomid and gonal. The male factor was just super sever and eventually we needed to cancel our last scheduled iui because my husband had zero sperm. We moved onto iui with donor, I did 100mg of clomid and had two beautiful follicles, the iui in my opinion was timed perfectly and I am now in my tww.1st cycle was the Finox study. Birth control pills, Lupron, aspirin and stimulating meds. Retrieved 10 eggs. 9 mature and 6 fertilized.  Crinone for 12 weeks after. Transferred 2 embryos and conceived and live birthed twins.  The remaining embryos did not make it to day 5. 

2nd cycle: Follistim, Cetrocide and Menopur for 10 days. 7 eggs retrieved, 5 fertilized and only 3 progresses. All 3 stopped progressing by day 4.Cycle 1: times intercourse.  Negative pregnancy test.

Cycle 2: iui w/clomid, low sperm motility. Negative pregnancy test.

Cycle 3: clomid, timed intercourse. Negative pregnancy test.

Cycle 4: 2 iuis w/ clomid, fermera, low sperm motility, low amh,  negative pregnancy test

Cycle 5: gonal-f, ovidrel trigger, timed intercourse over 2 days (iui had to be cancelled by patient).  Waiting outcome.With Dr. Brasille I did 9 IUI’s. We were saving for IVF and she was patient with us trying IUI so many times. For each IUI we did a combination of clomid and/or letrozole. She referred my husband to a urologist to work on sperm counts. Unfortunately, none of those IUI’s resulted in pregnancy.  i went to him knowning i was going to do IVF.  I had trouble ovulating in the past.  I don't recall dosage or exact medications but i followed the exact ivf procedure medicines.His protocols were specific to your needs and would change as he saw fit. He didn't take any shortcutsWe did a mock transfer and ERA because i asked for it. Dr Orris agreed it sounded like a good idea.  I was on 1.5ml of progesterone in oil,  400mg progesterone vaginal suppositories, 2mg estradiol 4 times a day, 50mcg synthroid for my thyroid as well.One egg retrieval, 5 FETs, two chemical pregnancies, one daughter. After the first chemical he had me try a protocol for NK cells with infusions. We did a cycle of  clomid. And then another (because i requested to try again) the. We tried ivf. My egg quality was not great so my cycle got canceled. We then did another ivf cycle which i had my daughter from. 

Recently we did another cycle which i did get pregnant, but had an early miscarriage. My husband and I both tested well. No issues. Lining was always good. And I always stimulated well. Always had good sperm quality. We were shocked IUI didn’t work. We have now moved on to IVF and we have done retrieval and waiting to see how many we can implant Unfortunately, we don't remember anything out of the ordinary.  Estrace, POI, endometrial scratch.
We did a three day transfer the first time. Transferring two embryos and got pregnant with one baby. The second time we unfroze our two year old embryos and transferrred two at day five. We got pregnant with our now son. IVF egg retrieval with lupron, estrodial, and injectables. We got one embryo and he recommended a biopsy of my uterus. Great lining to get the ivf process moving. Birth control to get a period. Z-pack- PIO- vaginal suppositories- doxycycline- 2 cycles IVF. also tried clomid for 2 cyclesDon’t remember specifics but we did adjust meds during last IVF session. Also re-evaluated clomid/iui after finished results. Standard peocedures as explainedBecause my initial consult was around the same time I was starting a new cycle, I had the option to start treatment immediately. i was prescribed 100mg clomid and 1500 mg metformin. Unfortunately the resulted in potentially 8 mature follicles and the cycle was cancelled.Once only prescribed Chlomid for me, but I was anyway producing enough.

 I don't think I even needed it. Clomid increasing in dosages up to 250mg/day through days 4-8 of cycle. Clomid and letrozole together. Follistim 150 / day before IUI. IVF protocol was 150/day and 1 menopur x 13 days for me. Aggressive with meds - pushes for IVF I came to Dr.B after a second early miscarriage (around 4-5 weeks), at the time I had been ttc for ) months. I have a 4 year old son, who I had no issues conceiving. I had presumed low progesterone, so I did 2 cycles of natural ovulation with progesterone supplements. No pregnancy. Then we tried 3 cycles of high dose letrozole to try to make me superovulate. I responded well (1-2 follicles) but All negative. Then 3 cycles of clomid and letrozole and still no pregnancy. Then I was told the next step would be injectables or ivf. I took the summer off. Still not pregnant and I am now back getting worked up for an ivf trial. While getting worked up I am trying another clomid/ letrozole cycleWe did clomid and a trigger shot. Then did an iui. It worked but miscarriedI was on a more aggressive treatment plan which included lipids, lovenox, and neupogen along with the other IVF drugs to help protect me and my baby from an auto-immune disease I have.I remember he focused on getting quality from me, rather than quantity. He focused in on me producing healthy eggs. He’s been very thorough with testing to ensure I remain healthy throughout my process. I know I will get my babies because he really is the best their is. Single embryo transfer has been recommended to us. For my husband and I,  we will cross the bridge when we come to it and have a bigger discussion after our egg retrieval and when we know how many embryos we have His philosophy was to put all of them in due to the low grading. We put 9 in over 3 cycles. 1 stick and then divided for identical twins. Only one embryo transferred ever with him. Strict rules He and their team are pretty dead set on single embryo transfer to reduce risks.Agreed with her recommendation on single embryo transfer.Dr. Gocial was adamant about single embryo transfers. My only comment is that I am a triplet and my husband a twin and I’m 26 years old. I was born two months early and in an incubator for a month so I think I more than most understand the risks of multiple pregnancies . But the difference in my opinion now a days the technology and medical advancements are a lot more than 26 years ago and I think it in a sense can help ease the risk of multiple embryo transfers. Yes every situation is different and can be risky . A single embryo transfer can turn into identical twins , multiple transfer can only one . You never know , it’s up to G-d and ofcourse us as humans doing what we feel is right with caution. But the above is why I feel it’s ok to do multiple and why I would. Single transfer- research shows it’s safestDr. Gocial and Main Line Fertility do single embryo transfer as they want to minimize the risk of multiples.  This is not an issue for us and are thankful for their caution.I believe my dr does single and avoids twins, multiples at all costs. For my age, he would only consider single Dr. Orris chose eSET for our case as I do not struggle with infertility, but my husband and I are doing IVF due to my husband’s cancer diagnosis and continued treatment. Dr. Orris wants to keep his patients safe and limit multiples pregnancies. We haven’t transferred yet, and we only have 1 embryo to work with, but given a choice I would have liked to implant 2. I asked about that early on, before I knew my numbers, and was told multiple times that they would only do 1 at a time. Had I ended up with more than 1, I would have fought them on this. Main Line has a strict one embryo policy, and I appreciate and agree with their ethical rationale behind it.  I'd be fine with multiple embryo if it came to this. I had the PGS testing done on the embryos, so Dr. Glassner only allowed transfer of one embryo. He stated that if I had not done PGS testing I would be able to put two embryos in. I was happy with his decision to put one embryo in because our embryos were considered genetically normal. My first time, I only had one I was able to transfer. The second time, I had multiple embroys, and the Dr. covered all the pros and cons or transferring multiple. I wanted to do 2 and he agreed. I was very informed in my decision. We have not done ivf at this time. I trust what Dr. Orris has decided on both our multiple transfer and our single transfer. We discussed only transferring a single embryo at the time because due to my age I am already a high-risk and Orris didn't want to make it even worse.
Now, after I miscarried at 16 weeks, we know that it has to be a single embryo as clearly more than one is too much for my body to handle. He made a good call and we agreed with him completely.Dr. Glassner allowed us to transfer 2 embryos and I appreciated that option because my husband and I were open to singletons or multiples. We wanted our best chance of having at least 2 children.Dr. Orris expressed to us that he likes to be as responsible as possible when it comes to his practice - and with my young age of 31, he recommended a single embryo transfer vs. multiple. Multiples are typically a more difficult, more high-risk pregnancy and as we don't have the clock working against us, he felt that we should only transfer one embryo (although he gave us the option to transfer more if we wanted to). We opted to only transfer one.He said it is our choice though he strongly advises single.No transfers done with Dr. BrasilleThe more the merrier was my thought.  But doctor glassner didnt want to put me in jeopardy of more than 2 embryos because of my history of not being able to carry full term.  He brought me down to reality from my octomom vision. I was very grateful.After the other failed transfer and the poor quality of my embryos he agreed we should put 2 in. In my specific case, he recommended multiple embryo transfer due to the numerous unsuccessful cycles I had. He was allowed me to have a say in the decision as well. Together we thought 2 was the right choice. Our next transfer we’re only putting 1 in. He treats each patient & each cycle  individually. I only have one embryoAlways let us make the decision. We always did 2 embryos at a time. Did not get to that pointPrefers single He mentioned the multiple embryo transfer when we do ivfI agree with Dr. Glassner's approach to do single embryo transfers. I felt he was thoughtful and considerate.Dr. Orris wants you to have the best chance to not only have a baby, but a healthy pregnancy as well, so that’s the discussion we have always had surrounding transfer. I believe each patient is different, and he has that discussion based on the individual. Strong preference to transfer one embryo at a time.  Now, we had done genetic testing on the embryos and everything seems normal on my end, I am not sure if his preference would change with different patients - I'd imagine soHe highly suggested egg retrieval with freeze all and genetic PGD testing with a later single FET. My husband had expressed his goals of avoiding multiples and reducing genetic risks so this could be why he suggested the above.He only will transfer one embryo at a time, due to his protocol. Its healthier for mom and baby to be.Dr. Gocial is very conservative in that area. I respect him for that. For my individual situation he suggest single embryo transfer. I’m 42 and wouldn’t want to tale the chance or risk of multiple births . We were advised based on my age and it being my first cycle to only transfer 1 embryo. The office recommends only one embryo transfer for a person my age. I  didn’t have a preference either way. We ended up with only one embryo, so that’s what we went with. ",9.0,7.6999999999999975,"Dr. Glassner was very honest with our situation, and since he was the second RE we visited, he provided an active approach with statistics and realistic expectations. I used the trigger shot day 9 and had the Iui day11.Because of our previous miscarriages, we knew we could get pregnant, but we were concerned of the quality of the eggs. Took Crinone until negative pregnancy test. After transfer continued on medications until negative pregnancy test. Did an ERA cycle based on Dr. Brasile's recommendations that revealed that I was 24 hours pre-receptive. The second iui I took 5 mg of letrozole and ovidrel for my trigger. This resulted in a pregnancy that was unfortunately lost at 8 weeks. At that point Dr. Gocial suggest that I get a ERA done. Did not get to that pointPrefers single He mentioned the multiple embryo transfer when we do ivfI agree with Dr. Glassner's approach to do single embryo transfers."
75,Main Line Fertility  ,cost,"It was all alacarte. I paid 10K for first round, 9,500 for second.My insurance doesn't cover IVF but does cover other infertility procedures, medications, etc. So I just had a $35 copay with each visit
All of our procedures were covered by insurance. We were so lucky.Pretty standardIUI was out of pocket-$480. Trigger shot was $75. All other visits/procedures were co paysAbout $13,000 since we started Most was covered by insuranceSo far we have had minimal costs other than co-pays.  We anticipate paying around $20,000 for IVF and PGD.Various costs associated with meds ranging from $15-$2,000 per cycle.
IVF $8,200 plus the cost of medications.
FET $3500 plus the cost of medications.
PGS testing approximately $3500.Copays for consults, other than that didn’t pay anything out of pocket. IVF at their facility runs close to $20k. the diagnostics associated with my case have been covered by insurance, with the exception of a co-pay for each visit. 
IUI is not covered by my insurance and is around $500. IVF is also not covered, but they do offer discounted rates to participant in clinical trials (about half off of the treatment cost). For IVF it was roughly 25000 total for retrieval, meds, PGT testing. My IUI was covered, meds for injectaboe rounds were about $700They were very reasonable regarding numbers we researched before going into our journey of creating embryos to get ready for using a gestational Carrier. I feel they give you the best care and charge any amazing price for what they do for you and the way they do! I recommend dr glassner and his team any day! I have excellent insurance that covered most of the costs.  However, I did have to pay out-of-pocket for the ERA biopsy and for the donor embryo.  I was somewhat surprised at the ""restocking"" fee when the cycle was cancelled as the embryo was not touched and there was no legal paperwork involved (at least none that I was party to, and I would imagine I would have to have been for there to have been a legal transfer).  Don't remember specifics, but luckily with insurance, costs were minimal compared to what we were expecting.$22,000Iui was covered by my insurance and I am not sure of the break down of the costs.  IVF is not covered and all in, including PGD, it is approx. $18,000-20,000.IUI is covered by our insurance with a $30 copay.  Medications aside from. The HCG trigger shots were also covered.  Triggers cost $70 each.
Each office visit was subject to my specialist copay fee of $60.About $25 all in for one cycle- IVF, anesthia, retrieval, ICSI, PGT, biopsies, shipping fees, lab and monitoring fees, transfer, freezing, storage for a year Everything but ERA was one hundred percent covered by our insurance. Medication,  bloodwork and office visit copays, surgical copays, anesthesia copay, IVF costs for procedure and medicationsI’m not sure..billing is a mess. If we consider what we’ve paid out of pocket, what insurance has paid, and what our latest bill says we owe, we’re well over double the original estimate.My diagnostic testing was covered by insurance; however medications, IUIs, and IVF costs were not covered, and therefore out of pocket. We specifically expressed our concern about costs especially since we were already thinking we would need to complete 2 retrieval’s and have no insurance coverage. Dr. Glassner was very open to say he would work with us in any way he could- that all we needed to do was to talk to him and be direct, but he would make sure we had a baby, in a way we could afford. After price shopping, this was the first time we EVER had an RE actually work with us and discuss cost.My insurance covers the procedures but most office visits we pay 40% they average appointment is 825Embryo transfer cost about $2500, PGS testing cost about $3000 In 2018 very expensive.  My insurance coverage does not cover ivf and they were out of network this time around. Received a bill for 680.00 after they were applied to my out of network deductible and 45.00 copay due at the time of service.  Clomid and femara out of pocket not covered by my insurance$60 co-pays each time. $450 per IUI. $60 Clomid cycle. IUI procedure- out of pocket cost = ~$600
IVF- my insurance covers up to 4 egg retrievals as long as you have no embryos already frozen. I think the out of pocket cost for an IVF cycle is ~$25,000, but many clinical trial opportunities are offered and can help pay for treatment if you qualify. My insurance does not cover IVF, but I was able to get in a clinical trial for my meds so there was no cost there. There are no hidden costs, they lay it all out on sheet for you when you first come in. Although, I defintiely wasn't prepared the first time for the additional cost of having to do a frozen cycle since I wasn't expecting to overstimulate. When things didn't work, and since cost is an issue with us, Dr. Glassner did everything in his power to help us with the second cycle, which I could not have been more grateful for. IVF is very expensive in PA at no fault of the Dr., so knowing that Dr. Glassner and his team go above and beyond to make your baby dreams come true, make me feel better about choosing this practice. We have spent around $27,000 so far on 2 rounds of IVF and a frozen transfer (and all that comes with that).
All of my regular office visits not associated with the actual IVF cycle, diagnostic bloodwork, ultrasound, hysteroscopy, etc, were covered by my insurance medical plan. So my copay/deductibles applied.My iuis have been covered by insurance so I’ve only had to pay for meds so far. I purchased the trigger shot Novarel for $140 at my clinic. I also have to pay $40 copay every time I walk in the door, even for bloodwork. Paid out of pocket for iuis and injectable medications and ivf...monitoring appointments were covered with a specialist co pay  IUI’s - covered by insurance 
IVF - $9,500 
Anesthesia - $500
Medications - Totalled about $3000 for one cycleThe costs were all advised in advance and there were no surprises, which I like a lot. We paid $2100 per egg. Ended up getting 10 eggs and they charged us for 9. Transfer was $3500.
Our last two cycles were embryo donation from their embryo donation bank. The cost is $6050 for embryo + transfer.
The don't nickel & dime you...The frozen embryo transfers were around $5,000 not including medications.  The IVF monitoring and retrieval’s were $9,000 not including medications.  The PGS testing was $3,000 for any number of embryos.  I do not recall. I remember paying a $200-300 for IUI. The pre-work labs were costly. They were honest about some that were not necessary but optional so we did opt out on a few. Over three cycles with meds we have spent approximately $75,000.I don’t recall the exact costs, but the breakdown was: fertility meds (for pre egg retrieval and pre and post FET) which were partially covered by my insurance and I partially paid out of pocket for, the egg retrieval itself (again partially covered by insurance), anesthesia for egg retrieval, PGS which was about $2000 for 9 5-day embryos if I remember correctly and not covered by insurance, the FETs themselves which I think was about $3000 each (again partially covered), the costs for appointments, blood work, ultrasounds, other diagnostic testing (acronyms I don’t remember) which were all partially covered by my insurance also and acupuncture before, during and after which was $75 per visit on average and varied from multiple times a week during certain parts of cycles to weekly during others to every other week during others and not covered by my insurance.We paid everything out of pocket, as our insurance does not cover infertility, so prices were $500 for IUI, $9,800 for IVF and $500 for anesthesia. I participated in a clinical study (another plus for going through MLF) which covered all of my meds.All of my medications were covered by health insurance, so I only had to pay my office co-pay.They seemed very reasonably priced. It certainly depends on your insurance coverage but they were 1/10 the cost of UPenn Fertility for IUI.I paid copays, medicine and for my IUI visit. Our insurance covered everything except copays for office visits and drugs. We did have to pay out of pocket for iui which ran about $450-$475 per time. I believe my insurance covered most visits except the actual IUI.$2100 per egg + $3500 transfer + approx $1000 medsMy insurance covered everything but IUI, IVF, and genetic testing. It was just a specialist co-pay.Over $5,000IUIs were $457 each (which I think is very far pricing. We have paid more at other clinics and didn’t get as good care as we are getting there.) and everything else have been billed to our insurance. I had my copays and I used my FSA.IVF round was $9000 for just monitoring and retrieval.  If you did a fresh transfer  with that cycle, add $800.  Frozen embryo transfers were $3500I think, this far we are about 3,000ish in. My first cycle was a study so the treatment costs were very minimal. My 2nd cycle Dr Glassner greatly reduced so that it was affordable for us to do. Insurance covered:
Appointments: $40
IUI:$20
Medications: $7 to $49 range 

Not covered by insurance:
Gonal-F and Ovidrel: $840 ( with 25% veterans discount)IUI’s - covered by insurance
Medication - only covered Co-pays for IUI medication. My insurance covered beginning testing but the ivf procedure was $15,000 plus the cost of medications. I did not have ivf coverageAround 7 thousand for frozen transfer including medications. I think retrieval was around $25k and each FET was around $6-8kWe spent over $100,000 on treatments, our insurance didn’t cover much. Dr. Glassner always helped us with lower/discounted costs, payment plans, & he even waived some fees during a few cycles. We have insurance that covers 90% of the costs20,000After all was said and done it was about $20,000Fertility costs are expensive in my opinion. Over $10,000 for one cycle. Around $30,000. However, I am doing a donor cycle now that Dr. Glassner is giving me a scholarship. I will not pay any of the $16000 cost for eggs or procedure.Always willing to work with youapprox $8,000 for IVF in 2012, not including medications.Expensive above what insurance covered. But John worked with meSo far no cost since I have only done an initial consult and had a cancelled IUI cycle. copays, insurance mostly covered expencesOver $20k for one IVF cycle Each visit has a $50 co/pay. Special procedures- tube flushing- have additional costs. Labs were expensive. Meds can be expensive. But this is not due to MLF, it’s due to my insuranceMost of it has been covered by my insurance except my husband's chromosome testing I had some fertility coverage, but we ran out by the second retrieval. IVF is super expensive, but Dr Orris is willing to work with you on cost to make having a baby a reality PGT- genetic testing of embryos- $3200
$9000 IVF cycle without insurance? (includes all)
Medications - 2-4000$ insurance can cover
Embryo transfer $3500 (includes all)I believe I was charged 5000$ for retrieval #4, 6000$ for retrieval #3, 7000$ for retrieval #2. Retrieval #1 was cancelled. My insurance paid for some of the monitoring. If you do FET With PGD the first transfer is only 2000$. I believe the ERA was 1,300$. PGD was somewhere around 7000$ with all associated fees. IUI's weren't covered by insurance. ALL Monitoring was, all I had to do was pay co-pays. Paid out of pocket for the IUI's. For IVF, I cannot thank the financial coordinator and my guess is Dr. Glassner himself in helping me afford IVF. I was open and honest with him during my IVF consult about my finances. He let me know he'd help me out anyway he could. I don't know how I will EVER be able to show him my gratitude and love that I have for him and his clinic. I HAVE NO WORDS. Speechless. He has helped me out BEYOND my expectations! Once again Dr. Glassner THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart!! If there is one way to show my gratitude towards you and your clinic it is by writing this review! This is the least I could do!I’m blessed with 100% IVF coverage . They do have a financial coordinator that explains cost and financing in depth if needed. My ERAs were not covered , but I was made aware of the cost before hand . Any anesthesia cost are also not covered under any insurance. Storage fees for embryo and sperm are about 700 per year . 10,000 for an IVF cycle We had to pay out of pocket for everything but medicine, but we had a first responders discount.

77,University of Pennsylvania Penn Fertility Care,doctor,"Samantha Butts was recommended to me by my GYN. During our first consultation, she made me feel at ease and answered all my questions in detail. I liked how quickly and candidly she delivered information to me and I felt her warm bedside manner which confirmed the previous reviews that I had read about her.However, throughout the process, our communication declined. It became very difficult to get in contact with her directly even when using the portal, most times there were repeated follow ups, and as changes occurred during the process a plan that was initially communicated and agreed upon would be changed with little to no communication /explanation which created further delays. Once she and I had a discussion about the lack of and difficulties in our communication, it improved immediately and our standards of communication has remained consistent. Furthermore, she offers great medical insights on what may be going on with you and your cycle and makes recommendations based upon these insights which eliminates the cookie cutter response and approach.I have found Dr. Gracia to be intelligent, responsive and warm. She is generally quite receptive as well but there are times that I feel she could be a bit more open to a different idea or a less studied approach or intervention.When we saw Dr Shah she would always let us share our questions and provided very detailed (with notes!) explanations of her answers and, at times, what would happen next in our treatment. Unfortunately, we only saw Dr Shah in the office twice (an initial consultation and a meeting before starting IVF). After failed transfers, it would take at least a month to see her and so it felt like she didn't really know us and wasn't closely following our journey. She was conservative in her practice and was adamant at continuing the same protocol even after repeated failures. You need to be an advocate for your own needs and protocol because issues that might come up for you or your health might not be closely monitored or addressed if they're outside the standard protocol. Dr. Kalra is a very kind and knowledgeable woman. We saw her after two natural miscarriages, and the OBGYN pointed us towards Penn to try and get some answers as to why it happened twice. Dr. Kalra sat down with us and mapped out the next steps and what blood work and tests were needed. She explained the process of pregnancy and why miscarriages happen from time to time. While under her care, my husband and I went on two have two more miscarriages and she could not have been more compassionate during that time. She really felt for us and it showed. 

During the course of treatment, often times you will see the nursing staff and not necessarily your doctor. When I did see Dr. Kalra, she was really great. Dr. Divya’s strengths include showing compassion, being detail oriented, knowledgeable, and thorough. I haven’t had any negative experiences with Dr. Divya. She explained what would happen every step of the way and also explained the results to all of our testing. She also explained the potential treatments before the results were back and then explained then gave options for treatment. She gave me her opinion, but let my husband and I decide what the best treatment would be for us.Dr Barnhart was thorough and caring. The clinic is big so I did see a different doctor for each procedure and often times I only saw the nurse or tech. I would get a phone call from his nurse in the afternoon with instructions. I do feel like he was not that present for my cycles as I am sure he was involved behind the scenes managing everything. Dr. Mainigi is thorough, communicative, compassionate, and incredibly detail-oriented. During a really vulnerable time, she completely put my partner and me at ease. She knew so many details about my story during each of our conversations and was able to talk about my medical history in detail without even glancing at my chart. She is incredibly prepared for each appointment. She's also very empathetic and completely understands the delicate balance between emotional urgency and cost. Would recommend to anyone -- She's the best!!Dr. O'Neill has a warm and engaging demeanor. She is thorough and accessible in her explanation of options and procedures. She is understanding of the financial pressures of using donor sperm and makes sure my wife and I are fully on board with the plan at each step of the process. I appreciate her careful balance between expressing optimism and hope, and being realistic about the process of fertility care. I would recommend her without any hesitation to any of my friends or family members in need of fertility care.Dr. Butts was extremely thorough when developing my treatment protocol. She requested surgery records from my OBGYN and used all the information gathered to give me predictions of my chances of success with retrieval cycles and my overall chances of conception in general. As a patient who tends to worry, Dr. Butts was able to assuage my fears with evidence based information and years of experience. I truly felt that we were in this journey together and that she would be willing to do whatever possible to help me achieve success. I liked working with Dr. Edwards up until our miscarriage. We went to an ultrasound with Dr. Edwards where he told us he pregnancy wasn't viable and without what even felt like 2 minutes to recover from that news he started to discuss options for miscarriage. It felt too soon and also his super positive happy demeanor felt very at odds with having to deliver bad news. I often felt like I was bothering her when I asked questions. It's clear she was busy but also I was a patient of hers for a long time and it really never felt like we made a connection. It always felt rushed and like she was talking to a child. I work in women's health and reproductive health research, I understand a lot more because of my line of work and it still felt like she dodged some questions when I asked about more scientific or specific things. Dr. Butts is knowledgeable and well-intentioned. She is flexible, and was willing to change my plan based on new information. But either she is pulled in too many different directions or she does not have sufficient time to spend with patients. I felt like I was a burden to her through my care cycle. She would express exasperation when faced with questions - rather than viewing patient questions as an opportunity to clarify and solidify the plan, she was defensive and vague with her responses. She expressed confidence that she knew my case very well, but frequently brought up factually incorrect information related to the medications I should have been taking and my medical history. She was difficult to reach and often unavailable. She did not express compassion for miscarriages and other challenges that I faced during my time in her care. I did not feel that she truly cared about or was invested in my fertility outcomes. When we started seeing Dr. Shah we had come from another fertility clinic who told us that IVF was the only option we should consider. Instead of just moving us along to that process, Dr. Shah ordered new rounds of bloodwork and some additional tests to round our our history that the other clinic hadn't done. Once we had those results, we were presented with two options - continue trying Clomid or move onto IVF. Given our current financial situation, it was a blessing to hear that Clomid was still a viable option for us. Since that first consultation I've seen Dr. Shah twice more. Each appointment she takes the time to explain to me in very simple ways what is going on in my body and how that impacts my fertility. She's patient and willing to explain things multiple times to make sure I feel comfortable with our plan. She's the best person we could have guiding us through this process at this time. Dr. Sondheimer is very kind and compassionate. He takes the time to fully understand your story and your goals. I felt like I was very prepared for all of my procedures (HSG, IUI, egg retrieval), and knew I was in good hands. After my first miscarriage, he called multiple times to see how I was doing, both physically and mentally. I never felt like he was rushing me out of his office, and he treated me like family.Dr Butts wants me to have success. She listens to my questions/concerns/needs and has always agreed not to give up until I felt I was finished. When everything we had tried wasn’t working, she would consult with colleagues and come up with a new plan. She makes every effort to be the one to perform all of my procedures, and calls me personally to discuss any outcome or treatment plan. Dr. Masson's biggest strength is his communication. We felt like he was genuinely invested in our care and made every effort to ensure that our other fertility specialists were aware of our needs. He was compassionate and called my husband before and after each procedure. When I first went to see Dr Senapati I didn't know what to expect. She explained all the procedures such as IUI and IVF in great detail. I believe she could come off a little more compassionate as some of the other doctors I've met in the practice. She is a wonderful, honest, thorough physician and she never got frustrated with my thousands of questions. She did everything she could to explain each step of my treatments with me. She also was extremely honest with me in regards to my fertility issues and what my realistic expectations for pregnancy were. I never felt like she would push me toward something she didn’t feel would work for me. Dr. Shah is excellent at communicating what's going on. She breaks things down for ""non-science people"" and will re-explain something as much as you want. She is kind, compassionate and has been rooting for us since day 1. She is open to my concerns and suggestions (one example is that I wanted to try a natural FET instead of a medicated cycle). She explained the pros and cons of each and ultimately let me decide. This is just one example of many where she has helped me make a decision.  She was very empathetic and clearly knowledgeable. My only negative is that she was more cautious than I would have liked, after 22 cycles all negative tests- I’ve learned I would’ve like to be more aggressive a year ago. He is a caring man who has been in this field for a very long time.  He is good at direct communication, and I feel that I am in the hands of an expert.  He makes himself available as much as possible, and when he is not able to he makes sure I am in good hands with his colleagues.  He sometimes seems rushed, but he is always concentrating on me.Dr. Kalra, was great in describing you the basics of how hormones talk to ovaries, egg are produced etc. But she is not interested in listening to your concerns. She would like to push her agenda on you for treatment. I did not like her approach 
 of the way she treats her patients. She can be more compassionate.  Dr Shah is genuine and compassionate and although we rarely saw her, we felt like she was monitoring us closely from afar. She didn’t do any of my procedures and I think that played a part in feeling like a number and not a patient at this clinic. She is always very kind and took the time to answer all my questions, especially when I had bad results. I have since learned that I didn’t always get all the details I would have needed, and I think she was less inclined to think outside the box regarding m case (i.e. taking supplements, knowing my hormone levels and what those meant), but she was a great person and I think for more cut and dry cases, she is fabulous.Doctor Senapati is very good at clearly and patiently explaining things, and takes a very matter-of-fact approach. I always felt very comfortable asking questions, and she never made me feel rushed when we were discussing my care. I always felt like I had a good grasp of the steps we were taking and the reasons behind them.

The only reservation I had about her was that my husband and I chose to take a less conventional approach to IVF for religious reasons. We elected to inseminate only a small number of eggs to reduce the chances of excess embryos. We didn't feel like Dr. Senapati always fully understood how important this priority was to us, and we knew she didn't agree with our approach. In the end, we took a path we were comfortable with, but not before we experienced some (respectful) pushback.

In summary: If you've got personal ethical concerns about fertility treatments/IVF, consider another doctor who might better understand where you're coming from. If what you want is an expert walking you through your care step by step, she's a great choice.I saw Dr. Butts for general gynecology, because I knew that once I started trying to conceive I would have difficulty based on my irregular periods.  Dr Butts diagnosed me with PCOS and then continued to treat me.  When I started trying to get pregnant, I had a few (3?) IUIs with her and then she went on sabbatical.  At that time I switched to a different provider.  I found Dr Butts to be very knowledgeable, very up to date with research, and very approachable.  Had I not gotten comfortable with a different provider during her sabbatical, I would have stuck with her.My impression of Dr. Kalra is that she is incredibly smart and incredibly busy. I only saw her during consultations. All my other procedures and monitoring appointments were done by someone else (Dr, technician or resident). I did not get a ""warm and fuzzy"" vibe but, in the end, that was not the most important thing to me. I think the protocol she chose was best for me and when it did not work, she adjusted it. My initial experience with his clinic was after two subsequent miscarriages, but I had only been TTC for less than 6 months so I don't feel that my IF was taken seriously at first. After my third m/c confirmed d/t chromosomal issues my care and the attention paid to my case was greatly improved. Dr Edwards took the time to explain all of our options to us. One of my medicated cycles my CD3 labs came back with an extremely elevated FSH, and Dr Edwards called me personally to discuss the results with me.   From the beginning, Dr. Butts was rude and treated me more as if I was an annoyance than a patient.  On my first appointment, she had me wait over 1 1/2.  When I finally met with her, she didn't even apologize or acknowledge the wait.  She treated me as if I was dumb, yet was visibly annoyed when I asked her to explain anything.  She also was unwilling to give her opinion on anything and when I asked her what she thought about PGS, all she would ask was ""how do you feel about it?""  This is not a therapy session- i wanted her actual opinion.
I figured bad bedside manner would be ok if there were results.  There were not.  I have PCOS- having eggs is not my issue.  Dr. Butts cancelled my egg retrieval after 14 days of injections.  I believe I was not monitored closely enough and was given a ""cookie cutter"" cocktail of meds and not one geared towards my body.  To give you an idea, my next doctor retrieved 17 mature.  

I found out that my cycle was being cancelled after 14 days from her nurse.  Dr. Butts did not call or reach out.  After I called Dr. Butts several times, she finally called me back after hours so that when I missed her call and tried to call back, I had no way of reaching her.  When we finally did call, she showed no compassion, did not explain anything, was arrogant and was frankly annoyed that I wanted to speak to her to understand why she cancelled my cycle.  
When I called Penn and said that Dr. Butts was my dr and i wanted at least a partial refund, they were not surprised to get my call.  I can only guess that they were used to it.  I loved Dr. Kalra the first time my husband and I met her. She was kind and honest. She never sugarcoated anything, but she wasn't all doom and gloom either. I had liked my previous RE (and the main reason I switched was because IVF wasn't covered by my insurance, and Penn was far more affordable), and he was very nice. BUT he had given me false hope. He seemed certain that the IUIs would work. He even called my OB/GYN to tell him to expect to see me pregnant within the next couple of months (which did not happen). Dr. Kalra never did that. She told us our chances right up front. As I stated before, Penn was a busy place, so you would often see other doctors for procedures (all of them were excellent). Dr. Kalra did my second embryo transfer (but not my first), and that was the transfer that resulted in my beautiful baby girl. I could not have asked for a better experience with Dr. Kalra. She was knowledgeable, direct, and I always left appointments feeling like there was a plan or next step. I truly believed she cared about me as a person and was looking out for my best interest. She was trustworthy, compassionate, and just overall a wonderful person to be around during a process that is otherwise very emotionally draining.I felt comfortable with Dr. Shah immediately and felt like I was in great hands. Most of my reluctance of recommending her would only come from how Penn Medicine is run and my experience with the nurses.

Dr. Shah had a worksheet made up to help guide her conversations with her patients regarding all of the possible causes of infertility and the tests to identify them. It was incredibly thorough and helpful. I have nothing but great things to say about her. Dr. Sondhiemer is a superb physician at this clinic.  He is caring and extremely knowledgable and very methodical in his investigative process when trying to root cause infertility.  I've been under his care for 14 yrs as a routine gyn patient due to my PCOS.  He was on sabbatical when we ended up doing our retrieval and transfer but he routinely checked in with his RN to see how things were going because he wanted to make sure all was going well.  He truly cares about his patients and goes above and beyond as a physician.Sometimes he can seem rushed, but I find that asking questions gets me a long way. He's very willing to explain everything. I'm on the road to motherhood on my own and he couldn't be more supportive. He's very caring and made sure that I had a good supportive network before I started the process. I went through egg freezing a few years ago and he was great through that also. I had a good experience overall at Penn Fertility.  Dr Kalra was a great doctor. However, if you're looking to build a close relationship with your doctor this may not be the best place for you. I didn't get to do any of our IUI's or IVF transfers with her. I basically saw her at our consult appointments and when we were discussing our plans.  If you got to this practice you will end up with whatever doctor is available at the location that day. It can sometimes feel a bit impersonal.Dr Dokras seems very knowledgeable, but she is conservative (self-admitted) in her approach - both with medications/dosages and with risk factors (testing required for any existing health issues prior to IVF treatments and number of embryos transferred).  He was honest and I felt kept me prepared for a setback or a success. I felt like I always had a plan ""B"" after each visit so I never really had ""false hopes"". I also liked that he consulted with other top doctors regarding my care at Penn. He told me their opinions as well and what the plan would be moving forward. I felt like they genuinely cared whether I got pregnant and would try anything to get me there!Please see previous answer.  Dr Gracia personally performed my retrieval and transfer and was my biggest cheerleader even when I was feeling very pessimistic about my chances of success.  Dr. Gracia is optimistic, friendly, caring, approachable, funny, smart, motivated and so smart.  I always felt like my cycle and my success were very important to her.Dr Dokras obviously never remembered me. She re-introduced herself to me on several visits. I know she sees a lot of people but she could skim my chart for 5 seconds and realize I have been in her office before. Furthermore, she misdiagnosed my husband's sperm results. She opened his results in front of me and said they were normal. Two months later when I was requesting a copy of all our results, I noticed his results were not normal! These results directly impacted our treatment plan and NO ONE ever called to tell us. It is horrible that she misread the test results as I was sitting in front of her. Finally, UPenn pushes all women directly to IUI. They didn't even offer the suggestion of IUI vs. bedroom. I feel like UPenn is out to make money and they do not put the patient first.She tried her best to be at my appointments.  When she saw my name on the schedule, she requested that I wait a few minutes so she could do the fresh IVF transfer.   I didn't spend a whole lot of time with Dr. Barnhart, but when I did he was very knowledgeable and informative -- he was kind of science-y, but I liked that because we were dealing with lots of scientific info, probability, and various medical and scientific choices we had to make. So I liked him. But he isn't the warmest, fuzziest doctor, and he only did some of my procedures due to scheduling. My biggest complaint: Though we kept trying to do things and they were NOT working (2 IVFs with the same protocol), they would not try another protocol with me. They did one blanket protocol for everyone. Uniqueness was not considered. Also, 8 of my eggs ""died"" in suspicious circumstances in the lab. I had dozens more eggs they said they couldn't retrieve. And then, they did the same protocol again (no changes) and cancelled a cycle on me. My E2 levels were through the roof. Yet still, for a 3rd IVF they would have recommended no changes! It's unbelievable. There was no innovation or attempt at a new way of looking at a case. 

On the positive side, I would say Dr. Sondheimer was careful (perhaps too much so) of my health and making sure I was safe which maybe other doctors did not do enough. I also was glad that causes for recurrent pregnancy loss were explored and there was a potential blood clotting issue. Dr. K is very knowledgeable in infertility and does well in explaining it to someone new to the process. She has great bedside manner and made me feel comfortable every step of the way.  I appreciate how she's available through phone or EMR messaging and will answer in a timely manner.  Even through the phone, I feel that I'm speaking face to face with her as she has a great listening ear, validates my feelings, and answers all my questions in ways that I understand. She takes the time you need and doesn't rush through anything.He is very nice and kind. The clinic is very busy and I felt like a number. We always felt overwhelmed and needed more direction and guidance after leaving this office.  It was stressful.         ThanksMy husband was diagnosed as having azoospermia (no sperm in semen analysis) and Dr. Masson was very delicate in breaking the news. He also gave us hope by informing us that we could try vitamins, surgical sperm extraction, or look into other options for building a family (donors, adoption, etc.) . He never once made us feel embrassed or ashamed and always gave us hope.I met Dr. Scott for the first time in 2014. After I went through my first of fourth heartbreaking miscarriages. Dr. Scott gave me his time and full attention for almost 2hrs. He listened to me, held my hands and promise to help me through every process. He is very attentive, a great communicator, passionate, very pleasant and easy to talk to. He treats the whole patient. I am still waiting for my rainbow baby but I couldn’t have been under the care of a better doctor.Dr. Coutifaris is the head of Penn Fertily. He is well respected and everyone’s favorite. He is very compassionate, but at the same time professional. He had a nice sense of humor, which was very nice at such difficult times. Dr. Manigi was very kind but over confident about the success of treatment due to my age. I did not have the intended result of pregnancy. She was familiar with endometriosis but I think my case was very complicated and I'm not sure she was fully aware of how to deal with my individual situation Amazing! She is aware and sensitive to the financial costs of using donor sperm. She is optimistic that IUI will work but understand to our desire to have a baby soon; willing to compromise on the treatment plan. She is honest and caring and always available to answer question or explain something to us. She was very accommodating when my partner had to call into one of our first appointments due to a business trip.Strengths: she showed lots of compassion. She was very thorough and I appreciated that about my initial visit.  
Weak: I wish I could have spoken to her to share some of my concerns including be given the option to have an ultrasound the day of my IUI. Since I suffer from PCOS my progress has always been a little slow so I believe my IUI may have been done too early.  I did not get monitored after my IUI.  In fact, the office never called and checked on me after my IUI.  I was just instructed to call if I get a positive test.  If I don’t then I would just call on the 1st day of my cycle.  He was willing to listen to concerns and provide options for moving forward. He never pushed any one treatment.  He answered questions personally, I was never referred to a nurse for concerns. He wad very reliable and supportive. she was very nice.  she came into the clinic near the end of my treatments there.  I only moved on to another practice because the donor pool they had was much smaller than I hoped and the wait was longer.His strengths are his empathy and compassion for a very difficulty journey. He answers questions in a simple manner and during each encounter he takes his time to explain thing thoroughly. I have never felt rushed when speaking with him.Overall I was very pleased with Dr. Sondheimer's care.  He took the time to explain the process to my husband and I and made changes when necessary in order to get the best outcome.  He took time to call me to check-in to see how I was doing when we did not get the outcome we were hoping for.Dr.Kalra is very understanding and honest with all reports and options. She takes her time to go over all options during all visits. Thank Dr.Kalra for all of her services. Look forwards to continuing  my fertility treatment with this office.Dr.Barnhart is very forward with you. I think that’s what I love the most. I have a heart disease and PCOS. Other doctor werent willing to work with me. Dr.Barnhart understand my heart disease and is giving me the best treatment possible. Dr. Senapati is very dedicated, thorough, smart and clear. I always felt she was doing everything she could to ensure I made informed decisions, had good experiences, and felt supported by the practice. Her nursing team is also very supportive and helpful. I wish I did see her more but she is split between 2 offices- now that I'm in ivf monitoring I can't choose my day since it's as needed. When I do see her she's very warm and considerate. See seems really involved Dr Edwards helped our family achieve our goals. He kept us well informed, took time to explain options, risks and odds. I always felt safe in his care.  I really liked Dr. Barnhart. He had a kind way about him, and was obviously deeply involved in research as well, which I am a big fan of. I felt like he was on the cutting edge of his field. And he was very kind.  I dealt on a day-to-day basis with his nurse, Brenda, who I loved equally as much. So together, they were a great team. He is polite and educated. He takes his time to explain things . He doesn’t rush you out of his office . He will answer the same question a thousands times if needed.  He explains all options and all risk. She is incredibly caring and compassionate. I was skeptical when I changed RE practices due to insurance reasons but I feel well cared for with dr butts as my doctor. She is extremely realistic but also optimistic and has given me hope. Doctor Barnhart was very thorough with details of my condition and what we can expect. He is very friendly and truly cares about his patients. He was very open and honest with what we should expect. He answered all of my questions even if i called later with follow ups. I think Dr. Sondheimer is one of the smartest doctors in the Phila area. I would have stayed there, if I had not moved. 
Very compassionate and honest doctor. He has helped two of my friends successfully. I would recommend to any friend. Dr. Edwards tried different things with me, but I was unsuccessful. He still checks on me and is interested in my progress. Dr Kalra is compassionate but also honest.  She tells you the truth about the odds of success. She listens to all of your questions and lets you voice your concerns.the doctors were very caring in the practice but as in any high volume practice - fertility or not - there always seems to be a time crunch.  He sat with me in his office going over all of my history. He performed the ultrasound and procedure to check my tubes. When i returned with my husband he was thorough about our results and next steps

Initially, I felt like a number, but as the process continued I felt like she dealt with me more compassionately.She has called me from her personal cell number before when I was worried about a cycle and needed information and reassurance. She also called me back when she was on vacation when I was in the hospital having a preterm delivery and losing my baby at 20 weeks. She greets me with a hug when I have had a hard time or when she hasn’t seen me in a while.When my wife would go in for monitoring, she wasn't allowed to hear any results from her ultrasounds, she was told to just lie there and then wait for the results each afternoon. Blood draws were often stressful, conversations with the nurses felt impersonal and information was often unclear or left out, so that we had to do our own research and make suggestions or double-check protocols. After having two miscarriages on our own, the OBGYN pointed me towards the fertility clinic at Penn. When meeting with Dr. Kalra, she was kind and went over all aspects of tests that would be done and follow-up work that was needed. She wrote things out in a way that make it easy for a non-medical person to understand. Under her care, I went on to have two more natural miscarriages and she could not have been kinder during these times. She was compassionate and really felt for us. We have done IUI (with no pregnancies), but have not yet moved onto the IVF piece of it. Dr. Shah was very personable. She gave her full attention to my husband and I, gave us all of the information, and answered all of our questions. She even illustrated and wrote notes on paper for us.Dr Barnhart was very knowledgeable and thorough. He was kind but direct. You could tell that he was passionate about his field and he wants to get you pregnant. After my failed fresh cycle he was supportive and just as eager to try again as I was.Even if weeks -- or, in one case, months -- go by without an appointment, Dr. Mainigi always cites specific details about my experiences. She maintains eye contact the whole time rather than looking at a screen. This suggests that she both takes detailed notes after each appointment and reviews her patients' charts carefully before each appointment. I have never before had a doctor who is that detailed and prepared. Penn Fertility Care works on a group practice model, where the physicians rotate coverage for procedures, weekend coverage, etc. Despite seeing several providers for regular visits, Dr. O'Neill has gone out of her way to be my provider for significant moments in my course of treatment, even when she was not the provider-of-the-day. Also, my partner has not been able to make it to many of my appointments, but Dr. O'Neill always thinks to ask how she is doing and how we are feeling in the fertility care process.Dr. Butts took the time to review my complicated medical history, including ovarian cyst removal surgery, prior to developing my individualized treatment plan. She was always focused on the details of my specific case rather than treating me with a generic standard protocol and approach to treatment.Dr. Edwards was always warm and positive. He often ran late for his appointments but also took as much time as you needed with him once you were in the office with him. I appreciated his optimism and generally jolly demeanor. Dr. Kalra was thorough but we never felt she was warm or like she really had time for us. If I had a question that required speaking to her, I often felt like I was bothering her. She also sprung the need for ICSI on us on the morning of my retrieval (while I was gowned up and waiting for my IV placement) and it didn't really feel like she took the time to explain why she changed her mind. Dr. Butts did not spend time getting to know me. She had poor knowledge of my medical history, and in communications would recount factually incorrect information about my history, my current medications, and my plan. Dr. Shah and the team at UPenn Radnor knows me by name and always refers to me in that way during appointments. Additionally, they know that we drive over an hour each way to our appointments and make every effort to give me the first appointment slot so that my work day isn't interrupted significantly. They are reassuring and answer even some of the simplest of questions. Dr. Sondheimer and his nurse would personally call me back when I called with questions. He was so incredibly kind, especially after my first miscarriage, which was before I was in treatment with him. When I had to leave the practice due to insurance changes and a move out of the area, he called to tell me that he would always be there to support me in what I needed, and that he would love to keep in touch about life, good news, and my professional career (I'm a physician). I never felt rushed with him, and he made sure I felt cared for at a very vulnerable time in my life.I was always called by my doctor or my nurse with results, instructions, etc. They always made me feel like they were taking a personal interest in my case. Dr. Masson was very thorough and honest about our prognosis. He answered all of our questions and we never left appointments feeling confused or unsure of what to expect. We never had a hard time getting a hold of him directly and he called my husband numerous times regarding procedures, appointments, etc. I wish all of our doctors communicated like he does!Dr Senapati explained the entire process in great detail. If you have a question, my nurses got back to me the same day. When I went in to see my doctor or for blood work and sonogram I was seen within 15-20 minutes. All staff is very friendly and willing to answer any questions. My doctor and the clinic always made me feel like my feelings, questions and requests were extremely important. I never felt like I was a number in Dr. Shah’s eyes!Please note that many of the nurses mentioned in other reviews are no longer at Penn. There have been a few wonderful new nurses (Christine and Dawn) who are excellent at relaying information, call back promptly and are kind and compassionate. Whenever I am there, everyone say hello to me and remembers me. I can reach Dr. Shah whenever I want to speak with her directly. Dr. Shah was very kind and very honest. She recognized how hard this is and always tried to remain positive but gave us her honest opinions. The practice itself can be a little overwhelming, in terms of the number of patients and providers-- so in that way sometimes I feel like a number.  But Dr. Sondheimer puts a lot of personal thought into every stage of care, and is both flexible and direct with his opinions.  I truly feel like he cares, even though I haven't yet become pregnant.In the beginning when I consulted her for irregular periods and not getting pregnant, she quickly jumped to conclusion that I had PCOS. Later after my blood work hormones results came, she changed her initial diagnosis to DOR (I had low AMH). She did not went further in understanding the root cause of my irregular periods and wanted to start Clomid asap. I did 3 cycles of Clomid with timed intercourse. During all 3 cycles, I was seen by her junior staff and she never contacted me and talked about the failed cycles or trying other medications. After 3 Clomid cycles, she directly wanted to jump to IVF  and when I told her that I would need more time, she lost all her interest in me. It felt as if she was trying to push me to do IVF and when I pushed back, she was not amused. After 6 months, I went back to her to get opinion on what next steps we should take to get pregnant, she was not interested at all to take our case owing it to loss AMH and importantly we went for a second opinion to another doctor (which she did not liked). In my opinion she took things personally, rather then helping her patient in getting pregnant. Also I felt like a number, she had no good bed side manners. 
Dr Shah was compassionate and I really felt that she was invested in our care. She called us whenever we got bad news and to give her best wishes when we decided to switch clinics. We didn’t get the outcome we had hoped for so we were eager to get some new ideas by switching clinics, but leaving Dr Shah was bittersweet.She always remembered me and spoke to me kindly even if it had been a while since I saw her, and even when the news wasn’t good.Penn Fertility Care is a huge, efficient practice. Almost everyone I encountered was very warm and kind, but it did mean that almost every visit involved a different practitioner who wasn't familiar with me and my history. My doctor was always available to me by phone, and I knew she was always making the key decisions about my care, but I seldom saw her in person. The biggest downside is that occasionally someone would communicate inaccurate or inconsistent information to me, so I really had to be on top of my own care and advocate for myself, which could get tiring.

Overall, I was comfortable with Penn Fertility Care because I trusted that they had the best resources and expertise available, but someone who would be bothered by the level of personal attention might want to consider a smaller practice.The office has set times for monitoring appointments and a protocol that is rather inflexible. Except for specific consultations, you see whoever is free that day. I also felt that most appointments were rushed. At times at our consults Dr Edwards had to refresh himself on our info and history during the appt, so you definitely want to be well versed on your history and lab results when you go in. After my last miscarriage he called me personally to see how I was doing which was greatly appreciated. Dr Butts made me wait over an hour each time I met her.  When I would see her in the clinic when I was there for bloods or ultrasounds, she would walk right by and had no idea who I was- not even a smile or tilt of the head in acknowledgment.  In appointments, she clearly did not recall any details about me.Penn Medicine is a very busy place - far busier than the fertility clinic I went to previously. Yet, despite that, everyone I dealt with treated me so well that I never felt like a number. They were kind and compassionate, and they always listened to me. I honestly received excellent care there. While Penn Fertility is a larger clinic, Dr. Kalra always took her time during my appointments and made sure my husband and I were comfortable with each step during the process. Dr. Shah is warm, straightforward, and whip-smart. She goes over things in as little or as much detail as you are comfortable with. He spent a vast amount of time counseling me and my husband, praising our strength and courage, and supporting us throughout the entire process.Even though I see someone different all the time through the fertility process, I know Dr Sondheimer is leading my team an available whenever I need him to be. He is straight forward and honest; I also find him to be warm and understanding. He lets me know that I'm the one in control and I ultimately make the decisions. The nurses are wonderful!!! I am (trying to be) a single mom by choice and not only is Dr Sondheimer supportive, the staff is also pulling for me every step of the way. Dr Dokras always asked how we felt about our options or next steps that we just discussed and if we were comfortable with them before ending the appointments.Dr. Sondheimer and his nurse, Rie were incredible throughout  my journey. He personally called me back with answers to questions.Dr Gracia (please note it is Gracia, not Garcia) is one of the most fantastic doctors (and people) I've ever met.  She's unfailingly positive and so invested in her patients' outcomes.  I had a poor prognosis per my ob/gyn and all my test results and she remained encouraging and optimistic every step of the way.  She listened to my concerns and answered all of my questions.  She came to the office on a weekend (on a day she was not scheduled to be in the office) to personally perform my egg retrieval and transfer.  I really didn't expect my cycle to work at all but it not only worked, it worked on the first try and I have twins!!  She is the best!Dr Dokras spent very little time with me on my first visits. She made zero effort to connect with me as a person and I felt like she was a robot just asking me questions and putting them into her EMR system. She never hesitated to hug me when I needed one, and didn't blink when I cried.  And I cried pretty much every visit.  She focused on moving forward rather than my fears of ""what if"".  She was positive without being bullshitting me.The nurse accessibility and care was very good. -- there are a lot of doctors in the practice, and I really liked pretty much all of them, but not a ton of consistency in who you saw, it just depended on the day you went in. At no point did I feel like a number rather than a human even though they clearly had a ""process"" but that made it more efficient I thought.He didn't seem to know my case very well or seem personally invested. Long waits, often didn't even see him though he was coordinating my care. Dr. K was great with me and my partner coming in for consultation about starting our family. She was warm but honest and very informative about what our steps were to start the process. She's available through phone and through chart messaging and answers in a timely manner. The clinic is large and unorganized. It was a confusing start to an overwhelming process. The staff was nice, but I felt rushed in and out. They didn’t take much time to explain the process or plan. I felt the NP specifically was cold and quick to tell us things. They often weren’t thorough and I felt I needed to really watch my own treatment plan so things weren’t missed. I hated it Dr. Masson was very sincere and expressed great empathy toward my husband and I during this difficult time. Dr. Scott is always personable encouraging, optimistic and value my opinion and input. He treats my partner and I with a great deal of respect and compassion. Dr. Coutifaris is a very caring person. He is also very well educated and he was activiely looking for options. Unfortunately, he ended up taking sabbatical and I had to choose a different doctor. Dr. Manigi was pleasant and cared about my goalsAlways available to talk about steps, what to expect, when to change courses, and answer general questions.Dr. Shah spoke with compassion.  She was very informative.Very kind and always personally responded to calls ad questions His personality is very warm and inviting making it easier to ask questions. Dr. Sondheimer always took his time when speaking to myself and my husband.  He genuinely seemed to care about our process and outcomes.They always call you by your name. They have everything in order before speaking with you they review your whole file. They know what’s going on with your medical history.Dr. Senapati always took time to clearly and thoroughly explain everything. She answered all my questions and even suggested and answered questions I didn't even think to ask. I felt she cared about my experience and outcomes.She is always warm, always remembers me: I do see her when I'm there but usually half the appts Dr Edwards explained our situation and options throughout the process. He was compassionate but remained extremely professional. I felt safe, well informed and educated. He provided us the information we needed to make good decisions, based on our needs/goals. I had a very good personal relationship with my nurse, Brenda, who kept me up-to-date daily or whenever I had questions. Dr. Barnhart and the whole team at Penn Fertility care or wonderful. They did seem to know the details about my case, and we're always available to answer questions when needed. They were also very helpful with the financial aspects of our situation.  Overall, it was a great team! From first impression he was very nice and polite . He took time to listen to my journey and answered all questions . I like him . Dr butts is extremely caring and compassionate. Penn staff was very good. Every doctor in the practice knew exactly what you were there for. They were gentle and kind and knew you were going through something stressful, and managed things appropriately. ",7.900000000000003,8.300000000000002,"Samantha Butts was recommended to me by my GYN. She is understanding of the financial pressures of using donor sperm and makes sure my wife and I are fully on board with the plan at each step of the process. I have since learned that I didn’t always get all the details I would have needed, and I think she was less inclined to think outside the box regarding m case (i.e. taking supplements, knowing my hormone levels and what those meant), but she was a great person and I think for more cut and dry cases, she is fabulous. My impression of Dr. Kalra is that she is incredibly smart and incredibly busy. I didn't spend a whole lot of time with Dr. Barnhart, but when I did he was very knowledgeable and informative -- he was kind of science-y, but I liked that because we were dealing with lots of scientific info, probability, and various medical and scientific choices we had to make. But he isn't the warmest, fuzziest doctor, and he only did some of my procedures due to scheduling. I wish I did see her more but she is split between 2 offices- now that I'm in ivf monitoring I can't choose my day since it's as needed. He was very open and honest with what we should expect. During all 3 cycles, I was seen by her junior staff and she never contacted me and talked about the failed cycles or trying other medications."
78,University of Pennsylvania Penn Fertility Care,advice,"At the initial onset and throughout the process, as needed, express to her your communication needs.She is a great RE and has always made me feel that she cared about my treatment and wanted me to have a baby.  Be educated and direct about what you would like to try and she is often receptive. Choose Dr Shah because you're looking for a safe, researched-based practice that won't be aggressive and make sure you speak up and advocate for your own needs.  I think it is important to ask questions. While she explained everything to us, asking for clarification or more detail can be very important. Often it is very emotional and overwhelming when receiving all of the details, so come prepared with questions! My advice to anyone would be to be prepared with questions. Plan on having some testing done after the consultation as well. We had our consultation, then had blood work, genetic testing, and an ultrasound all in her office minutes after the visit.Know that he isn’t a fluffy guy, he is matter of fact and to the point which I appreciateProvide her with as many details as possible, as she takes everything into consideration when creating an individualized plan. She's also incredibly honest and communicative, so you'll get thorough answers to your questions. Be open and honest about your needs and desires, and never shy away from asking questions about your treatment. Dr. O'Neill will truly partner with you in this process.As with any doctor, develop a list of questions and feel free to ask for explanations as often necessary. As a difficult to manage case, I had many concerns along the way, but Dr. Butts was always responsive and able to provide answers to my questions. Dr. Edwards is very much a cheerleader however we had to pursue asking a lot of questions and ask about options for what to change when we had multiple transfers with either no result or chemical pregnancy, he was find just keeping doing what we were doing without adjusting anything to help improve outcomes. Finally after we asked if there was anything that could be changed he brought up some other options. You might want to wok with Dr. Kalra is you really don't want anything sugar-coated. We found her bedside manner to be cold and not sympathetic for two people who are trying to keep hope alive after a lot of failure and much heartache. Ultimately, this is why I asked to be reassigned to another doctor within the practice. I would recommend for patients of Dr. Butts to be prepared to advocate for themselves. It took us over a month between when we initially called for an appointment and when we were able to schedule one, so I'd consider calling early. I also don't see her at every appointment, but have been able to (and encouraged by the nurses) schedule other appointments with her if I need to.Ask every question you have! Write them down and take your list with you. He will take all the time he needs to answer them. Try to research everything you can to find out what’s going on with your body. And don’t be afraid to have opinions or suggestions and stick up for yourself if you feel something isn’t right. Don't be afraid to call his office to speak to him directly! His office staff was great about helping us get in touch with him. Dr Senapati throws a lot of information at you at once. Make sure you bring your questions and you take down notes. Come prepared with your questions and have an understanding of the process. I feel like having a handle on things and knowing what to ask shows that you are ready to make informed decisions and that you are completely invested in the process.  She will explain and re-explain anything you don’t understand. She will give you realistic expectations and she will guide you toward the best options for your specific situation!Be prepared to acknowledge that the office is run much differently than most other clinics because UPenn is a teaching hospital. Once I figured this out, it became much less stressful. You will be on hold a lot. You might have to follow-up with the nursing staff. If you miss a call, it's a huge pain to get the team back on the line. Having said that, Dr. Shah ALWAYS called me back in the same day that I asked to talk directly to her and there is ALWAYS an on-call doctor that you can reach (even at 3am). You just have to know that Dr. Shah is managing your care and that every single doctor at UPenn is fantastic, as well. I never had concerns about my care, it was just annoying the way their communication system is.  She will do whatever you choose - so push if you feel like you’re not being aggressive enough with your treatment. Ask all your questions, even the very minute details.  And be prepared to not see him all the time.She is doctor who runs by numbers, I mean that they want to have good success rates and will take only patients that they think will have better IVF success rates. So if you have DOR, other complications, I will suggest to stay away for her. She will not ask you to do some tests like HSG, hystroscopy etc which at times could be helpful in diagnosing the problem and prevent you from going towards IVF. As I said she wants to IVF and for that she doesnot need fallopian tubes and uterus etc. So stay away from her practice if you want to find diagnosis to your infertility/DOR.Trust her and don’t be afraid to ask questions! Read up about infertility before you go in and ask her all the questions you have regarding things like antral follicle count, hormone levels, etc., so you can track them and also understand where you fit. Chances are she has the info but she doesn’t always share it unless you ask.Don't hesitate to ask questions at any point! She's going to explain a TON of information to you, which can quickly get overwhelming and make decisions difficult. So ask about anything that's unclear, and request to go over something again if you didn't fully grasp it the first time. She'll never make you feel dumb for asking more questions.She can be a quick talker, so be sure to write down all your questions to be sure that you fit them all in.  She'll spend as much time with you as you need.Come prepared with all your questions because she is impossible to reach outside of specific office visits. Educate yourself as much as possible and bring notes and your previous labs results to your consults. find a new Dr. immediately.If you are concerned about a recommendation or how treatment is going, don't hesitate to call Dr. Kalra to discuss it with her. Someone else may deliver the news, but you are always welcome to talk it over with her to make sure you're making the right decision or doing what's best for you.Ask questions. She was always willing to take extra time with me if I had more questions or wanted to talk anything through.Be aware that Penn Medicine acts a bit like a team and even if Dr. Shah is your primary RE and guiding your care, you will see any of the doctors at a given procedure and no doctor at all during your monitoring.He can be very straightforward, but not in a blunt manner.Ask questions!!! Ask as many questions as you need and do you own research, but trust your doctor while in the middle of treatment - they do have a plan even if you don't understand all aspects of it!Ask a lot of questions and request to see him at major appointments. If you aren't comfortable seeing other doctors or fellows, this might not be the practice for you.Take notes, she talks fast!Request a hard copy of all your results. Do not trust the verbal diagnosis. She is great.  However, you need to be aware of how Penn Fertility operates.  If you're looking for a warm and fuzzy doctor with a communicative bedside manner, he's probably not your doc. However, if you're interested in someone who knows the latest research, is really into statistics and facts, and has seen the latest treatments and tons of patients, that's his specialty (in my mind). I spent a lot more time in his personal office than I did in a patient/clinical room.If you are a basic, straightforward patient, he may be fine (I did get pregnant twice on IUI's though lost those) but if your case is unusual or out of the normal scope, this is not the office for you. You will enjoy her as a Dr.Make sure you ask lots of questions and feel comfortable that your doctor will be overseeing your case. You need to trust your doctor, whoever you choose, for this overwhelming process. Ask questions. Dr.Masson is great, I would highly recommend him.Be honest with yourself. Trust Dr. Scott’s plan and protocol.I would give this advise to every patient no matter how good their doctor is - be your own advocate and don’t accept no for an answer. Ask a lot of questions about your treatment plan and next steps in the event treatment doesn't help Listen to Dr. Kalra and believe that she has your best interest in mind. The process can be very overwhelming and emotional.You may only see your doctor once and that’s itBe honest about your needs,  expectations and ask questions. He's very willing to help you in whichever ways you think will be best for you. Don't be afraid to ask questions.Ask questions.Dr.Kalra is very kind and understanding. She will assist you with whatever your concern may be.He knows what he is doing. Just isn’t that heart warming, but if you are looking for someone very true and  forward he is your guy. Trust the process.To trust your dr. I think a ton of people try to dictate their treatments.. doctors know best and if they are taking a slow approach it's for a reason Be your own advocate. Don't be afraid to ask questions.  He's probably a little bit more research-oriented than some doctors. But very kind, and with a nice manner. Pick Dr. Barnhart as your Doctor . She would treat you as if you are her family member. She's very invested in your fertility journey. ask questions, and listen carefully. Be your best advocate with any doctor out there.

79,University of Pennsylvania Penn Fertility Care,nurse,"Nurse Nia was very compassionate and respectable. Always checking in on patients and making sure they are receiving all necessary medication as well as being prepared for each procedures or testing.Great communicator, always on top of things, very compassionate.The nurses always got back to me when I called with a question. I felt they were more compassionate and understanding than the doctors. Beth was excellent. She always returned my calls and answered all my dumb questions. She made sure I was clear with everything. And everyone else who assisted was fantastic as well.You are assigned a nurse at the clinic. My nurse was fantastic. She always called when she said we would. She spoke slowly and made sure that I always understood the directions and doses during stims. Roohi always called me back promptly whenever I had a question.  Ugh, Julie and I just didn't emotional mesh.  If I had a different nurse during the ultrasound, she would leave me feeling positive.  But when Julie would call in the afternoon with my blood results and instructions, she left me feeling hopeless and like the other nurse had lied to me.  No one lied to me, Julie was just not as empathetic.  She also neglected to call in a very important prescription med, which resulted in hysterical crying on my part, frantic calls to a late night pharmacy and an hCG trigger shot in the bathroom of the pharmacy.  I had a miscarriage early in my treatment with Penn and needed to have my hCG levels repeatedly drawn.  Julie called me and excitedly told me ""You're very pregnant"" not realizing earlier that day we were told there wasn't a heartbeat.  I think that was what colored my feelings toward Julie.The nurses have been great.  The nurses I worked with directly were always very prompt at returning calls/messages and extremely helpful.Very carrying. Returns calls right away or same day. Which I love I loved Erin and the nursing staff that supported me throughout my fertility processes. I spoke with Erin more than any doctor or anyone else at the clinic during my IVF cycle and she was absolutely wonderful.Her availability when I had any sort of questions whatsoever.She was so kind and gentle. She made her self available. 
The only flaw in the process was explaining sub-contanius injections Very caring. Took my case personally. I have her cell phone and can text her if I need to. She is my advocate. My nurse was wonderful. She answered my questions throughly and those she could not answer she referred to the RE. She was very accessible via telephone and the portal. She performed demonstrations on how to administer the medications and she was present for lining checks and egg counts/progression checks.Brenda treated me well and was willing to listen to my concerns. She also helped me to figure out the most cost effective way to purchase my medications.Our main nurse was not empathetic, especially when she had bad news to share. She was very laid back about details (e.g., suggesting we come in to get a written plan *after* the protocol & medications began). She could be hard to get in touch with and did not always seem to know the answers to critical questions we asked about what to do at various points in the protocol   The nurse was just as nice and knowledgable as Dr. Shah. She explained everything thoroughly and provided me with her direct number. Demaree is an ANGEL. I would have been lost with out her. She is compassionate, smart and organized. She managed my care and appointments and listened to me. I never felt like I was bothering her and I truly felt like she was in this with me ! The nursing staff have all been wonderful. They've provided thorough answers to my questions and always respond very quickly when I reach out via the online messaging system. Amy has been available to answer any questions along the way and to clarify timing for treatments. Any questions she cannot answer she passes up the chain to Dr. O'Neill.Amy was very compassionate. Whenever she would call with results she would focus on the positive “growth is happening!” and “don’t worry, we will get some eggs this time” which I needed at times when I feared the treatment would not work on me as a poor responder. I worked primarily with Dawn during the course of my treatment. Up until the end she was very helpful. Every time there was a negative result, she was right there working with me to schedule a follow up, and keep on the horse for next time. The main issue is take is that after my last transfer (which did result in positive rising HCG levels) but ultimately ended in miscarriage after the 6-week ultrasound, Dawn knew we didn't have any embryos left and also knew we weren't in a position to continue with more treatment at that time (after 6 IUIs, 2 retrievals and 6 transfers). The day we found out at the ultrasound that it wasn't viable I emailed later saying we were going to wait and see if the miscarriage would happen naturally but also asked her to check on the insurance coverage for the anesthesia for a D&C. She did not answer my email. 2 weeks later I finally followed to up to say that it had happened and i was fine. She responded that my message must have been lost by the surgical team and that was it. No sympathy, no apology for not responding and certainly no push to come back in for another follow up. That really made me feel like a major dollar sign (or lack there of) with Penn Fertility Care and one of the main reasons I would never recommend them to anyone looking for care in Philly. Susan is the NP who is the primary on my case. She's just fantastic - even though we're in our sixth round of Clomid treatment, she has walked me through the steps every time and hasn't assumed I know what to do because I've done it before. She returns my phone calls within the same day and even at appointments where I'm in and out of the office before she comes in, she still calls me in the same day to check in and make sure I'm feeling ok with where things are. Madeline was the best! She fully explained everything and called me daily with updates to my medications and treatment plans. The rest of the nurses with whom I interacted in the office were also great. They were all very friendly and helpful.I would receive update phone calls from my nurse Dawn whenever Dr Butts was unable to call me herself. She was conscious of the hours I worked and always called at a reasonable time. She knew I wanted all the details and results of any tests or labs done. She was able to answer any questions I had and was knowledgeable about my case throughout the process. My nurse Madeline was excellent. She showed me and my husband how to take the shots during our consultation. Madeline called me every evening to tell me my levels, what dose of medicine to take and how my follicles were progressing. After my eggs were retrieved she called and gave me updates. Always willing to listen, respectful, knowledgeable and caring!!  They all go above and beyond the call of duty. I love the staff at Penn. Going through this for as long as I have, seeing the girls (Angie, Susan, Aleah) is nice. They’re familiar. They’re professional. They make me feel safe in a very hard situation. She always calls me when she says she will, and always answers all of my questions.  I feel I am in good hands.The NP assigned to us was the least compassionate human being I’ve ever met. She was very negative and made the whole IVF process near unbearable. Every time I asked that something be submitted to insurance, she gave me a snarky response about they would never cover it. She acted like I was an inconvenience to her daily. Always very nice/compassionate, but also seemed very rushed any time we spoke on the phone, which is usually when I had questions. Erin is great at explaining things and demonstrating medication protocols in a way I could understand. Overall, the nursing staff at Penn Fertility Care made me feel very comfortable and taken care of.Erin is very attentive and informative. Returns calls in a timely manner. The only negative I have is that I have noticed a correlation in that when lab results are not ideal (e.g. an inappropriately rising, or falling beta) the call with the results comes later in the day than a call with good news lab results does. nice enough but dr butts threw her under the bus.  forgot to order my meds when i was supposed to startThe entire nursing staff was so wonderful through the whole process. Erin always called me on time and when she said she would, and took time to answer any questions I had.While I liked the other staff in the clinic, I didn't like either of the main nurses at Penn Radnor, Julie or Beth. Julie was my coordinator and she just doesn't have a lot of patience and was frequently confusing. When I was trying to confirm one set of her instructions early on, she made a snarky remark that she had done this many times. I replied back that I hadn't and wanted to make sure that I understood. She sounds condescending on the phone and ordered medications that I didn't need without warning me that I didn't need to pick them up right away (that they were only ""in case of"").
I would see Beth sometimes during monitoring and I felt as though she was withholding information (probably bad news). She was not my primary contact, however, so my experience with her was minimal.Rie is fantastic.  She always ensured I was comfortable and understood everything.  She returns phone calls promptly and spends as much time needed to explain things and a set questions.  She personally calls to check in and even to follow up after her weekend off if you had anything done during that time.  She came down to check on me after my retrieval as well, even though she wasn't in the OR and was in the office that day.Ree is like having the sweetest Mom or Grandmom by your side. I can't say enough nice things about her. She is the mellow calming force to the whole process. The rest of the nurses have been super supportive and caring through the whole process. They know me and even if they aren't part of my
care that day they always ask how I'm doing and wish me luck. Rie was incredible. She listened to my 100s of questions, was always calm and assuring and kept me so prepared. She was an angel!Roohi was very calm and caring.  She was very organized about all the steps in the process.  She had my medications ordered and the prior authorizations completed in advance.  She was very supportive throughout the processI liked my RN, Beth, and the other RNs that i spoke with. They were more willing to answer questions and explain things than Dr Dokras. They seemed to be the only ones understanding my care. Brenda was efficient and available. Sometimes I felt that she was a little overwhelmed with having a lot of work, and a couple of times I wasn't sure she quite remembered the specifics of my case. But she was always available when I needed her and I really appreciated her letting me text her. I would have random questions about this or that and she was very patient with me in answering them and always answered quickly. That helped me so much because I didn't have to pick up the phone and call her every single time.I remember she had to give me a Rhogam shot and do betas with me and it was an awful time and she was so kind to me. The staff is overwhelmed with too many patients to honestly spend the time needed on each individual so you feel like a person who is being thoroughly cared for Erin is very knowledgeable, resourceful, compassionate and an over all great nurse. She call you back when she says she’s going to. I think she gets burn out at time My nurse takes me very seriously. I have had three doctors and the only constant is my nurse. She knows me well and I know she has my best interest at heart. They are excellent. No one judged our relationship status or desire to expand our family. Everyone on the team is compassionate and optimistic for you! It's like having an extra 3-4 people crossing their fingers every month.Strengths:  very detailed and showed compassion 
Weakness:  at times it was difficult to speak to herThey remember you and get very involved with you. You feel like you're their only patient She was funny and polite . Some of the other staff didn’t return my call timely and I didn’t like that.",7.900000000000003,8.300000000000002,"Nurse Nia was very compassionate and respectable.

80,University of Pennsylvania Penn Fertility Care,clinic,"The Penn fertility nursing staff is highly variable. Some are very organized and compassionate, but mistakes occurred because different nurses will call with results and not have an understanding of specific cases. I frequently had to chase down results and information. One time I drove out for an hour to a specialty pharmacy just to find out that the prescription had not been sent in. These issues are due to organizational challenges around care coordination. Nursing staff was very welcoming and helped answer any questions I had. They made me feel very comfortable in a very personal situation.IA strength and weakness was size.  I was very comfortable there and liked the dotors.  However, I wanted to move quickly and the donor pool was much smaller than needed.  I didn't want to leave the dpctors but needed to to move ahead in my treat,entThe clinic is very well-mannered and asks if their anyway they can assist you while waiting to see the doctors. Sometimes they can be a bit busy and don't have time to spark a conversation. Most of the time they too, make sure you leave with an updated appointment or notes from the doctors. Thank you for your services.One of the main reasons I Stayed at Penn was because of the wonderful nursing staff, especially N.P., Kelly Lee. Had Kelly not stepped in and reviewed my chart, I most likely would have sought out a second opinion. The nurses are great and call with results and are so nice and answer any questions you may have! I cant say enough about the nurses here. Penn Medicine has multiple locations which is nice and you can go to any of them. My primary location usually ran pretty well on schedule for blood work/ultrasound appointments in the morning when prepping for egg retrieval or IUI. The space was light and bright and always clean. 

The downsides are that many of their staff need to be trained with regard to compassion. The financial person was extremely condescending and really didn't seem like she understood how emotional the infertility experience can be. She didn't respond in a timely manner, didn't get an IUI request submitted on time causing us to have to cancel and generally wasn't very nice. Additionally, there as never any discussion of mental health, how I was feeling or any suggestion for counseling. I was lucky enough to already being care with a trusted provider but many people are not and that should have been discussed. Penn Fertility will always have a lot of patients because some large employers in the Philadelphia area cover services there. It is a well-respected program and most of the physicians I interacted with are excellent. However, the clinic does not care at all about patient satisfaction or patient experience. The financial coordinators are particularly difficult to work with - they are rude, don't return calls, and are unwilling to help unless they are chasing you down for a bill. If this clinic is the only one covered by your insurance, you will likely get what you need. But if you are paying out of pocket, I would think about going elsewhere. Though we were happy with our doctors, we were not happy with the clinic as a whole and have since left the clinic. We felt that we rarely saw our doctor. In over a year Penn Fertility Care, we saw our official IVF doctor maybe three or four times total, including consultations.the Penn nursing staff is great for bloodwork and US. you receive call about your resultsIt can feel a bit like a factory, just with the number of providers and patients.  But I liked all the providers very much, and trusted their communication with me and with each other.  I also have a lot of trust in the Penn medical system.  If you need a lot of personal attention from your primary physician this probably isn't a good place for you-- but if you can handle having many providers, with your primary driving the decisions, it's great.The clinic has weekend hours which are great. I wish there was more flexibility with monitoring appointments. Having them in the morning only at a certain time is inconvenient if you don't have a traditional 9-5. I have also experienced incredible wait times for appointments. For instance, I was told to show up with a FULL bladder for an IUI and ended up waiting an hour for the procedure. Also, we had a lot of trouble with the financial department in getting set up for IVF. No one would call us back and when they did we got different answers. To this day, we do not know what it will cost us up front or in total. You will receive excellent care here. It's a busy place, busier than the first clinic I went to, but there's a reason for that! Affordable great care. So you may have to wait a bit at each visit. Fortunately my work was understanding if I was late, but I know this could be an issue for some people.Like I said previously, the clinic may leave you feeling like you don't have a personal relationship with your doctor.  However when I did have appointments with Dr. Kalra I always left feeling confident in our plan and next step.  She communicated great and listened and was concerned with how you were dealing with everything mentally as well.  They were prompt with the early morning monitoring appointments. The staff was friendly.Wait times for appointments can vary anywhere from 5 to 45 minutes.  The staff have always been very apologetic if the wait time was on the longer side.  Front desk staff have always been polite and pleasant.Monitoring appointments were all in the mornings which was convenient for me.  The earliest appointment was at 7:45 so I was able to be in, out and at work almost on time.  Thankfully my job had some flexibility.Clinic was clean and well organized. I didn't wait too long either. They have plenty of openings, it just depends which location you're trying to go to. I appreciated how they greeted me, as if I've been there a thousand times before and they knew me.  The nurses were very compassionate. They also were easy to get in touch with.Nursing staff were kind but overwhelmed and could not provide individual careEveryone was helpful and compassionate  Nurses here seemed very informed about the trying to conceive language and seemed empathic toward patients.The one weakness I found was the responsiveness on the weekends as there were a few times I never received a call back from the on call staff even though I called various times.  The strength is that the clinic was flexible for appointments.Wish they had a closer clinic to me. I drive an hour to get to the office. It’s in the city so I always have to pay for parking. So far this has been the best office. Looking forward to continue my treatment. The clinic seemed genuinely concerned with ensuring I had a good experience. Wait times weren't always short but they weren't terrible, and were quite good if you went first thing in the morning. The desk staff who checked me in each time were particularly lovely.Sometimes I feel like a number and I have to stay very on top of things to get calls back etc. Very caring and advanced. My concern that they don’t do an overall holistic personalized testing. I am still unexplained after being with them for over 2.5 years. They have helped two of my friends and my friends are very happy with the care they received. The clinic is very organized. The ambiance of the waiting room is not intimidating; it’s like any other Dr’s office. The staff is helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable.  If you park in the garage, bring your parking ticket and they can validate it for you.Penn Fertility is competent, caring and responsive when there is a concern.  They can be a less aggressive than I would prefer in their approach at times but can usually be convinced to try something when pushed.The clinic is often fairly quiet and pretty efficient. There's free parking, although the lot is very busy/tight after the very early morning. All procedures must be done at the downtown office and procedures are done by whoever is on-call/working that day, not by your doctor.  The nurses at the front desk never learn your name or get to know you. There are no discounts for procedures. I wish that they knew that while Penn has great nurses and doctors, some of their processes are delayed. Sometimes you need to pursue them for test results. I just think that when you'e involved in fertility treatments, communication is key, and perhaps Penn could be a little better. 

All of the staff is great, even when trying to get appointments. Kind and compassionate and helpful! The clinic’s strengths would be their location, cleanliness, and assess to other care. The clinic is located in a health campus with other offices, a lab, and radiology department. They do not do surgery there, so the egg retrieval would have to happen in downtown Philadelphia. the Clinic has early hours they are fast and efficient and the office is clean. I go to the market st location so it is a little annoying having to park but they do validate your parking which is nice. Strengths: Incredible staff, limited wait times, and lots of transparency about procedures and associated costs. Weaknesses: This is an issue with fertility treatments generally, but the only weakness I can find is the cost of treatment. Much of that is related to my insurance rather than to this clinic. IUIs with Clomid cost $1000, IUIs with injections (which I have not had) cost $2000, and a round of IVF is $8000. This is relatively comparable to the costs I've seen at other clinics in this area with the exception of the IUI, which seems to be a bit pricier than other clinics nearby. Clinic runs very efficiently for monitoring appointments in the morning. It would be nice if they had even earlier monitoring appointments available since so many of their patients work in healthcare fields and are likewise expected to be at work at 7 am. All of the clinical staff have been appropriate regarding our care as a same-sex couple, but some of the front desk employees consistently ask after ""my husband"" when I check in for appointments. One thing to be aware of is that children are allowed in the waiting area, which is understandable for couples trying to conceive a subsequent child, but can be painful for those of us struggling to conceive our first.Penn is a busy clinic. Because of that there is a whole team involved in your care and you may not see the same doctor for every appointment or procedure. I had two other doctors for two of my retrievals,and both were excellent. One weakness, if I had to name one, was that it was rather difficult obtaining medical records when they were requested from the office. They outsource to a company called MRO, but this company did not send the complete records that I had requested. The positives of Penn is that if you work there, the insurance coverage is fantastic. We received 6 covered IUIs, 2 retrievals and three transfers all through my insurance plan. They also have several locations and you can go to any one you want depending on whats most convenient for you. Most of the time, for the early morning blood draw/ultrasound visits leading up to IUI or retrieval, they are mostly on time. 

On the other side of the coin, the process for getting ""bad news"" isn't great. Usually the ultrasound tech just says everything is fine but if it's not then they literally don't say anything and on the way out say ""the doctor will come in and speak to you."" It just was very anxiety provoking. Maybe this is true of all clinics, I don't know, but I really didn't like how it was handled. Additionally, the weekend appointments sometimes ran 90 minutes behind for a simple blood draw and/or ultrasound. I also very much felt like a dollar sign. The financial person was entirely unprofessional and had no empathy at all for us. Even though we had mailed a check which had not yet been received she basically threatened to cancel our embryo transfer if we didn't pay the bill for our embryo storage. We had literally received the bill earlier that week and mailing a check was the only option for payment. It wasn't an issue with being able to pay or not wanting to pay - they just literally hadn't received it yet. I never really felt connected to my care team or like anyone really cared about us (for the most part) and I was under their care for almost 3 years. Monitoring appointments were convenient with relatively short wait times. What I appreciate most about UPenn is that they are a teaching hospital. One of the first things that Dr. Shah said to us is that she will never push us to the most invasive - and often most expensive - treatment plan. Because they are a teaching and research hospital, there is benefit in moving through each prescribed option and trying things multiple times. It has resulted in a longer amount of time that we've been in treatment, which may not be for everyone depending on how long they've already been trying. But it's kept our treatments within the window of what is mostly covered by my insurance which meets our financial needs at this time. This clinic has many strengths, in my opinion. It is relatively easy to get an appointment within a reasonable timeframe for consults, and they are flexible with scheduling for labs and ultrasounds. They have a very knowledgeable financial counselor who works with insurances to get coverage when possible. They do all of their labs in-house, and results are reported relatively quickly. They have their own embryology labs directly connected to the OR's where they do retrievals, which is great. They require IVF education sessions before beginning a cycle, which is really helpful for getting questions answered about the process in general and what to expect. At the Market Street location, there is street parking, but there is also a garage and they will validate your parking so it's only $5, which is great for Philadelphia! I have not been to the other 2 locations. 

The only weakness that I can report is that your primary doctor may not be the one doing all the procedures. They do have fellows there who are training, but they are well-supervised by the attending physicians. They are busy in the mornings with routine monitoring appointments, but they always get patients through in a fairly quick time, while also taking the time necessary with each patient so you don’t feel you are being rushed. I’ve never had a problem scheduling an appointment when I needed one. All of the staff are very friendly and courteous. Make sure you check in when you get to the desk. I went there one time and the receptionist didn't check me in and they called my phone asking where I was. Ask questions about what is your next step. 

The wait time is under 15-20 minutes. The staff is very friendly. Organized and caring!!  I always felt and feel important to them. I have never felt like a number!!  They are prompt and informative. The financial people are also amazing at helping navigate you through the insurance coverage you might have and fee schedules!!Strengths - Always on time with appointments, in and out. And they always provide fast, accurate feedback. 

Negatives- IVF is too expensive:( for something some of us need to have - our only hope - it’s disheartening to know I can’t afford the one thing that I need. They are very efficient.  They see a LOT of patients, so you may not get as much time with any particular provider as you might want.  You will meet a lot of different doctors.  I like all of them, and have had a very good experience.  But if you are looking for a more homey atmosphere or touchy feely experience, it's not the place for you.  Also it is super convenient to my work-- this is probably the #1 important thing to me, since I have to go so often.  The clinic are clean. They will not transfer your medical records to new practice. so try to get all records when you are their patient. It is well run clinic as it is part of Penn fertility care. They run many centers in Philadelphia region, so you can go to Market st, Wash. Sq and also in Radnor. Wait time at clinic can be long and weekend lab work is only done in Market st. location. I get the impression that this clinic may be more concerned with their statistics than with their patients. There are about a dozen doctors and in my time there, I saw every single doctor once for one procedure or another. After over a year at the clinic, I still felt like a new patient. Strengths: all staff I met with were kind and compassionate, remembered me when I had appointments even after some time off, and held friendly conversations. Also, their pricing is much more reasonable than other area clinics.

Weaknesses: As a result of being such a large clinic, there were times that the level of care didn’t feel personalized, and didn’t include out of the box thinking. I think there could often be a lot of assumptions that the patient knows more than they do.

Advice: arm yourself with information and questions before you go in, and continue to advocate for yourself and for more information. They are always responsive when you ask, but if you don’t ask, they won’t tell you.This is a large practice which can be a negative and a positive. There are multiple offices so for routine visits - labs/US you can switch it up if one works better. There are multiple doctors who review and work together to make decisions on your care during an IVF cycle. They are open 7 days a week and associated with top Philadelphia hospitals. However, there is an element to the practice that can make it feel less personal, and make it harder to get routine consults scheduled. long wait, but everyone was nice enough.  they did not have a dr doing the ultrasound, but an ultrasound technician.  my next clinic ahd a dr doing it.  i have nothign else to say but it wont let me click next until i hit 200 charactersPenn Fertility Care is one of the leading fertility clinics in the country and the doctors in the practice are some of the brightest minds in the field. It is not a small practice, however, and so you have to be willing to be a bit flexible and potentially see other doctors than your primary, and be willing to wait sometimes for appointments. At the end of the day, I wanted top care from the smartest doctors, and I felt Penn Fertility delivered me that.The clinic at Radnor is well organized and run. The prices for self-pay patients seem to be more reasonable for everything (treatment and meds) than anywhere else I've researched or read about. It is less busy than the office at 3701 Market and for some things you would still need to go to their University City location, but for monitoring, etc, I was at Radnor.

However, you will rarely see a physician during your actual treatment. All monitoring is coordinated through the nursing staff. You'll have an ultrasound technician do your scans and a tech to do your blood draws. You sometimes can see a nurse or the nurse pratictioner after your monitoring appt, but your nurse will call in the afternoon with an update to your plan. 

The entire team including the faculty and the fellows will meet and discuss cases. After a treatment fails, they will discuss recommendations for the next round (I don't know if this is for all cases or just more difficult ones, but it happened for mine without any prompting or request and I got the impression that this is just what they do). Front desk staff can be a little temperamental and can make you feel likes bother.  Overall all of the staff at the clinic, however, are fantastic.  Parking is a pain and can be expensive.The only weakness is that because it's a large teaching hospital, you someone different for your monitoring appointments. My annuals and consults were always with Dr Sondheimer. Strengths- many great doctors that collaborate on cases. Cutting edge research. Ease of appointments. I was always made comfortable, informed and I felt that I was in great hands. You will see a Fellow most likely for ultrasounds (many other practices have techs and don't tell you what is going on while it is happening)
Weaknesses- this turned out to be a strength for me personally in hindsight but you see many different fellows/doctors for ultrasounds, IUIs anything but consulting appointments. Your main doctor will be the primary decision maker but you won't see them for every appointment. I wish I knew that upfront and it bothered my during my first cycle but when I came back for the second cycle- I was aware and embraced it and asked many different doctors questions.Everyone at the clinic is very friendly, helpful, supportive.  The only negative was sometimes long wait times for monitoring appointments.  It really is a team environment there and everyone seems invested in the patient care and excellent outcomesI think that Penn is VERY expensive. When I met with their financial rep, she said that IUIs typically bill out at $5,000. Also, they billed all of my diagnostic testing as 'infertility' so my tests started billing against my insurance lifetime maximum. I felt like they were sucking my few insurance dollars dry. 

In terms of the clinic, it is clean and typically runs on time. It was rare that I had to wait over 15 minutes. It's more like a doctor's office than a clinic. For example, I happened to go with a friend to another fertility clinic and it felt more comprehensively about getting you pregnant -- almost a marketing thing, really. Since Penn is a research hospital it was much more about --here's our latest research study, you can sign up, and just more of a doctor's office. I was more than happy to participate in the research though and appreciated being part of that, and I knew that my doctors were up on the latest research and treatments. I have heard that there are other clinics that are just focused on numbers, numbers, numbers, and they are potentially more aggressive with drugs etc, I don't know details on that, but I never felt that way at Penn and felt that I was part of a great health system and system of doctors, nurses and researchers who were contributing to the greater good and also getting us a baby. (Who is the best thing that's every happened! He is so awesome!)It was 100% a cattle call. Very very very long waits. Rushed in and out of ultrasounds with techs who were not caring at all (hard to take when you are paying out of pocket!) Also they allowed children in the waiting area which was painful at the time. Terrible. We hated our experience with this group. They screwed up appointments for us, booked us at wrong offices, weren’t watching protocols closely. We felt like I was the only advocate for our treatment. The didn’t even call us back after bloodwork pre IUI!Arrive early, appointments start exactly on time. I have never waited more than 15 minutes before being called back for appointment. Allow extra time to ask questions if needed. Labs and pharmacy are all located close by, literally within blocks of each other or in the same building.UPenn at Washington square is a great facility; it’s clean, the nursing staffs are friendly and welcoming, the patients are treated with respect and they are very prompt with appointment times. The front desk staff could be a little more welcoming.Very professional and caring team. Since they are a university hospital, they don’t decline patients as other clinics do. Doctors and nurses are very compassionate and you can tell that they are not in for your money. The only challenge I see is that they have so many patients and sometimes I feel like I am just a number and I don’t always get personalized treatment. Regardless, I have only good things to say about everyone I have worked with at Penn Fertility. Overwhelmed and unavailable at times which caused undue stress to patients. The clinical was flexible with scheduling and the turn around time from initial visit to treatment was quick. Wouldn't advise a young patient to go here as my case wasn't considered to be as bad as others which I feel often the severity of my case was overlooked and I was often told your young so you have timeProfessional and clean. Typically appointments run on time. Only do ultrasounds and IUI's in the morning which is difficult for someone who doesn't work a traditional schedule. Strengths:  location, clean, staff was very friendly and did show compassion 
Weakness: front desk office is in a main hallway which is not private and forces you to have a personal conversation in a public hallway.  After an IUI, I did not get a follow up call from nurses or staff to discuss my next options or at least to check on me.  There were no notable weaknesses.  It is a teaching facility so there were extra student involved but I didn't mind. Overall it's a great facility.  Things were run very well. Scheduling,  billing and treatment were simple. Clinic was very cleaned and maintained privacy. Clinic was spacious with a lot of room to move around. Waiting time is less than 15 minutes before being called back for appointments. Weakness are parking but the clinic is in center city Philadelphia so that comes with the territory. I wish my nurse would be more throughrough in why my protocal was chosen and expectations and next steps Strength the office is  convient and they validate parking . The waiting is always clean and they water ,tv and reading material 
weakness  returning calls timely ( not the nurse staff the finance team) The monitoring appointments were from 6:45 to 9 am and they were very convenient for my work schedule. Your wait time was minimal and you were seen, in and out quickly.They were scheduled times with a first come first served policy.  Through the years I got to know both the sweet lab technician and the wonderful ultrasound tech!  They were always understanding and excited when all was going well or on the harder days too!!The appointments were in the AM (I would go before work) so they could also draw blood (if necessary) and it would leave time for the doctors to review results and adjust your meds if necessary.
It was a well oiled machine that ran very smoothly.It is always efficient. A quick in and out. I could go for a monitor and get back to work without being late for work ",7.900000000000003,8.300000000000002,The Penn fertility nursing staff is highly variable. I have also experienced incredible wait times for appointments.

81,University of Pennsylvania Penn Fertility Care,protocol,"I did a few IUIs with her-- either 2 or 3.  I used letrozole alone for the first one, but my ovulation was hard to predict.  On the second (and third?) I used letrozole and Ovidrel.  Unfortunately none resulted in a pregnancy.Dr Kalra used all of our day 3 testing results to decide which protocol to use. She said my AMH was within normal range so she used what they called a high responder protocol. It worked and we had a smooth and successful retrieval with embryos to freeze.  Our first transfer was unsuccessful but our frozen embryo transfer gave us a BFP.It was awhile ago so numbers are a bit vague but we started with clomid, and IUI's.  then when I had a blighted ovum decided to move to donor eggs.  Their donor pool was small and we decided to move to a larger base.  We did do a few IUI's and I recall it was a pain to go into the city to do that specific procedure whil everything else was done in radnor.I can’t recall exactly. He used clinks for IUI and froze all embryos for PGS due to my prior natural miscarriages. All my FETs were controlled (medicaged). Before starting any process, a hysterosalpingogram was performed and due to the results a laparoscopy followed. Once these procedures were completed, discussions about IVF followed. The IVF protocol I was prescribed was Lupron 10 units & Gonal F 400 units for egg retrieval resulted in 24 eggs being retrieved. This protocol was used because my previous cycle was canceled.The IVF protocol for frozen transfer was Lupron & Progesterone which resulted in a positive pregnancy which was later on miscarried.For my first cycle an agonist protocol was used. I produced a lot of eggs but only had 1 left on day 5 to transfer.  For my next 2 cycles antagonist protocols with human growth hormone (both freeze all and then frozen embryo transfers) were used and these were more successful (4 embryos and then 3 embryos to freeze). FSH / GNRH Antagonistic Protocol - the plan was to do PGS and frozen cycle(s) so the goal was to push my body a little harder than if we were doing fresh. The Dr wanted to be careful since I have a higher AMH about OHSS/over-responsiveness. We had around 12-15 mature follicles in each ovary prior to retrieval but they were only able to get 7 eggs out. After receiving the initial testing back, Dr. Kalra told us to try on our own for a few months. We did and it resulted in a pregnancy that then ended in miscarriage (#3). We met with her again and she told us to try on our own. When nothing happened after 4 months, I started Clomid and timed intercourse. The following month we did Clomid and IUI, which failed. I then got my period too soon and thankfully a wonderful NP stepped in and viewed my chart and changed me to Letrozole. We then did three more IUI cycles, all which failed. During this time, I did not have any communication with Dr. Kalra and had it not been for the WONDERFUL NP, I most likely would have left Penn. 

Following the IUI failures, we met with Dr. Kalra again and were going to move towards IVF. However, I ended up getting a new job, and we put that on hold for the summer. Low and behold, I ended up pregnant again on my own, with yet another miscarriage (#4). Now we are awaiting results and another doctors visit. We haven’t started any treatment as of yet, but she recommended IVF for us. We’ll be going over the details at our next appointment.My fresh cycle and retrieval cycle I was on a “high responder” protocol. My stim meds started out low and I used them for 9 days before trigger. I was only on progesterone for yhe transfer and it was not successful. For my frozen transfer I was on an antagonist protocol. I took Lupron during my leutal phase, got a cycle then started estrace, aspirin and started progesterone 6 days before transfer. Currently waiting to see if this was successful After my initial testing (bloodwork, ultrasound), I had a hysteroscopy to evaluate whether or not I had a uterine polyp. Dr. Mainigi wanted to take this step after one of my ultrasounds because the alternative was to wait and do a second ultrasound weeks later -- which, in addition to not being efficient, wouldn't have enabled her to treat any polyps if she found them. Post procedure, she recommended that I begin IUI because she knew that I had already been trying for a long time and was eager to move forward as quickly as possible. She was very understanding when I delayed this by a couple of months after finding out that my insurance doesn't cover any fertility treatments, and supported my decision to try Clomid alone for two months. When that didn't work, we started the IUI process. I'm undergoing my first round now -- She generally recommends 3 rounds of IUI before moving on to IVF. I have PCOS, and was put on letrozole protocol (days 4-8), as it is shown to be more effective than Clomid in PCOS. Given that we have the expense of donor sperm, Dr. O'Neill offered to do monitored cycles with trigger shots to optimize our timing for IUI insemination. She also offered to let us use home OPKs if we preferred to have a less invasive/clinical approach to conception as a lesbian couple without ""proven infertility"" (by insurance standards). We opted for the monitored cycles, but appreciated her sensitivity to our situation. We have not been successful in our first four cycles so far, and are in the TWW for our 5th.Initially we tried estrogen pill priming, then a course of daily Gonal-F and Menopur with ganirelix added at the end of the cycle. The outcome was initially as expected. For the next cycle, Dr. Butts suggested a different protocol with estrogen priming, then twice daily micro dose Lupron and daily Gonal F. We saw improvement in results the second time, which really boosted my confidence is Dr. Butt’s ability to alter the protocol using information gained from previous cycles. We used he second protocol for the third cycle as well which was successful. We did two double embryo transfers with Dr. Edwards. The first was just standard care but we had already had one negative result from a fresh transfer, high-grade embryo and one frozen high-grade embryo. The first double transfer results in nothing. After that, and much discussion, he decided to push the transfer date back by a day for the second double transfer. That resulted in an early miscarriage at around 7 weeks. I did 6 medicated (clomid/letrozole) rounds and IUI before we were approved for IVF. All were negative. I went throw two egg retrieval rounds with her. We were lucky enough to have insurance coverage so we asked that she be as aggressive as possible because we didn't want to waste the coverage. She said she ""was"" but then after our first retrieval all embryos arrested after 5 days. The next time around she changed the medication, added in a course of HGH and we ended up with 6 embryos after 6 days of development. I did one fresh transfer which was negative and then one additional frozen transfer with her which resulted in a chemical pregnancy. After that point my husband and I both felt we didn't want to work with her anymore and asked to switch to a different, warmer doctor within the clinic. I have been taking the highest dosage allowed of Clomid coupled with an Ovidrel shot to trigger ovulation and timed intercourse. That combination works best for me - other options have not worked. Because I have PCOS and annovulation, she has not recommended that we move onto Clomid and IUI. IUI isn't going to increase our chances all that much more and because it isn't covered by my insurance, she doesn't think it's something we necessarily need to consider. This treatment combination has produced one strong follicle in 4 of the 5 cycles we've completed. We had no reaction in the last cycle which caused us to take a break for the summer. We just resumed last week and are in the middle of a sixth Clomid cycle now. I did a stimulation protocol as follows:

1. Lupron for 10 days
2. Start Gonal-F 
3. Add Menopur
4. hCG trigger shot

I had monitoring appointments daily during stimulation. I have PCOS, so there was a slight concern of OHSS. My doctor retrieved 23 eggs, 19 of which fertilized. 8 of those matured, 5 were frozen on Day 5, and 3 were frozen on Day 6. I don't recall the exact grading, but my doctor assured me that they only ever froze embryos they thought would be successful as FET's.I did 3 IVF cycles using a combination of lupron, menopur and follistim. I have low AMH/DOR and a thin lining. I was only able to produce 9 eggs on my best cycle, and 4 eggs on my worst. Those 3 cycles resulted in 2 total embryos that were frozen for later FETs. Dr. Masson performed 2 TESEs for my husband and he recommended that he take Ubiquinol, Vitamin D and Ester C for a few months prior to the procedure. The first time, my husband was not aware of these recommendations but the TESE did yield viable sperm. He DID take the recommended supplements before the second TESE, which yielded sperm of approximately the same quality as the first time. So I can't say whether or not the supplements helped, but both procedures did yield useable sperm. I began birth control for a few weeks and then went on 10ml of lupron. On the second day of my period I had a baseline ultrasound to check my ovaries and lining. I started injections (5ml lupron in the morning and 375ml Gonal F in the evening). I had bloodwork and ultrasounds to check my hormone levels and follicle development 4 days later and my dose changed to 5ml Lupron, 300 Gonal F and 150 menopur for the rest of the days. I took my HCG trigger shot on  day 11 and had my egg retrieval on day 13 (36 after my trigger shot.) 
I sent my embryos out for PGS testing and i'm waiting on the results. 

I don't know the strategies behind or rational because I just did what the nurse told me to do. I did two iuis with her using an antagonist protocol, then we did and hsg which showed I more than likely have a blocked right tube. We tried a microdose Lupron ivf protocol which never led to a retrieval and was cancelled on cycle day 13 after no growth. I am currently in the tww after a succeful ivf cycle called the estrogen patch protocol and an antagonist protocol. Antagonist protocol for egg retrieval (BCP, Follistim, Menopur, Ganirellex). For transfers BCP, Lupron, Estrace, PIO, but ultimately what worked was a natural FET with only Crinone. I did the first 8-10 cycles taking letrozole and times intercourse. We moved to letrozole and IUI because that did not work. Due to my PCOS, ovulation was unclear so we introduced ovidrel shots as well. I reacted fine to all of this, the 2.5 mg of letrozole day 3-7 just made me a little more emotional than usual. Then we moved to gonal-f injectables with IUI. This cycle was longer because we started on too low of a dose. At this point we are back to monitoring with oral meds and times intercourse while saving for the inevitable (IVF). After a couple of failed letrozole IUIs, I tried a few rounds of clomid IUI.  When that didn't work, I added injectables (Follistim).  All of those were with Ovidrel trigger.  After round 9, I moved to IVF using Gonal F, Menopur, Ganarelix, and Novarel trigger.  My retrieval is tomorrow.  I have 7 follicles right now.  We discussed switching to IUI but Dr Sondheimer didn't recommend it.  I am hoping for at least a few embryos.  All have this has been with donor sperm, as my partner is another woman. 3 cycles of Clomid (100mg) and timed intercourse. No rationale, just trying if it works I was on a high-responder protocol. I was on Follistim 150 daily to start. Eventually added in Ganirelix and menopur. Eventually we attempted HGH because of a cycle that resulted in poor quality embryos, howevery retrieval was cancelled.After a few Clomid/IUI cycles where many were canceled because my right ovary was working but my right tube had been removed, we moved onto IVF. The first protocol was the high dose protocol of Gonal F and Menopur with a Lipton primer. It was canceled due to poor response. My second cycle was the Lipton flare protocol. We went to retrieval expecting 2 eggs but the one follicle was empty and the other fell apart overnight. I have never been pregnant. Since then, I had my endometriosis removed and have read about low stimulation protocols working better in patients with DOR. I spoke to her about that and she didn’t agree and said donor eggs would be my best bet. She may be right, but I’m not ready to give up on myself yet, so I am switching clinics.Dr. Senapati understood that I wanted to avoid IVF if at all possible, so we exhausted every approach to IUI first. Unfortunately, my extremely sensitive ovaries made this difficult. After I overreacted to even the lowest dose of Clomid, we switched to Letrozole cycles. After I underreacted to even the highest dose of Letrozole, we switched to a hybrid Letrozole+Gonal F cycle. When that didn't work, we used exclusively Gonal F because the dosage can be calibrated so precisely. In the end, we did 14 hormone cycles, with 7 cancelled cycles and 7 IUIs. At that point she recommended we discontinue IUI, so we switched to IVF and I got pregnant after my first embryo transfer.Clomid 100mg x3 w TI resulted in 2-3 mature follicles w BFP then miscarriage for 2/3 cycles. 
Currently starting IVF w a Lupron overlap/follistim protocol. She does not monitor you closely enough.  I was on menopur, ganirelix, and I forgot the name of the third one- starts with an F and is the pen shot.  After I started ganirelix she waited over 48 hours to run my bloods.  I have since learned that ganirelix commonly can have an adverse impact on people's estrogen and they need to be monitored closely when started to see if other drugs should be increased to offset the effects.  That did not happen with Dr ButtsGiven my issue was ovulation and PCOS, Dr. Kalra put me on a high-responder protocol which worked well. While she warned me about OHSS and said up front they might have to do a ""freeze all"" given the amount of follicles I had, because of the protocol, we received 26 eggs and I was able to do a fresh transfer. leading up to the retrieval I was in the office every day and she did my final ultra-sounds herself (instead of the ultra sound tech) and gave me rational for why she wanted to wait one more day and then ultimately when I was ready for my trigger. I feel as though her care leading up to my transfer was why I was able to recover quickly and was able to have the transfer 5 days later (which ended up as a BFP :))Dr. Shah debated between an antagonist protocol (which she selected) and another type of protocol (not sure what that would have been) based on my DOR diagnosis and relatively young (in infertility world) age. The logic for going with the specific protocol was never relayed to me. Did a natural start, 450 gonal f for days 1-5, then ganarelix was added, and I went to gonal f 300 + menopure 150. I had a dominant follicle by day 7 which they warned me might get me cancelled and by day 9 they cancelled the cycle and converted me to IUI that didn't work.My protocol was the hyperstimulation protocol due to my PCOS.  I was very carefully monitored and was lucky to have no adverse side effects and a very successful round of stimulation and retrieval.I don't remember all the medications for the egg retrieval. I know I started on bcp, was on follistim, menapur and I believe Gonal-F. 
For the IUIs, I do an ultrasound and baseline bloodwork on Day 3 of my cycle, 50 mg of Clomid days 4-8, another ultrasound on Day 12 to check the follicles. The first IUI I did the trigger shot (Ovidrel) the night of CD 12 and had the IUI morning of CD 14. The second time, they did bloodwork on CD 12 to check for an LH surge which I was starting so I triggered as soon as they got the blood results back, 3pm CD 12 and had the IUI the morning of CD 13. I take an at-home pregnancy test two weeks later and call the office with the results. Due to my low AMH and single ovary, if this cycle doesn't work I'll likely move to IVF. 
I was on a hyper response IVF protocol due to having PCOS (my understanding of it is that lower doses of injectible meds are used to avoid overstimulating the ovaries).  My stimulation phase took several days longer than expected, which meant having to order additional meds, but the eggs produced were very good quality even though the total number was not as high as might be expected with a regular IVF cycle.  We ended up with 6 high quality 5 day embryos from that cycle.  I was a DOR patient based off of egg counts and my AMH level so they treated me very aggressively in my first cycle. I forget the name of the protocol but I think it was ""mini Lupron"". I got canceled after my first ultrasound after having a lead egg (I can't remember the terminology!) so they converted it to an IUI.
After that, Dr. Sondheimer treated me with a typical cycle instead of one more used for DOR patients. I used high dosages of Follistim though. I had 6 eggs at my baseline and had 7 mature. They retrieved all and 4 made it to Day 5 embryos. We transferred 2 the first round and I had a singleton (now 4). We transferred two frozen 2 years later and my twins are now 2.I did a luteal lupron downregulation IVF cycle with Follistim and Menopur.   I did not use birth control pills.  I used intramuscular progesterone support following egg retrieval.Dr Dokras tried to push me immediately to IUI procedures. She did not even offer Clomid and regular intercourse as an option. It was only after I did research and I asked direct questions that she mentioned it was possible. Also, she did not talk about the plan if the IUI didn't work. I had no idea how long I would be doing Clomid and IUIs. He started with the least interventionist, IUI, but quickly recommended I consider switching to full IVF when our first attempts weren't successful. I think they expected, due to my numbers and my husband's previous experience, it to be more successful than it was the first time, but then when it wasn't he encouraged us to ""step it up"" and I was glad about that. He didn't seem focused on success in numbers, though -- he seemed focused on success with me as an individual in having a baby. He was thoughtful about how many embryos to put in, and he knew how to explain my choices at each step of the way and letting us know when there was really no right answer -- and when there sort of was a ""right answer"" if we wanted to up our chances of getting pregnant. I can't remember the specirics of my protocols -- I did lots of injections and they had me doing the progesterone shots for 10 full weeks after I got pregnant, in order to help the pregnancy succeed . . . The Antagonist protocol. That's all they would do for IVF. Unless you were over 35 or PCOS, nothing else would be considered. They even met as a committee to discuss it. 

For IUI they did try Letrazole for me instead of Clomid as a previous clinic had done, and I got pregnant twice on it (though no success.) IUIs. First we did a natural IUI, the second time I requested I was on a medication so he dose Letroxol My husband had the TESE (surgical sperm extraction) however the surgery unfortunately yielded no sperm. However after the surgery Dr. Masson gently gave us the news and allowed us time to “take it all in”. The next day he called us directly to check on us and again asked if we had any questions. Dr. Masson and his staff were always easy and readily available via email and phone calls.I did lupron 10 units every morning for 12 days, then gonorilex I think. Not sureThe embryos were already tested, but were not implanting. We did two ERAs because we only had one viable embyat the end and we wanted to make sure 100% that I was receptive at time of transfer if last good embryo. Unfortunately, it didn’t implant. Tubal check was the initial procedure to make sure my tubes were open followed by surgery was the initial treatment. I was first put on clomid and then moved to ivfFrequent ultrasounds and blood work for baseline and process tracking in each cycle. Letrozol day 3-7....then trigger shot.  I was put on the pill to ease surgery scheduling.  I had a laparoscopy done to check for and treat endometriosis. I conceived naturally following the laparoscopy.  So far we have only been through consultations and are in the works of developing a treatment plan.3 iuis and then ivf. For ivf she did long Lupron, honestly I'm not sure why! We explored many options before we achieved our goal - including IUI, drugs to enhance egg production, etc. I also had a surgery to have a large fibroid removed (myomectomy). In the end, we used an egg donor and, after a miscarriage, had a successful live birth. It was a long road but Dr Edwards helped us at every step along the way. I don’t remember sorry For IVF she used Lupron and follistim and menopur for the stim. She uses estrace and progesterone to prep for transfer. The clinic follows the national recommended guidelines for embryo transfer. Due to my age, we transferred 1 embryo each time. Dr. Shah never pushed me to transfer more than 1 and I never asked to.  Dr. Senapati's preferences for single embryo transfer aligned with my own, so we didn't have to discuss it much. From what we did discuss, I felt confident that it was the best choice for my health and for my pregnancy goals. I also felt that the choice was my own and I could have gone a different way if I'd wanted to.The practice in general seemed very adverse to multiple babies, so they seemed happy I wanted to do genetic testing with just 1 normal embryo transfer.He was comfortable transferring two embryos after we had been through two transfers with no positive outcome. n/a- I did not do IVF with herI was told that, due to my age, only one embryo is recommended. I was not given an option for multiples.On the first cycle, she recommended transferring one embryo. It was an easy decision to make; it was our first cycle, we had seven frozen embryos (all good quality), and we were in our early thirties. When our first cycle didn't work, she recommended we transfer two embryos on the next cycle. My husband and I were very torn about it; we were concerned about the risks with twins (for the babies, myself, and the financial strain). When she knew I was having a hard time with this recommendation, she spoke at length with me on the phone. She assured me that there was nothing wrong with my embryos (which was my concern), but they recommended two simply because the first round didn't work. There was no other reason why; they just wanted to up my chances. She told me she was cautiously optimistic and didn't feel that we needed to change anything else just yet, so if we were more comfortable with transferring one, that's what we should do (and what we ended up doing with success). They allowed me to do a 2 embryo transfer for a FET after a failed single embryo fresh transfer. I was 34 and he fevimmended we don’t transfer two at a time. I am now almost 39 and still not pregnant...My doctor was willing to do either eSET or 2 embryo transfer depending on the situation and my preference. Our Dr strongly encouraged single embryo transfers, it didn't feel like there was an option for anything elseShe stated that for young couples, I believe under 35 years of age, she would recommend single embryo transfer, but I think it would ultimately be the patient’s decision.Dr Barnhart was open to transferring 2 embryos after my failed fresh cycle.N/aI have not gotten to this stage yet. She was very set on eSET but this was also preferred by my insurance so we did follow through with two single transfers with her. I did not have an embryo transfer yet, but my doctor usually recommends single embryo transfer, because transferring 2 doesn't significantly increase your chance of pregnancy, and also to avoid the risk that comes with carrying multiples.My doctor was willing to transfer multiple embryos if the quality wasn’t great. But in my case I only had 2 to work with so we did 2 separate single embryo transfers. Dr. Shah does not perform multiple embryo transfer to my knowledge. He has a strong preference for only transferring 1 frozen embryo at a time.  If I do a fresh transfer, he will put in 2.We got the lecture about risks of multiples to the nth degree. I was told I would be the next octomom if we transferred two embryos! N/A - I never had an embryo to transferIn the case of PGS testing Dr Edwards recommended a single transfer  didnt get that farWe left the group before IVFN/aProper count if follicles I developed ovarian cyst during ivf treatment which were initially mistaken as folliclesDidn't experience this.  I'd love more insight on why a protocal was chosen for me He only does 1 embryo . He said multiple is to risky  on the first transfer.Her approach was elective single embryo transfer for both the fresh and frozen transfer. However, I inquired about multiple embryo transfers due to my age and she discussed with me the pros, cons, and trade offs and she is willing to transfer multiples.Because of my low amh and my age, we decided to transfer two eggs to give me the best chance of a positive pregnancy test. I completely agree. The practice encouraged me to transfer 2 each time. I was hesitant during my frozen transfer but I listened and had a multiple pregnancy. Looking back, I wouldn't change it but it was a shock to the system when I found out both took.Dr. Scott told me he prefers one embryo transfer due to the risk of multiple, but it is completely up to the patient ",7.900000000000003,8.300000000000002,"I did a few IUIs with her-- either 2 or 3. After that point my husband and I both felt we didn't want to work with her anymore and asked to switch to a different, warmer doctor within the clinic. At this point we are back to monitoring with oral meds and times intercourse while saving for the inevitable (IVF). I had a dominant follicle by day 7 which they warned me might get me cancelled and by day 9 they cancelled the cycle and converted me to IUI that didn't work. I can't remember the specirics of my protocols -- I did lots of injections and they had me doing the progesterone shots for 10 full weeks after I got pregnant, in order to help the pregnancy succeed . . ."
82,University of Pennsylvania Penn Fertility Care,cost,"I don't recall.  We did have insurance to cover some of the procedures and I remember that they sat down and went over everything with me.  It was overwhelming but they knew their stuff and explained it all.We paid for both transfers out of pocket with Dr. Edwards, both were $2,500 each which we knew up front. As I mentioned in another section, I really was not impressed with the financial person whatsoever. She was cold and unprofessional, didn't follow through on some requests and talked to us like we were children. The charges associated with my husband's TESE were extremely unclear. We got multiple bills that we were not expecting and they do not inform you about costs associated with sperm storage. It was just about all covered by insurance, besides a $150 sperm washing fee.Mostly covered by insurance. Trigger shot was $30. Clomid/Femara $10. Bloodwork $50. HSG $180. IVF ???? likely in the neighborhood of $7-10kWe purchased a package deal, only $6,750 for one egg retrieval and 2 transfers, whether fresh or frozen. We were able to take out a loan from Arc Fertility. We bought the medications at the pharmacy onsite and saved a ton of money. We probably spent close to 2 grand, but that's a bargain. IUIs were 1000 each not including trigger shot and clomic
IVF was 6775 for retrieval and 2 transfers (I ended up doing 1 fresh and 1 frozen)
My meds for stims were 1800
Meds for FET 350
Overall they are extremely affordable in comparison to many other clinicsWe were lucky to have IVF coverage through our insurance and only had to pay 10% deductible and co-pays.  The financial counselors at the clinic were very helpful in confirming our insurance coverage and explaining to us what our remaining cost would be for each procedure before starting that treatment.Covered mostly by my insurance.My first round of IVF was covered with my insurance.  I am currently in my second round of IVF and am expecting to have to pay for 1/2 of the cycle out of pocket.  My insurance pays for most of my treatment.  Considering  IUI that will be a cost of around $500I had full coverage for 2 egg retrieval and 2 fresh transfer. But a FET is 2500$ $30k maybe. My first cycle was about $10,500. My second cycle was $5500 ( and $2000 for an additional frozen embryo transfer cycle).  My third cycle was $8500.  None of these prices included medications which were an additional $2500-$3500 each full cycle.  There are also embryo storage fees that are about $250 every few months. Retrieval & biopsy - $9,000; FETs $2,500 (these prices have now been updated & significantly increased) The four rounds of failed IUI cost me about $1000 out of pocket. I haven’t completed treatment, but I believe IVF will cost about $15,000. Medications alone will cost a couple thousand and egg freezing will cost about $500 for 3 months (I believe).The IVF package did not include embryo freezing, testing, or a mov transfer. I had a great insurance plan during my initial visits and hysteroscopy, so I only had to pay $10 copays. Under my new insurance, I've had to pay for everything. The Clomid costs about $16/month (for 10 pills). A round of IUI is $1000 and a round of IVF is $8000. I was also told that IUI with injections is $2000 but I haven't undergone this procedure and don't know very much about it. Those prices do not include associated prescriptions. The one injection for my IUI was around $35 under my insurance plan. I believe I paid around $100 for my most recent consultation. IUI cycles are $1000 plus medsAll costs were paid out of pocket. Fees for an egg freezing cycle were extremely reasonable. Penn gets a drug discount that is passed on to the patient. I paid 1/3 the cost of medications compared to what I would have paid at another clinic, saving me thousands of dollars. Of course I would have paid full price is necessary, but getting the same medications for less was a nice benefit. I was very lucky in that we had 6 IUIs, 2 retrievals and 2 transfers covered by our insurance. We had to pay for ICSI out of pocket as well as for embryo preservation. Those costs were reasonable but also weren't totally disclosed to us up front. We didn't realize that certain things were covered by insurance and others were not. ICSI was decided on the day of our retrieval so we were hit with a bill later which we were not expecting. It was okay for us but I could imagine for many couples it would not be. Approximately $5,000 out of pocket costs with insurance coverage including required mock transfer (out of pocket only), medications, and co-pays/deductibles. I was very fortunate to have insurance that covered fertility treatments entirely. I paid copays for my appointments. The embryo storage fee I believe was $550 for the initial freeze + 3 months, and then $225 billed quarterly after that.Costs were minimal because I work in that health system and my insurance covered nearly everything in network. Once I hit my IVF insurance cap I had to pay $5k-$8k on remaining meds. From June 2017 until now $62,567 in medical expenses not including prescription drugs. I still have to do the IVF transfer after the PGS results come in. My insurance has covered everything except the gonal-f to date. IVF begins at $8,500. PGS testing is an additional $6,000 and meds between $2k and $5k. My insurance covered everything for IUIs except for Ovidrel ($35), and donor sperm washing ($150).  For IVF most things have been covered.  I think genetic testing (PGS) will be around $1850was covered by insuranceWe paid separately for the egg retrieval ($12,000), FET ($2,500). PGD was paid directly to the lab and meds were separate. I must also say that the Financial coordinator is extremely unhelpful! We were better off googling. At my first meeting with her, I asked her what options there were for paying (do people ever take out loans, are there assistance programs, any opportunities for discounted meds, etc) and she looked at me like I had 12 heads. IUI was covered by insurance, so I’m not sure if that.
One complete IVF cycle - $8,000 plus approx $4K in medsIVF cycle $8,500. 
PGS biopsy $2,000. 
IVF meds administered via hospital pharmacy at a discounted rate for OOP patients. pricey but not terribleI have good insurance so IVF was covered at 80% for me. I was also able to get them to cover a large portion of the medications needed for stimulation so I believe it was around $1200 total.Prices changed July 2016 and I do not know current rates. 6750 covered one retrieval and 2 transfers (1 fresh, 1 frozen or 2 frozen) and ALL embryology, anesthesia, monitoring, bloodwork, mock transfer, etc. Everything. Cancelation before retrieval netted a refund of all but 1500. There were other graduated refunds possible (ie only one transfer, but no embryos to transfer reduced cost to 5000).

1 retrieval and 1 transfer (fresh or frozen) was 5000, but the only refund possible was if your cycle was cancelled before retrieval (cost reduced to $1500). This also included absolutely everything (monitoring, embryology, icsi, bloodwork, education seminar, med training). 

Approx $6800 for 1 fresh and 1 frozen cycle, retrieval, all monitoring.  Meds not included. They cost about another $2000 given my particular insurance coverage (or lack there of)I don't recall the costs for egg retrieval. IUI is covered by my insurance. everything was covered by insuranceThis clinic is very expensive. They think you will pay any amount for their brand name. IUIs bill out to insurance around $5k and IVF bills out around $22kEverything was covered under my health insurance and the process that I had to go through with it was very efficient and easy to navigate with the staff person working on it.IUI procedure, meds, ovadril shot, Monoriting and consults (that you have to book if you ever want to speak or hear from your physician )Only costs so far have been cost of consults $50 and all semen analyses have been covered by insurance (out of pocket would have been $100). $15k. About $18,000We're lucky to have it all covered by insurance once meeting our deductible $250 for iui I do not recall exact costs but know all was covered by insurance and I paid just $35 copay, plus $100 surgical copay. Three post surgical appts were also included. So far have only done consultation with Dr. Edwards. Based on my insurance each consult or appointment will typically cost $50.So far insurance coverage Around 9k2019, Invocell was $6500 and IVF was $8500. Both included single embryo transfer, mock transfer, blood draws, ultrasound checks, and storage. IVF transfers were $2500.00. In 2020, IVF transfers are $3500.I have insurance coverage to a certain capped amount, so I only paid a copay for dr visits and for donor sperm related costs. Medication coverage limits were reached so I pay all Meds out of pocket. I was fortunate to have been covered by my insurance.Almost almost 25 thousand ",7.900000000000003,8.300000000000002,"We did have insurance to cover some of the procedures and I remember that they sat down and went over everything with me.
